 "  was held in almaty ,  at which leading experts on the central asian region gathered . 
from the point of view of aleksey malashenko ,  a research fellow of the carnegie moscow centre ,  the forum was important because it helped to model the development of the situation in afghanistan over the near future . 
the majority of speakers agreed that ,  despite the difficulties ,  afghanistan is gradually returning to a peaceful life . 
such positive trends are the result of common efforts on the part of the international community and the special programmes which are being implemented in the country . 
a report will soon be published on the results of the almaty conference which will include recommendations to concerned governments and international organisations ,  and the outlines of plans for future research ,  meetings and joint work . 
the flight route will be shared by tajik and uzbek air carriers . 
dushanbe-an agreement on resuming direct flights between dushanbe and tashkent was reached march <num>4</num>  in uzbekistans capital following negotiations between the heads of tajik and uzbek national airlines . 
the airlines expect the flights to be twice weekly ,  with the price of a one-way ticket not to exceed us$150 . 
these transportation difficulties have had a negative impact on the tajikistan economy ,  which depends on importing goods . 
 " any delays on the uzbek border directly impact domestic manufacturers and others who depend on imports . 
 "  the absence of transportation links is also a constant headache in the border regions ,  where ethnic diasporas maintain close ties with relatives in neighbouring countries .

islamabad - it was a day of rejoicing ,  of drum playing ,  and of smiling at strangers . 
pakistans chief justice iftikhar muhammad chaudhry had just been reinstated after a two-year struggle . 
for those assembled in the countrys capital to celebrate ,  anything seemed possible . 
the march was lively ,  as noisy bands of celebrating lawyers passed by playing drums and singing . 
some brought flowers for chaudhry . 
an old man sold spicy vegetable fritters and a boy passed around a platter of fresh coconut . 
saif abbas ,  a consultant who once worked for the asian development bank in islamabad ,  was more clear-eyed about the meaning of the march . 
pakistan is still a poor country with a vast illiterate population and a corrupt ,  unresponsive ruling class ,  he said . 
this country has to take control of its own future ,  which involves education ,  he said holding a flag . 
unfortunately ,  were just not there yet . 
the current system will simply perpetuate the power of the mullahs on one hand ,  he said ,  and the elite ,  who are totally disconnected from the people of this country ,  on the other . 
the development of sports in tajikistan :  problems and prospects
the president of tajikistan emomalee rakhmon and dilshod nazarov ,  the first owner of an olympic permit to beijing ,  china and hammer throw champion of the asian games in qatar
major sports in tajikistan are ,  unfortunately ,  losing their positions ,  said president of the association of sports journalists in tajikistan ,  narzullo latipov . 
in this connection ,  last april he addressed an open letter to the countrys president ,  emomali rakhmon ,  in which he requested that a council on physical culture and sports be formed ,  led by the president of the country personally . 
he believes that there is no co-ordinating body to cover the entire complex of issues . 
moreover ,  in his opinion the committee for youth affairs ,  sports and tourism should be re-organised by creating a committee on physical culture and sports under the government . 
according to latipov ,  the government can in no way be defined as the structure of leadership in the sector . 
in a short period the structure of the sports committee was changed six times . 
the committee leadership also changed ,  and this simply prevented any deep approach to the problem . 
all these nuances together do not promote the development of sports in the country . 
in addition to the organizational problems named ,  many questions exist that must be urgently resolved . 
in particular he noted that the conditions do not exist for developing major sports in the country . 
there are serious problems with the technical equipment for sports clubs and sports facilities . 
the country has no sports equipment that meets world standards . 
there is not one single major sports facility that fully meets todays requirements and seats more than <num>1,000</num>  spectators . 
in a country where the summer temperatures reach <num>50</num>  degrees centigrade ,  there is no sports swimming pool . 
the only swimming pool that is in operation in dushanbe is under re-construction at this time . 
at many of the existing sports facilities there is a lack of hot water ,  and of heating during the winter period ,  latipov said . 
latipov said there are also problems in the public health sphere . 
in any developed country ,  most of the population indulges in sports ,  but in tajikistan no one can say what percentage of the population is trying to improve its health . 
i suggest that it is not more than one percent . 
whereas previously outside sports fields were set up everywhere ,  now there are none . 
we do have sports clubs in the big cities but not every citizen can afford them because they have to pay anything from <num>30</num>  $  to <num>100</num>  $   [ usd ]  a month ,  the journalist complains . 
latipov suggests that a state programme be adopted to develop football over the next <num>5</num>  to <num>10</num>  years . 
he also proposes that in future ,  it becomes the practice for the head of state to meet sportsmen and employees in this sector ,  which may provide a certain incentive to develop sports in the country . 
this year tajikistan will be sending <num>13</num>  sportsmen to the summer olympics in beijing . 
however ,  according to latipov ,  the government of tajikistan has still not determined what kind of assets will be provided for them . 
and this when most neighbouring countries have already resolved this question ,  latipov said . 
kyrgyz ngos go on the offensive

the amendments to the law on non-governmental organisations were proposed by communist party leader iskhak masaliev . 
if passed ,  they will impose tight restrictions on the activities of kyrgyz-based branches of international civil-society organisations and will also increase the number of state authorities entitled to monitor them . 
ngos will also be banned from involvement in political activity . 
director of the human-rights centre citizens against corruption tolekan ismailova said the european commission has warned kyrgyz authorities that if the amendments are passed it will end its mission in the country . 
this view is shared by alisher mamazhanov ,  leader of the youth organisation golden goal ,  who believes the law could be used by authorities to exert pressure on ngos viewed as undesirable . 
dushanbe mayor ready to support business owners in battle with auditors
this dushanbe bakerys sales volume is small ,  but if it is not besieged by a multitude of auditors it may be able to remain afloat during the crisis period . 
tajikistan-on march <num>14</num>  , at a meeting with the capitals business elite ,  dushanbe mayor makhmadsayid ubaidullayev said that business owners must learn to assert their rights in cases of illegal and groundless audits by state agency representatives . 
against this background ,  however ,  small and mid-sized business owners note that tax agency representatives continued to audit their activities without authorisation . 
the state committee on investment and the department for legal protection of business acknowledge that ,  because a presidential decree has less legal force than a law ,  such unauthorised audits have indeed continued . 
they are sure ,  however ,  now that the moratorium has become law unauthorised audits will cease .

kyrgyzstan - education and science minister abdylda musayev said at a march <num>17</num>  parliamentary hearing on preschool education that in the <num>17</num>  years since kyrgyzstan gained independence the number of kindergartens has declined <num>60</num>  percent . 
ministry figures show that of the <num>461</num>  kindergartens in bishkek and osh in <num>1992</num>  , only <num>146</num>  remain open today and just <num>60,000</num>  of the <num>715,000</num>  children under the age of seven attend pre-schools . 
mp gulnara derbisheva wants to require all pre-school children to complete <num>100</num>  hours of preparation for elementary education . 
according to deputy prime minister uktomkhan abdullayev ,  the government will spend more than us$4 million on a project to make that a reality . 
pre-schools currently survive largely on international grants and donations by parents . 
the international catholic fund alone provided us$9 million in <num>2007</num>  - <num>2008</num>  for its education for everyone programme to support pre-schools in the most troubled regions including osh ,  batken ,  and chui . 
the money was used to buy bed sheets ,  furniture ,  games ,  and toys . 
to prevent them from having to close ,  the ministry says that now is the time to think about funding them in the future . 
tajikistan president emomali rakhmon believes that the new organisation will increase the effectiveness of law-making in the country .

tajikistan-on march <num>18</num>  , president emomali rakhmon signed a decree creating a national law centre in tajikistan to improve the quality of legislation and the effectiveness of the law-making process in the country . 
masud akmed ,  director of the imfs department for the middle east and central asia . 
kyrgyz prime minister igor chudinov said that during january and february kyrgyz exports rose by <num>3.2</num>  percent ,  while imports fell by <num>14</num>  percent . 
bomb kills <num>10</num>  civilians in eastern afghanistan
the roadside bombings show the dangers facing the additional <num>17,000</num>  troops the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  has pledged to send to afghanistan this year to battle resurgent taliban militants in the country's south . 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  has transferred much of that technology to afghanistan ,  but officials say well-trained militants have also migrated from iraq ,  bringing with them the knowledge to carry out more deadly attacks . 
also ,  the rural and often mountainous terrain in afghanistan provides even more hiding places for roadside bombs than in iraq ,  which is more developed . 
the march <num>25</num>  blast killed seven people instantly ,  while three others died later of their wounds in hospital ,  said provincial police spokesman wazir pacha . 
six people were also wounded in the attack ,  he added . 
the australian troops who were wounded were on patrol with afghan soldiers in southern uruzgan province ,  said the australian defence department in a statement . 
the roadside bomb blast also wounded their interpreter ,  according to the statement .

indy performing at the a-live music award festival
fifteen different groups took the stage over the course of two days and performed original music . 
in the end ,  nominations were made for the best soul and drive bands . 
having said that ,  the term best is relative . 
the festival was organised as an open creative process and not designed with competition in mind . 
the marathon was first held in june <num>2007</num>  .
as sultan dinassylov ,  founder and organiser of the festival explained :  the overall idea behind our project is to promote the music of songwriters in almaty and the region and encourage a concert-going culture . 
we want music to be performed live . 
fortunately ,  there has ,  over the past few years ,  been a clear movement towards this . 
although the a-live festival is open to musicians of all kinds ,  the most active participants are rock groups who play a variety of different music - not in a mainstream pop format . 
another thing that makes the project particularly valuable to the cultural life of kazakhstans southern capital is the fact that it happens on a regular basis . 
one of almatys cult venues ,  the cinema bar provides a stage for three or four bands a week . 
according to dinassylov ,  the festival originally attracted musicians from almaty . 
now ,  however ,  bands from a variety of towns - including chimkent ,  karaganda and pavlodar - are among the most active participants . 
over thirty bands have performed over the past year of the festival ,  five of them from the provinces . 
kazakhstans neighbours have for years been actively promoting their music culture and live appearances in the open air . 
there is the old new rock festival in yekaterinburg and invasion held annually by the russian station ,  our radio ,  in a number of different cities . 
and these are not the only projects . 
on march <num>20</num>  , the kyrgyz borders agency confirmed two incidents that occurred on kyrgyzstans borders with kazakhstan and uzbekistan . 
border security has now become an important issue for this central asian republic . 
the first incident occurred the night of <abbr>feb.</abbr> 
<num>23</num>  on the border with kazakhstan when three kazakhs arrived at a border crossing and refused to allow border guards to carry out compulsory searches . 
an argument ensued . 
a few hours later <num>14</num>  armed men in two vehicles came to the kazakhs aid and confronted the kyrgyz border guards . 
according to press reports ,  the men were kazakh border guards and used physical violence on their unarmed counterparts at the border . 
the second incident occurred on the night of march <num>16</num> -<num>17</num>  at the shamalduusay border post near intimak-2 . 
according to a government statement ,  uzbekistan made a second attempt to carry out engineering work in no mans land ,  and on the morning of march <num>17</num>  a group of uzbek border guards was illegally sent in . 
the kyrgyz authorities responded by deploying a detachment of border guards and the boru  ( wolf )  special task force ,  whereupon the uzbek border guards withdrew . 
the press office of the kyrgyz borders agency described this section of the border as neither demilitarised nor demarcated . 
having arrived at the scene of the incident on march <num>17</num>  together with <num>40</num>  soldiers ,  he asserted that the territory belonged to uzbekistan . 
following talks ,  both parties provisionally agreed not to post detachments of border guards to the disputed territory and said they would hold further talks to survey it to mutual satisfaction . 
plastic transactions resisted in uzbekistan
atms often do not have cash available for withdrawal . 
tashkent- the government of uzbekistan is in every way possible encouraging the use of plastic money . 
consumers ,  however ,  do not yet fully appreciate the wonders of non-cash transactions and complain that plastic limits their ability to manage their funds independently . 
according to centrobank information ,  the number of debit card accounts in uzbekistan has reached <num>4.5</num>  million and the number of cash terminals  ( atms )  in shopping and service centres exceeds <num>27,000</num>  .
the government is trying to spur the development of the atm network by extending the duration of customs and tax incentives for importing and using atm equipment for plastic transactions through next year . 
other companies follow the same practice . 
in consumers' opinions ,  it is more convenient to have cash than plastic . 
purchases with cards may be made only at supermarkets and there aren't many of them ,  even in tashkent . 
while atms are now beginning to appear in small stores ,  most of them continue to only accept cash . 
iaea approves <num>5</num>  projects in tajikistan
an electron accelerator ,  which tajik scientists hope will replace the argus and have numerous uses . 
dushanbe - the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  has approved five projects in tajikistan that will be carried out over the next three years . 
as health ministry press centre director fotima yakubova said ,  the projects are aimed at helping the central national laboratory analyse residual radioactivity in food and agricultural products and helping similar laboratories in regions that border neighbouring countries ,  since those laboratories have been virtually non-functional since the fall of the ussr because of a lack of modern equipment . 
the projects will cost more than us$1 . 5 million . 
the argus reactor ,  built at the time of the chernobyl nuclear disaster ,  has been idle for more than <num>20</num>  years . 
bearing in mind public opinion ,  politicians in the capital decided to delay the launch of the argus ,  kabutove said . 
he also offered assurances that the nuclear reactor ,  intended for scientific experiments ,  was absolutely safe . 
the particle accelerator that tajik scientists hope will replace the argus will have numerous uses . 
it will aid research on minerals and crops ,  and also help in the decontamination of medical tools . 
if talks end as expected ,  the process of dismantling the argus and building the particle accelerator will be supervised by iaea specialists . 
innocent residents caught in traps set for militants
according to the un ,  there are about <num>10,000</num>  landmines located in tajikistan . 
 ( photo by reuters / nozim kalandarov ) 
the regional department of internal affairs reported that at about <num>10</num>  <abbr>a.m.</abbr>  ,  davronov ,  in search of livestock ,  passed a sign warning of a mined area at the border . 
he tripped on a landmine at the fourth kilometre ,  detonating it . 
he was seriously injured and died on the way to hospital . 
the tajikistan government has repeatedly stated that the mining of the border area by the uzbek government is illegal because the minefields are not marked . 
uzbekistan is not a signatory of the international convention on the prohibition of use ,  stockpiling ,  production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines and on their destruction . 
on multiple occasions tajikistan asked its neighbour to provide maps of the location of minefields so that warning signs for the population can be posted . 
according to the tajik landmine centre ,  a total of more than <num>80</num>  innocent tajikistan residents have been killed by anti-personnel mines on the tajik-uzbek border . 
the head of the ministrys press department ,  faridun mahmadaliyev ,  says that the training will be comprised of two stages and will be conducted pursuant to a decision by the council of the counter-terrorism authority within the shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  . 
the course will be attended by groups and special units from the armed forces of tajikistan ,  kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  russia and china . 
military aircraft ,  heavy armoured vehicles and various types of weapons and ammunition will be used ,  he commented . 
the main aim of the training is to strengthen the armed forces ability to tackle the so-called three forces of evil :  international terrorism ,  political extremism and separatism . 
the first large-scale training course run by the sco ,  which was entitled peace mission <num>2007</num>  , was held in august <num>2007</num>  in the chinese city of urumqi and ended in russia at the chebarkul training range near chelyabinsk . 
over <num>4,000</num>  soldiers from china ,  russia ,  kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan took part in strategic and operational exercises . 
the sco was the first regional organisation in the world to focus on the fight against terrorism . 
at the sco summit in <num>2006</num>  , the heads of member states of the organisation reaffirmed that the campaign against the three forces of evil was a security cooperation priority . 
in return ,  qatar aims to lock down a deal to secure some of the purchasing options on yields from the crops ,  giving the gulf state an opportunity to stake a claim on a reliable future food supply . 
already under severe inflationary pressure ,  qatar has seen price tags at supermarkets increase dramatically in recent months as global demand outstrips supply chains despite government initiatives to fix and control prices . 
inflation in qatar ,  the worlds largest exporter of liquefied natural gas ,  hit <num>13.7</num>  per cent in the fourth quarter <num>2007</num>  , just short of a record . 
last year ,  rents surged almost <num>28</num>  per cent . 
the uaes <num>4.5</num>  million population relies heavily on imported food ,  spending about <num>3</num>  €  billion annually on imports . 
under pressure from the government and consumers ,  a string of retailers - including french hypermarket giant carrefour - have agreed in recent weeks to fix the price of basic food items at <num>2007</num>  levels . 
last week ,  saudi arabias cabinet approved plans to increase saudi investments overseas in fisheries ,  livestock and food production . 
although there has been no official word on the likely locations for this investment ,  the subcontinent is a probable destination . 
nato allies pledge <num>5,000</num>  troops for afghanistan
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama addresses a news conference at the nato summit in strasbourg ,  april <num>4</num>  .
 ( reuters / jason reed ) 
strasbourg-nato allies in afghanistan will commit <num>5,000</num>  more troops to the fight against the taliban ,  white house spokesman robert gibbs said april <num>5</num>  .
around <num>3,000</num>  from allied and partner nations will provide security leading up to afghan elections later this year . 
the major contributors will be britain ,  providing <num>900</num>  troops ,  and germany and spain with <num>600</num>  troops each . 
between <num>1,400</num>  and <num>2,000</num>  soldiers will be deployed to staff <num>70</num>  embedded training teams to help build up the afghan national army to a force of <num>134,000</num>  .
a training team includes between <num>20</num>  and <num>40</num>  soldiers who will provide mentoring to afghan soldiers in the field . 
eleven countries are contributing to these teams . 
more than <num>400</num>  new paramilitary trainers and mentors will be training afghan national police ,  nato's first commitment to afghan police training . 
of those ,  <num>300</num>  will be french and <num>100</num>  will be italian . 
nato countries met in europe on april <num>3</num>  to discuss plans for the war against the taliban and al-qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan . 
this comes as nato's supreme allied command asked for <num>20,000</num>  additional troops to aid security ahead of the elections . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama has ordered the deployment of <num>17,000</num>  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  troops to fight the taliban in the south and the east and <num>4,000</num>  more to train afghan troops . 
dushanbe-tajikistan could play a central role in shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  efforts to help resolve the afghan issue . 
with its <num>1,300</num>  km long border with afghanistan ,  the longest common border with afghanistan among sco member countries ,  tajikistan is prepared to contribute its transport and communication abilities toward sco efforts to help the afghan government . 
this was discussed at an international conference titled the republic of tajikistan and the sco :  the situation and outlook ,  held in dushanbe on march <num>31</num>  .
the sco and nato ,  which hold similar positions on the afghan issue ,  must develop means of coordinating their efforts in order to work together toward their common goals . 
according to russias national coordinator in the sco akbarsho iskandarov ,  nato has been providing security in afghanistan for eight years ,  but that this task cant be accomplished without the help of the sco . 
economist rustam babadzhanov said sco members and observers should boost their economic presence in afghanistan . 
china has already begun developing the mining industry there ,  investing impressive financial and technological resources ;  tajikistan is building a highway ,  railway and power lines . 
analyst khaidar solekhov maintains that the investment projects proposed by the tajik government in transport ,  communications and energy should be supported since they are of regional importance . 
furthermore ,  dushanbe is proposing projects in agriculture and irrigation in the afghan provinces bordering tajikistan ,  specifically construction of the dashtizhdum hydroelectric plant that in addition to supplying electricity will irrigate about <num>2</num>  million hectares of afghan land . 
the conference participants emphasised the need for the sco to develop a unified approach in their dealings with afghanistan ,  particularly concerning the use of interstate rivers . 
khomid arifov ,  head of geophysical service at the tajik academy of sciences ,  argues that afghanistan should be given a quota for the use of water from the pyandzh and amudarya rivers ,  since they run across borders and about <num>30</num>  percent of their resources are formed on afghan territory . 
most experts believe sco participation in various projects in afghanistan will strengthen the countrys economic potential and help solve its social problems ,  encouraging afghans to shift their attentions from the war and drug production to peace-time development issues .

seventeen people ,  both military personnel and civilians ,  were wounded as a result of an explosion and fire at the largest ammunition warehouse there . 
the government tasked the commission to identify ways to achieve the proper level of security at such sites . 
afghan army provides medical care
prior notification to villages about scheduled medcaps cannot be made due to security and safety reasons . 
however ,  in afghanistan ,  word-of-mouth is very effective . 
the news about the medcap visit travelled like wildfire throughout the area ,  and within an hour ,  hundreds showed up to be treated . 
during this visit ,  close to <num>200</num>  men and over <num>100</num>  women and children were treated . 
the common themes were diarrhea ,  gastroenteritis  ( stomach ailments )  and vitamin deficiencies caused by poor nutrition . 
the high level of corruption among those in the upper echelons of power in tajikistan impedes economic development in this very poor central asian country .

he added that the tenges exchange rate against the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar will remain within <num>5</num>  tenge of <num>150</num>  tenge in the medium term . 
the president of the national bank also highlighted the favourable balance of payments in <num>2008</num>  owing to rises in exports and export prices as another encouraging factor in the economy . 
we saw a surplus of us$7 billion ,  or <num>5.3</num>  percent of gdp ,  in the current account of our balance of payments despite having had a deficit of more than seven percent of gdp in <num>2007</num>  , he noted .

but the investigation did identify the person believed to have ordered the hit as adam delimkhanov ,  a close associate and relative of chechnyas president ramzan kadyrov and the chechen representative in russias federal legislature .

 ( photo by afp / getty images ) 
according to the president ,  in recent years various websites have launched ill-intentioned campaigns against tajikistan . 
this unwelcome process is gathering strength . 
having begun against us in the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  the information war pursues a single aim ,  to reduce the role of an independent tajikistan in the international arena ,  discredit the tajik nation and ,  finally ,  to sow pessimism and a lack of belief in a bright future among our people ,  rahmon stated . 
saymuddin dustov ,  a political analyst and the owner of the leading independent tajik-language newspaper nigokh  ( view )  ,  agreed that an information war had been unleashed against tajikistan ,  largely in the russian internet zone ,  ru-net . 
an enormous amount of material against tajikistan and rahmon personally can be found on ru-net web sites . 
dustov emphasised that <num>2009</num>  is a pre-election year and the presidents address could be considered a warning about the need to maintain national unity . 
dustov believes ,  however ,  that there is no need to call upon tajikistans media to do this because in recent years they have shown growing concern when it comes to defending the national interest .

according to morozova ,  if tajik authorities locate radzhabov there will be no problem extraditing him ,  thanks to a bilateral treaty between russia and tajikistan and other international agreements . 
attacks in russia on migrant labourers from central asia and the caucuses have been a matter of growing concern over the last decade . 
recently an unidentified group attacked a moscow construction site april <num>20</num>  and assaulted <num>15</num>  ethnic tajiks and uzbeks who were working there .

the interest of kazakhstan ,  whose economy is expanding ,  lies in its wish to conquer new markets among the states of southern asia .

salimzoda noted ,  however ,  that <num>60</num>  percent of the losses incurred have already been recovered . 
according to sfmcca data ,  its <num>255</num>  audits in the first quarter of <num>2009</num>  uncovered losses in excess of us$3 . 6 million ,  but almost half that amount has already been recovered . 
it is noteworthy that of the <num>175</num>  corrupt acts sfmcca identified since the beginning of the year ,  <num>32</num>  involved bribery . 
only <num>14</num>  people have been fired as a result of the audits ,  however ,  while more than <num>400</num>  received disciplinary and administrative sanctions . 
during this last period ,  <num>70</num>  criminal cases involving <num>96</num>  people were investigated by the agency and subsequently sent to the republic's courts for examination .

such caches are a legacy of tajikistan's civil war between <num>1992</num>  and <num>1997</num>  .
the government and the united tajik opposition entered into a truce and laid down their weapons <num>12</num>  years ago . 
makhmadullo asadulloyev ,  head of the ministry of internal affairs  ( mia )  press office ,  however ,  noted that since the tajikistan president's <num>1994</num>  edict on the voluntary surrender and confiscation of firearms ,  ammunition and military equipment from the populace ,  internal affairs agencies alone have confiscated more than <num>31,000</num>  weapons . 
such efforts continue to this day . 
in the first three months of this year ,  almost <num>500</num>  more weapons were discovered ,  confiscated or voluntarily surrendered . 
asadulloyev noted that confiscation of weapons continues to be one of the main tasks of tajikistan law enforcement agencies . 
the osce office in dushanbe has provided a great deal of assistance destroying <num>34</num>  tons of confiscated weapons since <num>2005</num>  with a programme that will soon be completed . 
osce deputy security officer farhod abdurakhmanov said the organisation is now working on reaching a trilateral agreement among the mia ,  the ministry of defence and the osce on the destruction of explosives and ammunition now stored in mia warehouses and equipping additional warehouses for ammunition and weapons still being found . 
the total <num>2005</num> -<num>2009</num>  osce programme budget to reduce the number of weapons in tajikistan is nearly us$1 . 7 million .

on april <num>30</num>  , militants stepped up armed patrols in the district and abducted <num>15</num>  people including five policemen ,  a tax collector and a local government administrator . 
taliban fighters held the entrances to the valley but are now caught between security forces at their front and rear after the successful airdrop . 
residents saw troops rappel down ropes from helicopters outside daggar ,  the main town in buner ,  while firing and explosions were also heard intermittently . 
the military estimated some <num>500</num>  militants were in the buner valley and said that a few hundred terrorists holed up in the mountains never represented a real threat to the capital . 
meanwhile ,  in karachi ,  the economic capital of pakistan ,  <num>40</num>  people were killed and scores more injured during violence across the city . 
dozens of vehicles ,  shops and homes were set ablaze in the last <num>24</num>  hours . 
karachi is a sprawling city of some <num>14</num>  million and a melting pot of pakistans ethnic groups . 
concerns have grown recently ,  however ,  that radical islamists and taliban sympathizers have established an increasingly aggressive presence in outlying pashtun neighbourhoods . 
they have frequently clashed with supporters of the mqm ,  a secular ,  immigrant-based party that dominates many of the central urban neighbourhoods . 
the city is on high security alert ,  and additional security forces were deployed in the effected areas ,  a police official said . 
resolution to ensure stable transit of fuel passed at turkmenistan conference

they concurred on a proposal to request that the un commission an international group of experts to prepare a comprehensive document on those issues for their further consideration .

<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  peace corps volunteers in kyrgyzstan
in fact ,  the uspc volunteers were the first foreigners to enter the country in such numbers . 
according to kyrgyzstans ministry of education and science ,  collaboration between the ministry and the uspc officially began in <num>1994</num>  .
the first project focused on the teaching of english in schools and colleges . 
the extent of the outreach was considerable . 
uspc even worked in the countrys remote mountain regions two or three thousand metres above sea level . 
there was a lot we did not immediately take to . 
but to be fair ,  they did a great deal for the development of the pupils and helped them get to grips with english . 
a pilot fish farm has been opened with the support of the uspc in the issykkul region in the north east of the country . 
according to the regional administration ,  the project heralds a return to traditional methods of fish farming . 
the main aim ,  to regenerate fish cultivation ,  will help reduce levels of poverty among the local population . 
participating in the project are students and teachers from the colleges where the american volunteers work . 
it was unique in that it was the first time so many influential organisations had helped run such an event .

kyrgyzstan - there are approximately <num>10,000</num>  runaway children and <num>23,000</num>  child labourers in kyrgyzstan ,  the government has revealed based on research carried out by international organisations in kyrgyzstan .

in <num>2008</num>  , public opinion research centre el-pikir found that more than <num>25</num>  percent of runaways left home because of poverty and hunger ;  <num>17</num>  percent because of their parents drug or alcohol dependencies ;  and <num>23</num>  percent because of psychological or physical abuse .

the average ages of street children are between seven and ten years old . 
more than <num>78</num>  percent of the children surveyed said that they were unhappy away from home .

buses remain the main form of transport for the citizens of central asia . 
according to uzbekistans office of road traffic safety ,  a mercedes-benz passenger bus carrying <num>50</num>  passengers travelling from tashkent to termez crashed at full speed into an excavator that had been left on the road unsupervised without displaying appropriate hazard markings .

in view of the fact that the judicial process took place behind closed doors ,  it is not known for certain on behalf of which country or organisation the espionage was alleged to have been conducted . 
even kyrgyzstan embassy representatives in dushanbe were not allowed into the court room . 
the officers relatives believe that he was incarcerated for a lack of restraint in his assessments of events taking place in tajikistan . 
his daughter stated that her father had not admitted to the charges filed against him and that he told the court they were fabricated . 
she said her father ,  with whom she was able to have a brief meeting ,  asked her to convey to kyrgyz authorities his request to be extradited ,  as he is certain that in gaol in tajikistan he will simply be  " removed "  . 
official bishkek has not yet reacted in any way to the conviction of its citizen .

 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ) 
kazakhstan - as part of the corruption-free schools campaign ,  the prosecutor generals  ( pg )  office in the saryagash district of south kazakhstan region suggested protecting teachers from extortion by school administrators by crediting their salaries electronically to their bank accounts . 
over the past two years ,  law-enforcement agencies have been flooded with complaints from teachers and parents of extortion ,  theft and misappropriation of funds for teacher salaries ,  repairs and other school functions . 
the violations were confirmed in an anonymous survey of <num>1,120</num>  teachers in rural schools . 
sixty percent of those surveyed said they hoped that if salaries are credited electronically to their bank accounts ,  unapproved so-called voluntary deductions from teachers salaries for various school functions will drop . 
unfortunately ,  there are only <num>15</num>  atms in the six villages of saryagash region . 
other villages ,  some home to more than <num>100,000</num>  people ,  have no atm . 
another measure the pgs office has suggested to curb corruption is reducing the number of financial audits of schools . 
the regional prosecutors office said more than <num>400</num>  audits are conducted across the <num>140</num>  schools in the district each year . 
the pgs office said the overall solution to the corruption in education problem is to create a centralised accounting office in the regional education department . 
this will make it possible to audit all schools in the district simultaneously and pay teachers electronically by transmitting salaries directly to their bank accounts .

on may <num>11</num>  , police in varna ,  bulgaria arrested russian citizen and member of turkmenistans republican party kakadzhan atayev . 
according to atayevs associates and relatives ,  bulgarian authorities said they have no charges against atayav . 
in the next few days ,  however ,  a court in varna will hold extradition hearings in accordance with an outstanding <num>2005</num>  request from turkmenistans prosecutor generals office . 
atayevs associates fear that ,  if extradited ,  atayev will be subject to torture and other human rights violations in turkmenistan . 
there is ,  however ,  a string of criminal charges against him in turkmenistan dating back to the beginning of the decade . 
atayevs relatives claim the charges stem from atayevs public support of the opposition activities of turkmenistan's former foreign minister boris shikhmuradov who was accused of plotting a coup against and an attempt on the life of then-president saparmurat niyazov . 
atayev's allies say that he visited eu countries on a number of occasions since <num>2005</num>  , and that the russian prosecutor general's office even issued him papers stating that turkmen authorities have called off all criminal prosecution . 
looking to prevent atayev from being extradited ,  his relatives have turned to russian diplomats in bulgaria for help . 
talks held in uzbekistan over disputed fergana valley border
there are about <num>70</num>  sections along the uzbek-kyrgyz border that are disputed by both sides . 
talks were held in andizhan ,  uzbekistan on may <num>12</num>  between the governor of the dzhalal-abad region of kyrgyzstan ,  koshbai masirov ,  and local leader akhmedzhan usmanov . 
the situation in the village of chek ,  a territory disputed by bishkek and tashkent ,  was among the key issues . 
the two exchanged notes and protests . 
although the officials discussed improving friendly ,  polite relations between residents of the border villages simplifying trade and economic relations ,  and respecting the rights of citizens of both countries ,  the situation in the village of chek ,  which has become a major bone of contention for the neighbouring countries ,  was the main topic on the agenda . 
the press service for the governor of the dzhalal-abad region said masirov suggested moving the border post further from chek until the international border is confirmed . 
it is unknown what measures uzbekistan will take in response . 
the border protection committee in uzbekistans national security service called the kyrgyz foreign ministrys note protesting operations by the uzbek intelligence service in the village a biased statement . 
uzbekistan considers chek to be part of its territory . 
on april <num>30</num>  , the kyrgyz foreign ministry sent uzbekistan a note of protest over actions by the uzbek law-enforcement agencies during a so-called counterterrorist operation that went beyond all international legal agreements . 
according to the kyrgyz foreign ministry ,  eye-witnesses said selective checks of documents and home searches were made only against kyrgyz citizens . 
the operation ,  said the ministry ,  was accompanied by insults and crude threats against kyrgyz citizens . 
the uzbek border department expressed surprise and assured their neighbours that during the operation in the village nobody was subjected to any insults or threats and all actions by the border guards and security officials were legal . 
the village of yangi-chek is located in uzbekistan in an area described by the intergovernmental commission on delimitation and demarcation as the uzbek-kyrgyz border .

interior ministry spokesman makhmadullo asadulloyev said the forces were deployed to the eastern regions to destroy the opium crop there . 
due to good weather ,  a large planting of opium poppy and cannabis group narcotics was found in badakhshan ,  afghanistan ,  he said . 
experts affirmed ,  however ,  that opium has never been grown in the rashta valley . 
according to unconfirmed reports ,  a group of armed militants was discovered in the remote rashta mountain gorges just days ago that could have come from afghanistan and pakistan . 
political analysts think the group may be controlled by mullo abdullo ,  a field commander of the tajik opposition in the civil war who controlled a region of the rashta valley at the time . 
he did not recognise the <num>1994</num>  cease fire agreement in tajikistan ,  and after the <num>1997</num>  peace treaty his fighters continued to destabilise the region . 
tajik government forces in <num>2000</num>  conducted an operation to neutralise his group ,  but abdullo and his closest associates fled to afghanistan where they fought for the taliban . 
a military operation against the taliban by the pakistani army may have forced the militants to return to their former camp in eastern tajikistan and lie in wait . 
there are reports that fleeing taliban are shaving their beards to blend in with the peaceful population and refugees in pakistan . 
tajik authorities are not disclosing the true nature of the operation in the rashta valley to prevent panic among people who are still getting over the horrors of the civil war . 
representatives of tajik power structures will only say that the situation in the rashta valley is under the close control of the tajik authorities .

between january and may of this year ,  the kyrgyzstan narcotics agency seized around <num>500</num>  kilogram  of illegal drugs . 
more than half was opium and heroin of afghan origin ,  valued by agency experts at more than us$4 million . 
analysts have noted a recent rise in young women acting as drug couriers . 
shipments generally pass through kyrgyzstan on their way to russia ,  and kyrgyz anti-narcotics specialists work closely with russian colleagues to halt smuggling operations . 
the kyrgyz clothing industry moves from dim image
whether it is winter or summer people in kyrgyzstan ,  like the rest of the world ,  have to think about fashion . 
the kyrgyz people ,  according to official claims ,  managed to make enough progress in the clothing industry that now people seemingly dont think just about what to wear but also how to wear it . 
elmira jlobovich ,  a small private sewing enterprise manager ,  shared her thoughts on the kinds of problems her business now faces . 
she says that it would be good if the government helped the sewing industry to get its products to the russian market in a faster and smoother way . 
in general ,  the industrial sector from january through april of <num>2008</num>  has reported that issykkol ,  talas ,  chui and osh oblasts have seen an increase in production ,  while batken ,  naryn and jalalabat oblasts showed a decrease . 
elmira adds that the patent produced by the government two years ago allowed most of the underground workshops to become legitimate . 
salima kupesheva admits that the different workshops may produce products of different qualities ,  but there is a practice of putting foreign labels on local goods . 
the sewing industry is also a part of the support programme of the eurasian foundation for people with lower incomes . 
in general ,  people seem enthusiastic about the clothing industry . 
students at the diplomatic academy sponsored a fashion show with the sewing enterprise ,  which showed part of the line produced by elmira jlobovas small business . 
the show highlighted other festivities during the spring festival at the japanese centre in bishkek . 
raising cattle provides a significant boost to the incomes of families that have them .

parliamentarian makhkam makhmudov said the law was needed to bring the city up to international sanitation and epidemiological standards . 
the ban does not apply to dogs ,  cats and pet birds such as parrots and canaries ,  provided the owners obtain permission from the veterinary services ,  he said . 
cattle can now be kept for sale and be purchased in specially designated locations chosen by the city government . 
speaker of the upper house and dushanbe mayor makhmadsiad ubaidulloyev said the capital is no longer a place to raise cattle but noted that the number of cattle kept by dushanbe residents is double that in some of the countrys farming regions . 
several years ago ubaidulloyev banned the grazing of cattle and sheep in the capital ,  contending that the animals dirtied the streets and carried infections . 
dushanbe residents ,  mainly those who own their own homes ,  continued to graze cattle on their lawns and along roadsides despite the ban . 
the agriculture ministry said about <num>6,000</num>  head of cattle and <num>3,000</num>  sheep and goats are raised at homes of dushanbe residents . 
the owners of livestock are very upset by the amendments to the law since the animals are a source of survival for many of them . 
dushanbe resident makhfirat gets milk ,  eggs ,  and meat for her family from her two cows and several dozen chickens and sells the excess on the market ,  providing her a small steady income . 
she believes passing such a law during a time of economic crisis was ill-advised . 
the rivers sources are in china ,  and it is called the black irtysh until it flows into lake zaisan in kazakhstan .

astana - pavlodars ecologists believe that kazakhstans fishing industry and its entire agricultural sector are suffering because of a lack of water and the minimal overflow this year from the river irtysh ,  one of the largest rivers on the continent . 
the rivers sources are in china ,  and it is called the black irtysh until it flows into lake zaisan in kazakhstan . 
several years ago ,  however ,  china built the black irtysh-karamai irrigation canal ,  which is more than <num>300</num>  km long and will take up as much as <num>40</num>  percent of the black irtyshs annual flow . 
since ancient times ,  the irtysh has been the main transport thoroughfare connecting kazakhstan and siberia . 
it currently carries caravans of ships with wood ,  oil ,  grain ,  construction materials and other cargo ,  though the siphoning of the river risks making it unnavigable . 
unfortunately ,  no solution to the problem has been yet been found . 
kazakh ecologists contend china ,  whose economy badly needs water resources ,  has not yet taken a constructive position . 
they see several avenues for bilateral cooperation on the issue ,  however . 
they believe that both sides must inventory their water resources including surface ,  underground and frozen . 
second ,  they must join forces in creating a regional cross-border system for water preservation and use that also takes into account the storage and use of precipitation ,  temporary waterflows ,  desalinated water from salt lakes and other water sources . 
finally ,  the two countries will have to commit their scientific and technological potential to solving the problem .

tabriz - the strongest challenger to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad attracted an unusually large and exuberant crowd of supporters on may <num>25</num>  for a campaign speech in the north-west city of tabriz near the candidates birthplace . 
moussavis appearance was the first stop in a two-day campaign tour of north-western iran ,  and part of his effort to attract the votes of <num>15</num>  million turkish speakers around the country who make up nearly a third of eligible voters . 
people of tabriz and azerbaijan have changed the fate of this country several times ,  moussavi said ,  referring to several historic revolts against the central government in the region . 
they have always resisted dictatorship . 
all three challengers to ahmadinejad contend that his efforts to help the poor are little more than charity and vote buying . 
they have accused him of handing out loans and money instead of investing in major development projects that would create jobs and income .

for the first time in several years ,  bumper harvests provided pakistan and india with grain surpluses . 
karachi - pakistan exports increased us$2 . 61 billion in the first <num>10</num>  months of the current financial year because of the devaluation of the rupee against the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar . 
calculated in <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollars ,  the value of pakistans exports declined by <num>3</num>  percent between july <num>2008</num>  and april <num>2009</num>  , but in pakistani currency exports showed a substantial growth of <num>22</num>  percent as the dollar-rupee exchange rate rose from rs62 to rs80 at the start of this fiscal year . 
chairman of the all pakistan textile mills association in punjab akbar sheikh said ,  pakistani exporters of textile ,  rice ,  leather ,  sporting goods ,  and surgical supplies were the main beneficiaries of the depreciation of rupee in this financial year . 
devaluation provided great support to exporters at a time when the domestic and global economies were experiencing slowdown . 
it gave them a distinct edge over competitors in the international market by allowing them to offer their products at competitive prices .

srinagar - understanding the power of reading ,  the pakistani national book foundation  ( nbf )  is now setting up book clubs in remote villages and tribal areas to encourage reading ,  especially among the younger generation throughout the country . 
the goal is to check the decline of reading habits that has resulted from media technology becoming more available in the country . 
these clubs wont cost much as we are going to set them up in the homes of teachers or prominent members of a village community ,  who already might possess a collection of books ,  said nbf managing director mazhar-ul-islam . 
books of history ,  science ,  politics and literature ,  including biographies of renowned literary figures and a broad range of other subjects will be made available  [ to the clubs ]  ,  islam said .

critics charge misuse of aids prevention funds in kyrgyzstan

but international organisations familiar with kyrgyzstan's hiv situation estimate that the real number is much greater . 
 " treating one person infected with hiv costs between us$200 and <num>1000</num>  $  a year "  ,  says valery chernyavsky ,  director of the global foundation for combating hiv ,  tuberculosis and malaria . 
because the government cannot cover that cost ,  it has called on the foundation for assistance . 
he revealed that kyrgyzstan has received us$22 million in aid to fight the disease since the foundation began its work in <num>2003</num>  and that over the next five years kyrgyzstan will allocate <num>45</num>  $  million to hiv / aids treatment . 
in april ,  deputy prime minister uktomkhan abdullayeva issued a stinging criticism of the country's health ministry for failing to stem growing hiv infection rates . 
 " the money from international donor organisations has been squandered ,  while every year the number of hiv-infected people in kyrgyzstan increases . 
in my opinion ,  the clean needles programme has not justified expectations "  ,  she said .

according to zamira akbagysheva ,  the director of the women's congress of kyrgyzstan ,  international organisations have focused hiv-prevention efforts exclusively on distributing needles ,  condoms and food ,  which she believes actually increases the number of at-risk youth in the country . 
kyrgyzstan's health ministry considers accusations about the misuse of funds to be without merit ,  declaring that the country's epidemiological situation-though not without occasional problems-is completely under control .

dushanbe - on may <num>29</num>  , representatives of tajikistans law enforcement bodies ,  courts ,  international organisations and journalists witnessed the incineration of more than a tonne of illegal drugs in the furnace of a dushanbe factory . 
the public relations event marked the tenth anniversary of the founding of the countrys narcotics control agency  ( nca )  . 
the incinerated drugs ,  <num>122</num>  kilograms of heroin ,  <num>402</num>  kilograms of partially processed opium bricks and <num>597</num>  kilograms of cannabis ,  provided evidence in <num>98</num>  criminal cases and were no longer needed after court sentencing . 
 " instead of seeing a tapering-off on the supply side ,  we are seeing a consistent year-on-year increase ,  a result of the war in afghanistan "  ,  observed james callahan ,  the regional representative of the un office on drugs and crime . 
 " the links between narcotics and extremism and terrorism are well-documented ;  drugs are the life-blood of these movements . 
 "  un figures show that afghanistan harvested a bumper crop of opium poppy in <num>2008</num>  , despite a <num>20</num>  percent drop in land under cultivation . 
 " last year's harvest was only down six percent from <num>2007</num>  , when <num>7.7</num>  tonnes of opium were produced "  ,  callahan noted .

tehran - mir hossein mousavi ,  a moderate politician who is considered the strongest challenger to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ,  accused him on live television june <num>3</num>  of undermining the national interest by constantly questioning the holocaust and engaging in an adventurist foreign policy . 
ahmadinejad ,  who opened the debate ,  presented himself as a lonely incumbent who was being challenged by a powerful circle of leaders eager to bring him down . 
he added that two former presidents ,  ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani and mohammad khatami ,  were supporting mousavi to end his tenure . 
he suggested that some leaders who opposed his policies had indulged in inappropriately lavish lifestyles . 
ahmadinejads remarks suggested a deepening divide between the president and a number of influential leaders ,  including some conservatives who have been his supporters . 
the debate was expected to concentrate on the economy ,  but it devolved into a series of personal attacks . 
at one point ,  an angry ahmadinejad pulled out a photo of mousavis wife ,  zahra rahnavard ,  and accused her of having entered a graduate programme without taking the highly competitive entrance exam .

dushanbe-tajikistans industrial enterprises and general populace may be left without imported natural gas in the very near future . 
on june <num>10</num>  , uzbek gas distribution company uztransgaz notified tajiktransgaz management that it will suspend natural gas deliveries beginning june <num>15</num>  if an outstanding debt of us$18 million is not paid .

the kok aishyk art studio is a unique place in almaty . 
for <num>20</num>  years children have come here to learn the language of art and to create their first artistic masterpieces . 
parents who take their children to kok aishyk consider it a good mixture of entertainment for children and educational activity . 
for two years already my children have been attending this art studio . 
they want to come here ,  and we want our children to develop their artistic skills ,  said lyudmila the mother of two daughters . 
the studio is situated in one of the most important museums in almaty - the museum of arts named after abylkhan kasteev . 
kok aishyk director alena tolstyh says the location of the studio provides a great opportunity for children to see unique paintings and sculptures . 
parents agree with the studio director that the museum of arts is the best place for a childrens art studio . 
our studio is already <num>20</num>  years old . 
children attend the studio and  [ visit ]  the museum . 
during their lesson they can view any exhibition . 
there is always an opportunity to show examples of techniques ,  said lyudmila . 
the surrounding environment itself helps children take their creations more seriously . 
they understand that art is serious business ,  so they are trying to create something significant ,  she said . 
kok aishyk students are winners of many national and international artistic competitions . 
sometimes it is hard to tell the age of the author . 
when i first brought my daughter to the class ,  i saw paintings hanging on the wall . 
i realized that they have been done by children only when i saw the names and ages written on the pieces of paper attached to the lower part of the paintings ,  said one woman . 
every year <num>10</num>  to <num>15</num>  art studio students enter universities or other educational institutions with a specialization in art . 
olga kotseba is one of the famous art studio graduates . 
we are not aimed at making painters out of children . 
we just want them to become creative people . 
we want them to understand art . 
this is our main mission ,  tolstyh said . 
this year ,  city authorities have started renovations at the museum of arts ,  and the childrens studio has had to move to the kok tobe health facility temporarily .

during the investigation ,  police recovered the clothes aqeel wore during the attack . 
he used a fake identity card to rent a room ,  and later disappeared from the hostel after changing clothes . 
the owner of the hostel told police that aqeel took the room under the name of rana muhammad haneef and submitted an identity card with the same name . 
the mastermind of the attack took the others to a rented house located on a street in front of mansoora a day before the assault ,  and gave them weapons ,  rathore said . 
one of the accused told police he was taken to miran shah where he was trained in weapons . 
 [ taliban leaders ]  trained me for suicide bombing ,  he said . 
they came to lahore four days before the liberty incident .

islamabad - on june <num>27</num>  , plan international  ( pi )  launched its global advocacy campaign on eliminating corporal punishment in schools across the country . 
physical punishment hinders learning and can cause irreparable psychological damage ,  including a lack of confidence and self-esteem ,  according to pi . 
its campaign is aimed at preventing all forms of violence against children in schools ,  which includes corporal punishment ,  neglect ,  verbal abuse ,  emotional abuse ,  bullying ,  peer-to-peer violence ,  youth gangs and harassment on the journey to and from school . 
the campaign has been launched in <num>66</num>  countries worldwide by plan international . 
section <num>89</num>  of the pakistan penal code  ( ppc )  allows corporal punishment of children under <num>12</num>  , provided it does not inflict injury . 
cases of corporal punishment reported in schools ,  however ,  show that the law is being ignored and the so-called safeguards for children are not very effective . 
if arrested ,  however ,  abusers can be prosecuted under sections <num>323</num>  and <num>325</num>  of the ppc . 
the practice of corporal punishment is at <num>89</num>  percent in the areas researched and contrary to popular belief ,  it is practiced equally both in rural and urban settings ,  said plan pakistan  ( pp )  acting country director roger braden . 
our vision is of a world where children can go to school in safety and expect a quality learning experience without fear or threats of violence ,  said pp communications manager natasha kamal . 
the campaign is aimed at creating awareness among all stakeholders on the issue of violence against children ,  with a focus on corporal punishment . 
although the pp campaign is generally focused on public schools ,  members have gauged that in the madrasas severe forms of punishments like humiliating posture ,  rebukes and baton beatings have been reported ,  according to kamal . 
pp has been working in pakistan since <num>1997</num>  and has focus areas throughout the country ,  including the districts of chakwal ,  vehari in punjab ,  and the squatter settlements of islamabad .

the province shares a long border with pakistans northwest frontier province ,  and militants use the land to transit between the two countries and also as a base from which to plan and conduct attacks on afghan and coalition security forces
in nuristan there are lots of problems . 
the people do not have the most basic facilities of life ,  said the commander . 
but still were working here ,  and well be here to serve our country . 
one of the strengths of the ana is its multi-ethnic make-up . 
the small unit at kala gush has soldiers from nearly every province ,  says the commander . 
the training has gone well ,  say the soldiers ,  and they find strong support from the local population . 
we always strive for good relations with the local people ,  said mukhsein . 
we introduce ourselves to the communities and explain that we are here to work together with them for the good of our country . 
the ana has artillery units based in kunar ,  nuristan ,  kapisa ,  and a reserve unit in kabul . 
the cannons have a long range and can support operations directed by other allied units . 
in nuristan there are lots of challenges because of underdevelopment - no clinics ,  no roads ,  said mukhsein . 
but still were working here ,  and well stay here . 
our job is to serve our country .

tashkent - the first plant to produce synthetic fuel in the cis will be built in uzbekistan . 
an agreement for the joint venture was signed july <num>14</num>  by holding company uzbekneftegaz ,  malaysias petronas and south african company sasol group . 
uzbekistan is one of the top <num>10</num>  gas-producing countries in the world with annual production of about <num>60</num>  billion cubic metres . 
the plant to produce synthetic fuel from gas will fully cover domestic demand and make it possible to export fuel ,  project coordinator for uzbekistan aziz yusupkhodzhayev said .

dushanbe - the global environment facility ,  which has been implementing environmental protection projects in tajikistan for three years ,  will help the countrys government eliminate large quantities of hazardous industrial waste dumped during the soviet era ,  it was reported by facility ceo monique barbut . 
the dumping of toxic chemicals has led to a disastrous situation . 
they were originally used in pesticide and chemical products for agricultural purposes . 
the landfill sites now pose a danger to life and health . 
the situation is made even worse by the fact that the sites are now not even fenced off ,  and the government does not have resources for the safe storage of the waste . 
more than <num>30,000</num>  hectares of land were subjected to toxic and chemical pollution . 
the tajik government is now devising industrial waste elimination programmes that the global environment facility will fund . 
the tajik ministry of energy and industry  ( mei )  proposed to russia that the two countries establish a joint venture company to process uranium in the north of the country . 
deputy minister mahmadsharif hakdodov said that a number of proposals have been made to russia and the rosatom corporation in particular . 
one of the goals of this cooperation will be the decontamination of uranium tailings storage sites . 
all uranium processing works will be carried out in accordance with iaea regulations ,  since tajikistan is a member state of this international organisation and is complying with the obligations it has assumed ,  hakdodov underlined . 
investors have been reluctant to participate in tajikistans uranium sector over the last <num>17</num>  years due to a fall in the price of the metal . 
ecologists ,  however ,  do not object to the creation of a joint venture ,  provided that it complies with global environmental standards .

the court had delayed a decision on whether to accept his confession and guilty plea ,  with prosecutors arguing that his statement was incomplete and accusing kasab of seeking to avoid the death penalty . 
tensions over the past few weeks between kasab and his attorney ,  abbas kazmi ,  remained high ,  with the lawyer asking to be excused from the case after the morning session ,  saying his client had no faith in him . 
 " if he has no confidence in me ,  there is no sense in me continuing in the case ,  "  he said .

airwaves help fill education gap
badghis radio has teamed with the afghan government and international agencies to support female literacy and health education . 
the ministry of information ,  culture and tourism along with the ministry of womens affairs are using radio to reach women living in remote areas of the province . 
last year ,  the international organization for migration  ( iom )  and the non- governmental organization  ( ngo )  internews carried out an assessment to upgrade badghis provinces only radio station . 
the upgrade has provided the station with the technical requirements needed to broaden the stations coverage outside of the provincial capital of qala-e naw . 
since january <num>2007</num>  , iom has partnered with the spanish agency of international cooperation to implement a womens literacy campaign . 
according to unicef ,  literacy rates for women in afghanistan are just <num>14</num>  percent ;  in remote provinces such as badghis ,  this figure is even smaller . 
habibullah haqbin ,  secretary for badghis local radio ,  said ,  radio has been the most effective way to reach people in the province and we thank the agencies that are working to provide us with educational programming . 
in nearby herat province ,  iom recently provided vital radio equipment such as an fm transmitter ,  amplifier and speakers to radio sahar . 
the station ,  located in herat city ,  has <num>600,000</num>  listeners and offers a variety of educational programming . 
tanin is a joint initiative between internews and aina . 
over <num>35</num>  radio stations in <num>25</num>  provinces ,  including badghis ,  are being provided with programming .

due to its extensive reserves of raw material ,  the purchase of pakistani cement has become the prime of choice of international buyers all over the world . 
the growth in demand for cement in asia ,  the middle east ,  and africa has greatly increased export opportunities for the country . 
pakistan now ranks fifth among concrete exporting nations ,  according to the global cement analytical report with a jump of <num>47</num>  percent during the last fiscal year ,  according to the all-pakistan cement manufacturers association . 
china ranks first with <num>26</num>  million tonnes ,  japan second with <num>12</num>  , thailand third also with around <num>12</num>  , followed by turkey with <num>10.6</num>  million tonnes . 
the new markets explored by the exporters include some african countries ,  qatar and iraq ,  he said . 
pakistan could  [ reach ]  <num>13</num>  to <num>14</num>  million tonnes by the end of this fiscal year next june if the government provides better infrastructure facilities . 
overall concrete production in pakistan may have witnessed seven percent growth in july ,  said analyst muhammad rehan . 
the growth is attributable to rising export volumes ,  as domestic demand remains depressed . 
rehan also said that pakistans lead over many european nations is being supported by closures of cement factories across the continent due to the passage of new pollution control and other environmental protection laws .

karachi - for the first time ,  leather exports and associated products from pakistan have dropped below us$1 billion because of the global and domestic recession ,  exporters said on <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>6</num>  .
in <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  , leather exports earned only <num>970</num>  $  million as opposed to <num>1.23</num>  $  billion a year earlier ,  the chairman of the pakistan tanners association ,  saddain ahmed ,  said . 
the sector suffered a major setback as a result of a <num>25</num>  percent drop in international demand . 
the leather industry has been facing a crisis for the past two years because of the political  [ situation ]  ,  terrorism and the energy crisis in the country ,  naeem javed ,  ceo of sublime exports ,  said . 
between <num>2008</num>  and <num>2009</num>  , the crisis deepened with the financial crunch and an economic meltdown in developed countries that further damaged exports in the leather industry . 
two years ago ,  raw leather ,  leather garments ,  gloves ,  footwear and leather accessories for cars and motorbikes fetched <num>1.5</num>  $  billion .

privatisation of state property promotes increase in gdp
the tajkhimprom enterprise
the government of tajikistan has initiated the third stage of a strategic plan to privatise and restructure state monopolies . 
according to nozimov ,  of the <num>10,800</num>  small ,  medium ,  and large businesses subject to privatisation ,  <num>95</num>  percent have already become private . 
the privatisation of enterprises is proceeding successfully mainly in the spheres of transportation ,  services ,  and trade . 
as of today ,  only <num>68</num>  percent of the total number of privatised state concerns are functioning . 
for various reasons ,  but particularly because of a lack of circulating capital ,  the rest are standing idle . 
this applies especially to medium and large-sized industrial enterprises . 
in the opinion of independent economist iles yunusov ,  the state must take steps to create conditions in which all privatised businesses start working at full capacity and bring in revenue for the state in the form of taxes . 
with respect to those businesses that are not functioning ,  it is necessary to activate tax levers ,  in particular ,  taxes on property and land ,  so that private owners will have incentives to set up production more quickly . 
according to data from the state committee for investments and state property ,  beginning in <num>2004</num>  the privatisation of medium-sized and large industrial enterprises has been done on a tender basis . 
moreover ,  last year ,  international audits were conducted on the activity of the department for state property for the period <num>2005</num> -<num>2006</num>  , as well as for the first quarter of <num>2007</num>  .
the primary purpose of the audit was to meet the requirements of the international standard on privatisation of state property . 
the audit was conducted by the european companies pohl consulting  & amp ;  associates and ernst  & amp ;  young on orders from the world bank . 
based on the results of the audit ,  the world bank offered a positive assessment of the activity of the committee for investments and state property in tajikistan in the matter of the privatisation of state property for the period since sales began to be conducted by auction or tender . 
however ,  the world bank recommended that technical errors be corrected in the process of privatisation at the level of providing more information and placing advertisements for tenders . 
whereas previously information about auctions and tenders was disseminated in the mass media once a month ,  that information will now be available three times a month . 
nozimov emphasised that the privatisation of businesses on the basis of tenders is an efficient method . 
with this scheme ,  the private business man assumes a number of obligations which he must meet within two years from the time that a business is purchased . 
at the beginning of <num>2008</num>  , the large tajkhimprom industrial enterprise ,  which produces liquid chlorine and bleaching powder used for water treatment ,  was acquired by the british company miru mir limited on the basis of a tender . 
in accordance with the contract and the obligations that it assumed ,  the british company has set up production at the enterprise ,  which had been standing idle for several years . 
the tajik aluminium company  ( talco ) 
nozimov notes that this year ,  a start has been made on the strategic plan to re-construct the major state properties in the republic ,  which number <num>37</num>  .
according to figures from the state committee for investments and state property ,  the appropriate documents have been drawn up for the restructuring of the tajik aluminium company  ( talco )  ,  which is considered to be the flagship of tajik industry . 
however ,  a final decision on the matter will be made by the government of the republic .

karachi - pakistani banks reported that deposits during the first quarter of the <num>2009</num>  calendar year increased by us$927 million ,  as the economy moves towards recovery ,  state bank of pakistan spokesman syed wasimuddin said <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
deposits at commercial banks totaled <num>46.67</num>  $  billion by march ,  up from <num>45.79</num>  $  billion in december ,  he added . 
over the same period ,  islamic bank deposits rose to <num>2.48</num>  $  billion from <num>2.43</num>  $  billion ,  wasimuddin noted . 
commercial banks also had growth in deposits and assets ,  and also earned an impressive profit in <num>2008</num>  to <num>2009</num>  , bank alfalah ceo sirajuddin aziz said . 
pakistani commercial banks have shown resilience and a strong potential for growth . 
commercial banks are focusing this year on consolidation of their existing business because of the recession ,  but in <num>2010</num>  the banks could start aggressive marketing as the economy of the country continues to move towards recovery and growth ,  he added . 
the islamic banking industry experienced growth  [ in its ]  outreach programme ,  and its branch network had increased to <num>522</num>  offices by march ,  said hasan raza ,  executive vice-president of meezan bank ,  pakistans largest islamic bank . 
the growth of deposits and assets of islamic banks between january and march ,  however ,  fell below expectations due to the global financial crisis ,  raza said . 
but between april and december ,  the islamic banking sector may experience the momentum needed to achieve their expected targets ,  with the help of support from the imf and other donors ,  he added . 
credit cards in uzbekistan :  a blessing or a bane ? 
mandatory payment terminals are installed in places with abundant cash flow . 
 ( photo by tim boyle / getty images ) 
tashkent - new trade and service regulations went into effect in uzbekistan on <abbr>aug.</abbr> 
<num>6</num>  that require companies in those sectors to conduct transactions primarily through credit cards . 
to comply ,  they will have to purchase <num>12,500</num>  payment terminals before the end of the year ,  which will raise their number in the country to approximately <num>40,000</num>  .
in fact ,  uzbek currency is fast losing its value . 
according to yuldashev ,  the inflation rate in the country is more than <num>20</num>  percent ,  while official media assert that it does not exceed eight percent . 
furthermore ,  in the first six months of the year ,  the numerical value of personal deposits in bank accounts increased by <num>80</num>  percent ,  largely due to inflation . 
as of july <num>1</num>  , that sum reached approximately us$1 . 5 billion ,  depending on the exchange rate declared by the uzbek bank . 
experts hope that the installation of payment terminals will not only eliminate the need for people to carry kilos of cash when they go shopping ,  but also cut back on the overall number of cash transactions . 
at present ,  it is unclear what the value of the national currency in uzbekistan really is . 
local financial experts hope that credit cards transactions ,  projected to reach <num>900</num>  billion sums by <num>2011</num>  , will ease the situation . 
the use of credit cards ,  however ,  increases the retail price of goods in uzbekistan by ten percent . 
whether or not credit cards are a blessing or a bane for uzbek consumers is therefore open to considerable debate . 
help for mountain regions in southern kyrgyzstan
one of the main thrusts of this help is comprehensive support for the kosh-araket / joint action programme . 
according to the project co-ordinator ,  erkingul karakozuyeva ,  the inhabitants of one quarter of the city of karasuu have obtained access to natural gas thanks to this programme . 
some of the other improvements include : 
plans in the village of mombekovo in zhalalabat district to carry out repairs on rural medical facilities . 
one of the areas in osh district severely affected by powerful mountain torrents
the main drive within the framework of the kosh-araket / joint action programme is towards supporting small projects that can be really useful and have a precise social impact . 
in past years the programme of co-operation with public initiatives under kosh / araket / joint action has been implementing projects in the field of public health ,  providing potable water ,  improving sanitation ,  environmental protection ,  and education . 
the total contribution for implementing the projects has been more than <num>1</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  . 
this is three times what the local authorities have spent . 
the implementation of these projects has benefited ,  in general ,  more than <num>124,000</num>  people living in the southern areas of kyrgyzstan . 
one common feature of all these grant projects is the requirement that the person receiving the grant contribute <num>30</num>  percent of the sum requested . 
karakozuyeva emphasised that this was prompted by the local custom to not accept charity money . 
quite often the activity is carried out in places not reached by government bodies . 
one such example is the help provided for victims of the powerful mountain torrents that occurred in osh district . 
kosh / araket / joint action work is also being done on conflict resolution that includes solving problems and stimulating social processes . 
some <num>180</num>  people have been taking part in this unique project from among the local authorities and the scientific-production associations . 
today the programme is operating as an independent organisation . 
the project extends across the three countries that are located within the fergana valley ,  namely uzbekistan ,  tajikistan ,  and kyrgyzstan . 
agriculture sector to enjoy us$3 billion credit
karachi - the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  directed domestic banks to provide us$3 billion worth of credit to the agricultural sector for the <num>2009</num>  to <num>2010</num>  fiscal year ,  which began july <num>1</num>  , chief spokesman syed wasimuddin said . 
wasimuddin said the agriculture sector was the source of livelihood of at least <num>45</num>  percent of the total employed labour force in the country and contributes <num>22</num>  percent to the countrys gross domestic product . 
in <num>2008</num> -<num>2009</num>  , banks provided about <num>2.8</num>  $  billion worth of credit to the agriculture sector as opposed to the target of <num>3</num>  $  billion ,  zarai taraqiati bank limited  ( ztbl )  president zaka ashraf said . 
despite the economic slowdown in the country ,  the sbp has directed banks to extend credit to this amount . 
the agriculture sector has a strong potential to augment economic activity . 
if it has good access to credit ,  it can quickly enhance its overall production this year ,  ashraf added . 
raza implored the banks to revamp their agriculture lending mechanism by adopting innovative techniques to streamline agricultural financing ,  the statement added .

abdikarimov added that the patients are already feeling better and are now being treated on an outpatient basis . 
another six people who have been in contact with these patients are also under observation ,  but they have not been diagnosed with the virus . 
the chief medical officer said that the country has enough reserves of swine flu medicines to treat <num>8,000</num>  patients . 
he added that masked customs officials and border guards were working tirelessly at a local level to identify possible carriers of the virus . 
according to who statistics published at the beginning of august ,  the swine flu virus has claimed around <num>1,700</num>  lives worldwide . 
consequences of the energy crisis in kyrgyzstan
there is no country in the world that has been able to sidestep the rise in petrol prices . 
rising prices in the world market ,  particularly in the past two years ,  have resulted in an inevitable increase in the cost of transportation services in kyrgyzstan . 
the prices for inter-city buses have also increased . 
for example ,  whereas previously it used to cost <num>30</num>  som to go from bishkek to tokmak ,  now it costs <num>40</num>  som . 
and whereas ,  in bishkek ,  before the price of a trip increased ,  the cabbies went on strike demanding higher price rates because of the higher price of petrol ,  the cost of a journey to another city has now been increased without any fuss . 
the drivers simply pointed out that prices have sky-rocketed ,  and citizens just agreed to pay more . 
according to statistics the average wage does not exceed <num>5,000</num>  som a month ;  however it is possible to see various kinds of cars on the streets of kyrgyz cities . 
this gives rise to the thought that peoples lives run along two parallels-one open ,  the other hidden . 
in fact ,  you do not very often hear from people that they do not want to have a car . 
suicide bomber kills <num>22</num>  pakistani border guards
the bomber struck as the guards were sitting down at sunset to break their daily fast for the muslim holy month of ramadan . 
the guards were about to break their fast when a teenaged boy carrying a soft drink bottle walked towards them and blew himself up ,  said wakil khan ,  a witness at the torkham border crossing .

pakistans security forces have cleared most militants from the swat valley ,  northwest of islamabad ,  in an offensive since late april ,  and have also been attacking baitullah mehsuds men in the south waziristan region on the afghan border . 
earlier ,  two missiles believed to have been fired by a drone struck a militant hideout killing six fighters in south waziristan ,  including mehsud ,  intelligence officials said . 
hakimullah ,  who led militants in the khyber ,  orakzai and kurram ethnic pashtun tribal regions ,  has been chosen as the new overall commander of the pakistani taliban . 
pakistans prime minister yusuf raza gilani said the attack at torkham was a cowardly act and his government was determined to stamp out terrorism . 
the pakistani taliban are allied with the afghan taliban ,  but mehsud directed his attacks on pakistani security forces . 
some afghan taliban factions that have bases in pashtun lands on the pakistani side of the border have argued against attacks in pakistan ,  saying all fighters should concentrate on expelling western forces from afghanistan .

according to tradition ,  independence day will be most widely celebrated in tashkent ,  where city authorities are currently cleaning up the main streets and removing undesirable elements . 
the latter include the homeless ,  street children ,  people with ties to the political opposition and migrants workers not registered in tashkent . 
the detained homeless are being sent to reception centres ,  while street children are assigned to rehabilitation centres for migrant children . 
those who are unregistered and political have been advised to stay out of town during the period of celebration . 
humanitarian bike ride almost fell through

dushanbe - a bike ride from oslo to beijing by two european cyclists to help young people in tajikistan implement projects to generate sustainable incomes in the future almost fell through when one of the bicycles disappeared on the night of august <num>24</num>  in sukhcharv ,  a gorno-badakhshan autonomous district . 
an employee of the eurasia-central asia fund in tajikistan ,  ravshan abdulloyev ,  said one of the projects financed by the cyclists was being implemented there . 
however ,  other possessions belonging to richard salevic of sweden ,  including personal documents ,  a notebook computer and camera that were left unattended were not taken . 
they have already crossed <num>13</num>  european and asian countries and have raised more than us$17 , 000 for their projects . 
they donated the funds to the eurasia-central asia fund  ( ecaf )  ,  which will use the money to finance sewing and cooking classes for women from poor families with many children in the vakhdat region near dushanbe . 
a beekeeping project aiming to provide men with an alternative source of income will be implemented in sokhcharv . 
kyrgyzstan - a proposal by kyrgyzstans deputy prime minister uktomkhan abdullayeva to legalise the collection of funds in secondary schools ,  which already occurs unofficially ,  has drawn a negative response from ngos and the public . 
on august <num>19</num>  , at a meeting with secondary school headmasters ,  abdullayeva proposed that money be collected for use by the schools with the consent of parent committees . 
she also proposed that payments be made via banks so that the accumulation and use of funds can be monitored . 
in her view ,  the introduction of mandated collections in schools is a breach of the un convention on the rights of the child ,  which obliges kyrgyzstan to provide free and compulsory elementary education and encourages the development of different forms of secondary education . 
in kyrgyzstan ,  where a large percentage of the population lives below the poverty line ,  particularly in rural areas ,  even small collections in schools can severely strain family budgets . 
current unofficial admission fees ,  test fees ,  monthly payments ,  school uniform costs and collections to repair schools widen social gaps among students and results in a number of children at the bottom of the income scale not attending school . 
accordingly ,  the childrens rights defence league and the department for the protection of children in the kyrgyz government are implementing the initiative give my child a place in school in order to uncover violations of childrens rights at secondary schools . 
seven synchronized small bombs shook india's high-tech hub july <num>25</num>  , killing two people and wounding at least five others ,  officials said . 
bangalore police commissioner shankar bidri told the associated press the seven blasts went off within several minutes of each other at different spots across the city . 
one woman was killed in an explosion at a bus stand in the city's madiwala neighbourhood ,  he said . 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility . 
 " such incidents will not deter the government from pursuing its policy of dealing with terrorists in a resolute manner ,  "  patil said . 
television footage showed bomb squads scouring the areas with dogs . 
some of the sites were covered with shattered glass . 
an abortion in a state clinic costs between us$10 and <num>15</num>  $  .
 ( photo by stan tv ) 
kyrgyzstan - the kyrgyz government has issued new restrictions on conditions under which pregnancies can be terminated . 
they are part of a national strategy to protect reproductive health up to <num>2015</num>  .
under the new policy ,  abortions can be performed up to the 22nd week of pregnancy with the consent of both spouses or the woman ,  if she is unmarried . 
minors require approval from their parents or guardians . 
an abortion can be performed ,  however ,  only if one or more specific circumstances apply . 
these include the death or permanent diability of the husband during his wifes pregnancy ,  imprisonment of either spouse ,  termination of parental rights ,  pregnancy resulting from rape ,  having multiple children without a husband ,  or if the family already has a disabled child and is poor . 
human rights activists say new kyrgyz government restrictions violate the rights of women .

human rights organisations object to the restrictions claiming they violate a womans right to an abortion . 
it will only increase the number of illegal abortions . 
if a woman has decided to get an abortion ,  she will do so in one way or another ,  regardless of whether the reason is on the governments list ,  director of business and entrepreneurial women avazkan ormonova said . 
according to unofficial figures ,  an abortion at a state clinic costs between us$10 and <num>15</num>  $  .
private clinics charge more ,  between <num>20</num>  $  and <num>25</num>  $  .
specialists believe that the new resolution will probably trigger an increase in the cost of abortions . 
tashkent celebrates 2 , 200t anniversary

tashkent - tashkent ,  central asia's largest city and uzbekistan's capital ,  marked its 2 , 200t anniversary on <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
unesco's general assembly passed a resolution recognising the holiday as one of worldwide significance . 
to mark the occasion ,  a gala concert was held at the city's international convention centre ,  built especially for the anniversary . 
visitors from <num>60</num>  countries attended the festivities . 
the history lectures are vital ,  as most uzbeks have not yet forgotten the <num>1984</num>  celebrations of tashkent's 2 , 000t anniversary . 
playing on the confusing dates ,  jokes have been circulating about how life in the country ,  as on the frontlines in wartime ,  makes each year feel like ten . 
some suggest that such historical dates are dictated by modern necessity . 
with half the population living below the poverty line ,  entertaining displays of pomp have become absolutely essential to morale . 
nato to investigate airstrike in afghanistan
an airstrike in afghanistan targeted a fuel tanker hijacked by taliban insurgents . 
the second got stuck midstream ,  however ,  and the taliban informed villagers that they could have the diesel fuel the lorry was carrying ,  said a witness ,  mohammad daud . 
villagers rushed to the tanker to siphon off the fuel . 
they quickly gathered around the lorry with ten to <num>15</num>  taliban on top of it ,  when the air strikes hit . 
everybody around the fuel tanker died ,  he said . 
german defence minister franz josef jung ,  however ,  defended the action ,  saying that  " just <num>6</num>  km away from us ,  the taliban took two fuel tankers ,  posing a serious threat .  " 
german defence ministry state secretary thomas kossendey said the strike was aimed at preventing a taliban suicide attack against german troops . 
 " we can only assume that the hijacked tankers were going to be driven to the german army's camp to cause as much damage as possible in a suicide attack .  " 
while afghan president hamid karzai condemned the nato airstrike ,  he said he supported a shift in <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  military tactics in afghanistan ,  brought on by a recent review of strategy in afghanistan by <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  commander army general stanley mcchrystal . 
many foreign students studying at madrasas in pakistan ,  iran ,  and other countries are there illegally . 
tajiksitan - on september <num>1</num>  , the last group of deported tajik students who had been studying at islamic institutions in iran returned to dushanbe . 
davlat nazriyev ,  head of the information department of tajikistans ministry of foreign affairs said that in all ,  <num>20</num>  people were deported from iran in july and august ,  <num>12</num>  of whom were madrasa students . 
the deported individuals were in iran on expired visas and some had no passports . 
the ministry said they arrived in iran unofficially and were studying in religious schools without the appropriate permission from tajik authorities . 
this is not the first instance of tajiks studying at islamic institutions abroad being deported . 
a few years ago ,  more than <num>700</num>  individuals were deported from pakistan . 
mullodzhanov believes that some islamic universities are essentially turning into hotbeds of political extremism ,  not only in the near and middle east but in central asia as well . 
they have been criticised for insufficient screening of foreign students ,  many with a semi-legal or illegal status . 
mullodzhanov noted that local communities are also concerned about the influx of radically oriented foreign students ,  which may influence the domestic political situation . 
lunda bazaars help pakistanis manage their budgets
lahore - inflation and a struggling economy have forced many pakistanis to shop at second-hand bazaars to buy clothing and shoes with which to celebrate the eid holiday ,  marking the end of ramadan . 
they provide relief for the poor and those who have been hardest hit by inflation and the economic crisis . 
lunda refers to markets that sell goods at throwaway prices . 
before the lunda bazaar ,  it was impossible for me to buy new clothes for the children on my husbands meager income ,  said raheela ,  a housewife and mother of four . 
i cant even think of buying new things in this inflation ,  when it is even hard to keep the kitchen stocked . 
all kinds of second-hand clothing ,  accessories and household furnishings are available at deeply discounted prices ,  but the economy has even limited demand in this market . 
stall owners demand higher prices as they know we have no alternative ,  said one customer . 
the merchants say ,  however ,  that the poor economy has to be taken into consideration when pricing second-hand merchandise . 
we are also victims of inflation . 
monthly honorarium for blind cricketers

the raids are a measure of just how sensitive and damaging the claims of prisoner abuse have been for the iranian government . 
of all the charges leveled by the administration of president mahmoud ahmadinejad against opposition leaders since the election  ( including widespread electoral fraud and staging a coup detat )  ,  none have been as horrifying to iranians as the stories of abuse and torture of demonstrators that have trickled out from behind prison walls .

business climate thaws in central asia
one of the report's authors ,  svetlana bagaudinova ,  stated that  " the countries of eastern europe and central asia are ahead of other regions in the number of reforms undertaken to facilitate business procedures .  " 
this year ,  kyrgyzstan jumped <num>27</num>  places in the world rankings and was ranked the second most active reformer . 
according to neil gregory ,  advisor for financial and private sector development in the world bank group ,   " kyrgyzstan has shown for the second year running that it can make great strides in a broad range of indicators analysed in the report . 
 "  he points out that  " this year's ratings jump is the result of strong cooperation between the government ,  representatives of the private sector and donor organisations .  " 
lagging behind in 63rd place ,  kazakhstan only moved up one spot from last year's rank . 
bagaudinova noted however ,  that  " one of the country's significant reforms this year has been to improve the business climate by lowering tax burdens on private companies . 
 "  she also noted new streamlined procedures to obtain building permits ,  the repeal of installation fees for new connections to the electricity grid and a drop in the price of building site surveys . 
 " it's clear that the government has focused on improving the business climate ,  and reforms that are in the pipeline for next year will place kazakhstan in a higher ranking ,  "  bagaudinova said . 
in contrast ,  uzbekistan has fallen five places this year ,  while turkmenistan failed to make the cut and was not included in the rankings . 
kazakh independent cinema takes the crime world as its subject
kaysar kaiyrgali is kazakhstans youngest producer ,  actor and cameraman rolled into one
he recently released his first film bauyrym  ( kinsman )  . 
a film created by such a young amateur director with pretensions to box office success is a unique phenomenon in kazakhstan . 
the film ,  shown at the regional philharmonic hall ,  was open to anyone willing to pay <num>400</num>  tenge  ( <num>3.30</num>  $   [ usd ]  )  for a ticket . 
kaysar kaiyrgali and those of his friends with parts in the film  ( none of whom were over <num>19</num>  )  were there at the entrance to greet the audience . 
only the music was taken care of by professionals . 
the creators and actors in the new film are no older than <num>19</num> 
bauyrym has already been premiered in the first two ,  with the capital next in line . 
it took about a year to shoot bauyrym and cost its maker about <num>10,000</num>  $  .
those behind the film did not attract sponsors or consider selling the film distribution rights . 
kaiyrgalis parents and one of the actors involved in the film ,  dulat shayakhmetov ,  were responsible for financing the film . 
my resources are limited . 
his film producer colleague ,  azamat aynagulov ,  an actor with the regional theatre who is making a film about kazakh youth today ,  disagrees . 
his film ,  erten  ( tomorrow )  is now in the sound editing stage and will be completed shortly . 
my film is also about young people ,  but is not comparable with bauyrym if only because the characters are not based on any recognisable individuals from our own experience . 
you dont see young people armed with pistols and their heads full of bad intentions either in aktobe or ekibastuze or astana - or anywhere else in kazakhstan . 
i think you can admire the film-maker for his creative endeavour but not for the end result . 
nato ,  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  pleased by relations with uzbekistan

uzbekistan - director of the osce office for democratic institutions and human rights  ( odihr )  janez lenarcic said in tashkent on september <num>8</num>  that ,  our talks here have shown clearly a willingness on both sides to work together more closely in the future to strengthen uzbekistans compliance with its international commitments . 
human rights and the rule of law are not values the west is trying to enforce ,  but obligations that uzbekistan voluntarily assumed when it joined the osce ,  lenarcic said . 
lenarcic also said the osce was ready to send a mission to assess requirements in tashkent in the near future to determine the format of possible odihr involvement in observing parliamentary elections in uzbekistan scheduled for december . 
a day later ,  during an address on september <num>9</num>  to celebrate its independence day and the 2200t anniversary of tashkent ,  nato special representative for central asia and the caucasus robert simmons thanked uzbekistan for supporting nato peacekeeping efforts in afghanistan . 
he emphasised the countrys importance in the region in general and welcomed growing relations between nato and uzbekistan . 
the tragic june events in southern kyrgyzstan alarmed central asia and the global community . 
three days of widespread violence might have killed as many as <num>2,000</num>  and created <num>400,000</num>  refugees . 
several districts in osh and dzhalal-abad lie in ruins ,  according to official reports . 
the worst of the violence is over ,  but a humanitarian catastrophe looms as refugees languish in camps along the border and in uzbekistan . 
similar events struck the region <num>20</num>  years ago in june <num>1990</num>  , though on a smaller scale . 
soviet forces managed to stop the bloodshed . 
observers long warned of a possible repeat ,  particularly after aprils ouster of president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  a native of the south . 
the uzbek diaspora ,  which predominantly inhabits the souths largest cities and focuses on commerce ,  has historically done better economically than its rural kyrgyz counterparts . 
wealth ,  however ,  was not the main source of tension ;  politics was . 
kyrgyzstan has the worlds largest uzbek diaspora - more than <num>1</num>  meter  - constituting a fifth of the countrys population ,  according to some estimates . 
uzbek leaders in kyrgyzstan have repeatedly advocated cultural development . 
as a result ,  uzbek schools ,  universities ,  radio and television channels ,  cultural centres and theatres have opened in each of the souths large cities . 
the government also promoted local self-governance . 
periodic calls to establish uzbek as an official language have created tension ,  however . 
such worries informed the states efforts to promote cultural development through former president askar akayevs programme kyrgyzstan ,  our common home . 
the <num>2005</num>  tulip revolution led to a de-emphasis of such steps ,  with the government focusing instead on a composite nation and promoting the study of kyrgyz . 
the opposition ,  led by roza otunbayeva ,  took power april <num>7</num>  , after demonstrations and bloodshed . 
deposed president bakiyev ,  who had taken refuge in his hometown in dzhalal-abad oblast ,  attempted to restore the former government with his entourage on april 12th . 
however ,  in that showdown ,  the leaders of the uzbek diaspora sided with the interim government . 
bakiyevs supporters claimed that batyrov aroused uzbeks into burning down several houses belonging to the bakiyev family . 
but that confrontation ended before any ethnic rhetoric could take hold . 
many southern kyrgyz regard batyrov with suspicion ,  accusing him of favouring the elevation of uzbek to an official language and of urging uzbek political mobilisation . 
a crowd of young kyrgyz men marched april <num>19</num>  on peoples friendship university in dzhalal-abad ,  founded by batyrov ,  demanding an apology . 
the ensuing riot led to at least two deaths . 
the government promised to press criminal charges against batyrov for incitement of ethnic hatred . 
batyrov publicly apologised to the kyrgyz people before going into hiding . 
the south was primed to explode . 
not helping matters were the weakness of the interim government ,  numerous small-scale incidents ,  and the erosion of respect for the rule of law after two presidents' overthrows in five years . 
sources do not agree on the proximate cause of the june <num>11</num> -<num>14</num>  events . 
some say it was a confrontation between two groups of young people that escalated ;  others point to the alleged brutalisation of women from rural areas living in an all-female dormitory . 
however ,  the speed with which the violence spread has observers saying it was planned . 
ethnic uzbeks complain that men in uniform - soldiers and police - sided with ethnic kyrgyz rioters ,  while the interim government accuses bakiyev supporters of inflaming the conflict in order to discredit the government before the june <num>27</num>  referendum . 
yet another school of thought argues that religious radicals may have played a role . 
organisations such as the islamic movement of turkestan  ( formerly the islamic movement of uzbekistan )  and hizb ut-tahrir seek to build an islamic state in central asia . 
for them ,  kyrgyzstan in its disarray has become the weakest link of the region's five secular governments . 
thus ,  two communities ,  kyrgyz and uzbek ,  who lived side by side for generations may find themselves hostage to others' agendas . 
understanding this threat will enable the central asian governments to contain the crisis and to prevent a confrontation between kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan . 
the future of kyrgyzstan and the region depends on the ability of ordinary people not to succumb to the blandishments of those with ulterior motives .

kyrgyzstan to provide rural authorities internet access

the technical development of the project was entrusted to the state company kyrgyztelecom ,  which has a monopoly on internet services in kyrgyzstan . 
the company will create a fibre-optic internet access network by <num>2011</num>  , at a cost of us$21 million . 
the government intends to fund the project with donations from international financial institutions . 
to send documents by email we have to travel to the provincial administrative centre ,  because there are no local internet services . 
access to the internet will make our work much easier ,  said gulayim zhoroeva ,  an employee of the alay district administration . 
the internet project will be implemented at the same time as undps aiyil automated electronic rural governance software programme ,  adapted by the ministry of transport and communications ,  goes online . 
it has already been tested successfully by <num>14</num>  rural authorities .

kyrgyzstan - kyrgyzstans official statistics claim that there are less than <num>70,000</num>  child labourers in the country . 
the international labour organisation ,  however ,  estimates that more than <num>600,000</num>  children are forced to work in kyrgyzstan ,  <num>80</num>  percent of whom have jobs that are inappropriate for their age and development . 
according to the national statistics committee ,  kyrgyzstans population includes <num>1.5</num>  million children between the ages of five and <num>17</num>  , even though kyrgyz law forbids the employment of children under the age of <num>14</num>  .
child labour ,  however ,  is generally hidden ,  and official limits on the employment of children aged between <num>14</num>  and <num>17</num>  are frequently ignored . 
state labour inspectors say teenagers often work as assistants or apprentices in various specialisations . 
they do not have to be paid as their <num>10</num> - to <num>12</num> -hour work days are considered on-the-job training . 
this work is not childs play .

adults tend to think that its easier for children to work because they perceive it as a game . 
children are usually not paid for family labour even though they work as much or even more than adults ,  meerban head liliya ismanova says . 
i dont see anything wrong with this . 
instead of wandering the streets ,  let them help out ,  said moldokasym ,  a father of four . 
unfortunately ,  this type of family labour is acceptable in kyrgyzstan .

the international security assistance forces  ( isaf )  announced that the joint operation began with a raid in a settlement close to the village of torbakh-kash near kunduz . 
its objective was to identify taliban supporters and field commanders responsible for attacking afghan residents and facilitiating the flow of money ,  foreign militants and suicide bombers into the region . 
during the operation ,  some militants were killed and the rest captured . 
the extremists weapons arsenals ,  which included automatic weapons ,  grenade launchers and other types of arms ,  were also siezed . 
isaf reports those captured were militants and suicide bombers who crossed into afghanistan from neighbouring countries and back ,  and also travelled through the country . 
among the captured were two militants who are natives of the uzbek section of the ferghana valley . 
both admitted to being in kunduz province on the orders of takhir yuldashev ,  imus leader . 
extremists from pakistans tribal zones ,  areas that until recently were essentially beyond islamabads control ,  have infiltrated this region . 
pakistani authorities know that imu aggressively recruits reinforcements there . 
the imu has recently increased its activity in tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan . 
according to authorities ,  three imu insurgents who attacked members of the nation's muslim clergy were killed in a gun battle in tashkent at the end of august . 
in may ,  imu members calling themselves islamic jihad committed terrorist acts in the uzbek cities of khanabad and andijan . 
in june ,  nine extremists were killed and <num>15</num>  arrested in kyrgyzstan . 
in july ,  more than <num>30</num>  militants were neutralised in tajikistan .

kyrgyzstan - the autumn army draft has begun in kyrgyzstan . 
the defense ministry press service said on september <num>9</num>  that <num>3,000</num>  conscripts have begun service . 
the draft was met this year only after a new law was passed at the end of last year that reduced the term of service from two years to one . 
over <num>15,000</num>  conscripts have opted for alternative service ,  and those wishing to expedite their terms can pay a lump sum of us$272 to the state treasury . 
the army reform programme will help eliminate corruption and give thousands of young people who previously avoided the two-year requirement the opportunity to fulfill their civic duty . 
the defense ministry disagrees that paying for alternative service has resulted in a peasant army ,  and hopes that the reform will enable students to serve and improve the intellectual level of the army . 
an unlikely dream becomes reality
there is just one other female doctor in the province ,  but in the past there were none at all . 
that is partly why she first came to kunar in <num>1996</num>  .
my husband is from kunar and we wanted to be here . 
also ,  there were no professional doctors in kunar ,  especially not female ones ,  and the people needed help . 
i wanted to serve the people . 
by <num>1996</num>  , conditions in kunar were terrible . 
chaos reigned as mujahideen factions fought one another and thousands of people fled to pakistan . 
there were no proper doctors in kunar and the people really needed help ,  she said . 
so she and her husband moved there and got to work . 
when i came to kunar there was no female section in the hospital . 
it was so dangerous for me and for the patients . 
we made a female section . 
the head of the hospital was a mullah ,  not a professional man ,  spojmai explains . 
then she says ,  i worked for <num>3</num>  or <num>4</num>  hours during the day ,  and then patients came to my home . 
i worked regularly at the hospital ,  but the salary was very low . 
then the taliban came . 
it was so dangerous for the people ,  terrible . 
but the taliban also knew we need female doctors here ,  so they allowed me to stay . 
patients flocked to the hospital from every district of kunar . 
the taliban didnt allow people to come at night ,  but i came here to the hospital to give them prescriptions . 
more than <num>50</num>  women came each day seeking help ,  and she struggled to tend to them all . 
outside organisations offered much-needed assistance ,  but they faced their own challenges . 
ami  [ a french medical organisation ]  came in <num>1996</num>  and began supporting the health system with higher salaries and improved facilities . 
but after a year ,  the taliban arrested an expatriate staff member and ami pulled its programme from kunar . 
for kunar people its not possible for women to see a male doctor ,  so many women suffered at home alone instead ,  she said . 
the roads were also terrible ,  preventing many people from making the trip . 
conditions have improved drastically since those days . 
after the fall of the taliban ,  many organisations came to help and health care is now available in all districts . 
the ministry of health ,  kunars provincial reconstruction team and ami are all working together to advance the health care system in kunar . 
when i came here there was nothing for the people . 
im so happy that now we have professional doctors and good equipment . 
she continues ,  now i feel much better about the situation here . 
when i first came there was nothing ,  no equipment . 
now we have <num>23</num>  clinics throughout the districts ,  all with a female maternity care section . 
we have <num>2</num>  female doctors in asadabad ,  <num>6</num>  midwives ,  <num>3</num>  health workers and <num>2</num>  vaccinators - all female . 
its enough now . 
but one more female doctor would be good .

tajikistan treats drug addicts with methadone

gairat zaripov ,  director of the sogdiisk region ministry of health centre for the study and prevention of drug addiction ,  stated that <num>50</num>  drug addicts in khudzhand have already accepted free methadone treatment . 
zaripov noted that in many countries ,  methadone is given to drug addicts without charge as an alternative to heroin . 
the chemical does not cause euphoria ,  allows addicts to avoid heroin withdrawal symptoms and enables them to decrease their psychological dependence on heroin without causing physical dependence . 
the use of drugs in the treatment of addiction is controversial . 
defenders of methadone programmes say that the heroin alternative encourages drug addicts to enter rehabilitation centres ,  where doctors and social workers have the opportunity to work with them . 
for many ,  methadone replacement therapy is an effective way to manage drug addiction and avoid the catastrophic effects of illegal drug use . 
opponents of methadone replacement therapy ,  on the other hand ,  stress that the use of methadone is essentially the replacement of one drug with another ,  and does not solve the core problem of chemical dependency . 
the use of methadone in place of morphine was first proposed in <num>1955</num>  by the new york academy of medicine . 
it was first used for this purpose in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  in <num>1964</num>  , and since then has been widely adopted in many countries around the world . 
currently ,  methadone as a means for detoxification is a treatment employed in the united kingdom ,  thailand ,  china ,  norway ,  italy and the netherlands ,  as well as in some centres in australia ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  canada and other countries . 
residents of khenjan district in baghlan province feel their lives have been transformed thanks to over <num>30</num>  reconstruction projects . 
muhammad rahim who lives in the district said ,  in our village we have a primary school and high school as well as a new clinic . 
there are also a number of irrigation projects that have helped farmers in our area . 
a few years ago ,  we wondered if president karzai and the new government would be able to stay in power . 
they have helped bring security to our district and our lives have improved for the better ,  he said . 
armed groups in khenjan district have been one of the major causes of insecurity . 
according to shah ,  many families did not send their children to school or travel for fear of being robbed . 
but thanks to an effective local police force ,  these criminal groups have been disarmed . 
district governor mirza mohammad kamal credits the disbandment of illegal armed groups  ( diag )  programme for over <num>3,000</num>  weapons and ammunition being handed over and destroyed . 
the programme helped improve the overall security situation of the district . 
i can say with confidence that my district has no illegal arms ,  he said . 
district police chief major khawaja muhamamd hakim added ,  there is a main road in khenjan that people travelling from north to south often travel through . 
thousands pass through daily and it is important that it stays secure . 
more secure roads have helped increase opportunities for farmers and traders . 
khawaja also added that there has been a crack down on drugs smuggling in the district ,  and last year over <num>300</num>  kilos of narcotics were seized and destroyed . 
foreign workers have come in to help set up the power station . 
they are able to work peacefully without the worry of being attacked by armed groups ,  said khawaja . 
the afghan government and the donor community pledged to extend the diag programme another four years . 
the programme began in june <num>2005</num>  but an increase in the insurgency since then has posed great challenges . 
however ,  since the initiative began ,  over <num>100,000</num>  weapons and tons of ammunition have been collected . 
the programme is credited for disbanding <num>279</num>  illegal armed groups . 
pakistani and norwegian wedding dresses displayed in islamabad and oslo
pakistani wedding costumes were displayed at the norsk folk museum in oslo ,  javed said . 
the exhibition was scheduled to last for eight months ,  but was extended by popular demand . 
such cultural exchanges not only offer information about the traditions of other countries but also provide a form of entertainment ,  he said . 
 [ the exchange ]  promotes cultural understanding and provides an opportunity to compare the traditional values of both countries . 
the norwegian exhibition at the lvhm in islamabad comprises six mannequins in norwegian wedding dresses and one in a grooms suit ,  which looks much like a western tuxedo ,  complete with a large black hat . 
for instance the wedding dresses from kalash in pakistan and from the retlesklakh in east norway are almost identical .

the newspaper must pay the commercial bank ,  which came under state control at the beginning of the year ,  approximately us$400 , 000 under a <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
the bta bank lawsuit charged that an article respublika published in march critical of the bank caused clients to withdraw their deposits . 
we dont want to pay in cash ,  but in eurobonds that the bank has issued and is obliged to make payment on ,  the newspapers lawyer sergei utkin said . 
he added that defaulting on the bonds was not an option . 
the bank has not paid coupons on the bonds . 
editorial chairman at the newspaper irina petrushova said all disputes over the eurobonds ,  including those concerning the issue the newspaper wants to use as payment ,  fall under the jurisdiction of the uk . 
this gives us an opportunity to appeal bta bank actions in full ,  she said .

taliban claim responsibility for attack on <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  office in islamabad
police and security forces survey <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  wfp offices in islamabad after a suicide bomb attack on <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>5</num>  .
a few minutes later the attacker blew himself up near the reception desk . 
police say he had at least eight kilos of explosives strapped to his body . 
interior minister rehman malik says the taliban are taking revenge for offensives by government forces and the death of former taliban leader baitullah mehsud ,  who was killed by a missile fired from an unmanned drone aircraft . 
 " the operations we had carried out against them in swat ,  north waziristan and south waziristan have broken their back . 
they are like a wounded snake ,  "  he said . 
<num>4</num>  , however ,  the new leader of the pakistani taliban ,  hakimullah mehsud ,  released a video showing that he was alive despite information that he had been killed by rivals ,  and warned of thousands of casualties in further attacks . 
there are now fears of more attacks in pakistani cities ,  as the taliban launches a renewed campaign to defeat the government . 
senior al-qaeda bomb-maker killed in missile attack

it's not clear how much of the research bore results ,  though <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  authorities said masri did gas some dogs at the derunta training camp . 
western authorities said he provided hundreds of mujahidin with hands-on training in the use of poisons and explosives and distributed training manuals showing how to make chemical and biological weapons .

the blast sent a huge brown cloud of smoke skyward and shattered windows hundreds of yards away . 
nik mohammad ,  a <num>33</num> -year-old driver who was in the area when the bomb exploded ,  said the road shook violently and he saw at least four vehicles badly damaged . 
india ,  a longtime afghan ally ,  believed its political and cultural ties made it less of a target than many western powers . 
that confidence was shattered in july <num>2008</num>  when a massive attack on its embassy in kabul killed <num>58</num>  people ,  including two senior indian officials ,  and left <num>141</num>  injured . 
india subsequently fortified its afghan mission with high blast walls ,  heavy steel gates and a more circuitous entrance ,  alterations the government credited today with saving lives . 
the blast failed to breach the perimeter wall ,  although it did shatter windows and knock down doors in some of the embassy buildings .

parthasarathy ,  a former diplomat and now an analyst at the centre for policy research in new delhi ,  said it's too early to point fingers ,  but it's clear that the taliban sees indian economic assistance as complementary to western strategic objectives .

alternative crops allow farmers to give up poppy
farmers across northern afghanistan say government initiatives have successfully helped them give up growing illegal crops such as poppy and cannabis . 
anwar razaqyar ,  a government official in balkh province ,  said that poppy cultivation has dropped drastically . 
in <num>2006</num>  , the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  reported that balkh was one of the largest producers of opium in afghanistan . 
thanks to good security and a commitment to wiping out the drug ,  poppy cultivation in balkh is close to zero ,  he said . 
the ministry of counter narcotics set up campaigns to inform farmers of the societal harm caused by growing poppy . 
many community members voluntarily took part in the eradication campaign and went door to door talking to people ,  he said . 
thanks to alternative livelihood programmes ,  he was provided with seeds and fertilizer to help grow other legal crops . 
he is also volunteering some of his time to convince poppy farmers that they should give up growing the crop too . 
according to jowzjan governor joma khan hamdard ,  his province has also seen a drastic reduction in poppy cultivation . 
a strong commitment ,  good administrative staff and the peoples willingness to give up the crop has helped us in our success ,  he said . 
afghan interior minister zarar ahmad muqbul said while poppy cultivation continues in some parts of the country ,  in others it is successfully being eradicated . 
when reports come out that say there is record high poppy cultivation in afghanistan ,  this is mainly due to helmand province . 
the security situation is much worse there so it is more of a challenge to reach the same level of success there as we have in other provinces ,  he said . 
he also pledged to continue running eradication campaigns and providing alternative livelihood options to farmers . 
razaqyar said that local farmers have warned that the government must continue to supply fertilizer ,  seeds and equipment otherwise they will be forced to return to growing illegal crops . 
the government must continue to fulfil its promise to support farmers so they are aware of new farming methods and are provided with seeds to grow profitable legal crops ,  he said . 
the international donor community has pledged millions of dollars each year to help the afghan government fund eradication programmes .

a strong ,  modern ,  left-centre party has entered the arena as a counter to the ruling party ,  and provides a political alternative to the ruling authoritarian regimes idea of freedom and social justice ,  read a joint statement to the media . 
the parties reported that the national social democratic party has <num>140,000</num>  members ,  and the azat party approximately <num>87,000</num>  .
the presidential candidate they jointly sponsored in <num>2005</num>  second  election garnered more than <num>600,000</num>  votes ,  according to official election results . 
a representative of the company stated that uzbekenergo has informed the relevant authorities in kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan that it wishes to discuss changes to the terms for the transfer of electricity to kyrgyzstan across uzbek territory ,  but that uzbekistan will not withdraw from the integrated energy network ,  as previously claimed on <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
we wish to introduce a charge for the transfer of electricity to kyrgyzstan ,  which previously was considered to be cross-flow ,  and free of charge ,  the uzbek energy company explained . 
uzbekistans withdrawal from the integrated energy network would have had an adverse impact on neighbouring countries . 
tajikistan ,  for example ,  would have been deprived of electricity from turkmenistan during the winter ,  and would have been unable to export electricity to kazakhstan during the summer . 
additional strain would have been placed on the grids of the countries still in the network ,  as the network was designed to operate as a single entity . 
uzbekistans power stations account for almost half of the generating capacity of the integrated energy network ,  now that some of its thermal plants have begun using brown coal and new power lines have been erected in the fergana valley . 
the country therefore has little need of electricity from its neighbours . 
central asian traditions protected by unesco
bishkek celebrated navruz in march <num>2008</num>  .
the tradition of celebrating the muslim new year as navruz has been adopted by uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  azerbaijan ,  india ,  iran ,  pakistan and turkey . 
katta ashula chanting ,  which received the unesco asian pacific cultural centre prize in tokyo this year ,  for best example of the revival of an intangible cultural inheritance ,  was nominated by the uzbekistan national commission on unesco affairs for inclusion in the list . 
the unesco representative in tashkent announced that ,  after cultural inheritance activities are included in the list ,  the countries that nominated them for inclusion are eligible for financial aid from a special fund to maintain that cultural inheritance . 
the unesco list now contains <num>166</num>  activities in <num>76</num>  countries of the world . 
among them are the dance of tango ,  the art of azerbaijani ashygs ,  the art of chinese calligraphy and others . 
the cultural expanse of the boisun surkhandarya region of uzbekistan ,  the musical tradition of shashmakom ,  nominated by tajikistan jointly with uzbekistan ,  and the chanting of the akyns of kyrgyzstan are some of the cultural traditions of central asian countries included in unescos list . 
the committee concluded that despite evidence of support by local populations for these forms of cultural self-expression ,  the customs are under the threat of extinction . 
unesco representative in uzbekistan ,  jorge ivan espinal ,  stated that the goal of compiling the list is to draw public attention to intangible cultural heritage and to recognise its important role in humanity and promote its continued existence . 
the fifth session of the unesco committee of intangible cultural heritage will take place in kenya next year .

last year ,  afghanistan international bank  ( aib )  began a special loan programme for teachers in mazar-e sharif ,  the provincial capital of balkh . 
once a loan is approved ,  borrowers receive anywhere from five thousand to <num>100</num>  thousand afghani  ( afs )  - roughly equivalent to <num>100</num>  $  to <num>2000</num>  $   [ usd ]  ,  which they pay back in monthly instalments ,  said yadgar . 
shayma sharifi ,  a teacher from amir khesraw balkhi school in mazar-e sharif praises aibs initiatives to support local teachers . 
i own land but did not have enough money to begin building a house . 
i was able to take a loan of <num>30,000</num>  afs from the bank to begin building on my land ,  she said . 
kabir baryalay of the balkh education department said ,  not long ago ,  it was difficult to provide teachers with their wages . 
today they are not only receiving their wages ,  but are also able to borrow money . 
this has helped put teachers in a better position financially ,  able to provide more money to help their families and invest in things like land . 
ustad enayat ,  who teaches at bakhtar high school in mazar-e sharif ,  adds that the ability of banks to give loans demonstrates that the afghan government is becoming stronger . 
banks giving loans and teachers receiving their salaries on time shows the afghan governments new economic power . 
it gives me great pride to be a teacher and help educate the next generation of afghan leaders ,  he said . 
officials at aib say that if the bank scheme in mazar-e sharif goes well ,  they will begin providing loans throughout balkh province .

tajikistan to lease pastures in kyrgyzstan
tajikistan - the kyrgyz parliamentary committee for regional development and local self-government has approved an agreement to lease pastures to tajikistan . 
the agreement calls for kyrgyzstan to lease <num>17,800</num>  hectares of summer and fall pastures for the grazing of farm animals in a region bordering northern tajikistan . 
the effective price per head of sheep will by <num>3</num>  $  .
according to zoological norms ,  one hectare can sustain five sheep and one large-horned animal . 
the total lease price will therefore be us$267 , 000 he said . 
in order to prevent the introduction of disease carriers ,  tajikistan has assumed the responsibility of observing veterinary requirements while transporting livestock to kyrgyz territory . 
tajik pastures cover a mountainous territory of more than <num>3.6</num>  million hectares and are an important feeding base for livestock . 
leading scientific researcher of the tajik academy of sciences botanical institute abdullo madaminov ,  however ,  explained that improper use of pastures and fields in recent years has reduced productivity and increased land degradation . 
he believes that if the government does not pay attention to the problem of grazing lands ,  the result may soon be a significant shortfall in domestic meat and dairy production . 
tajik specialists note the importance of the agreement ,  particularly for the north of the country ,  where there are few pastures and fields . 
they are certain that leasing pastures on kyrgyz territory will allow tajikistan to maintain its current volume of meat and dairy production . 
there are no more than <num>20</num>  kilometer  of railroad in afghanistan .

the country has a railroad network built during the soviet era and it added a line continuing directly to afghanistan . 
according to expert tashpulat yuldashev ,  when the first american troop train passes through uzbek territory ,  the country will become the target of attacks by taliban insurgents and islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  members who cooperate with them . 
to counter this threat ,  uzbekistan will turn to cis states . 
uzbekistan had distanced itself from involvement in the collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  ,  but the country's military leadership recently expressed a desire to participate in its next collective rapid deployment force  ( crdf )  military training exercises . 
according to experts ,  uzbekistan will develop national security via more active cooperation with the shanghai cooperation organisation ,  which includes a regional anti-terrorism programme . 
power cuts affect accuracy of kyrgyz seismology forecasts

the tremor reminded local residents of the earthquakes of october <num>2008</num>  that destroyed the mountain village of nura . 
the tragedy claimed the lives of more than <num>80</num>  people ,  most of them children . 
almost all earthquakes occur late at night or in the early morning ,  before the electricity supply is switched on . 
power is cut off at night due to the state of the economy . 
the institute of seismology forecast that seismic activity this year would be mild . 
the situation will be different ,  however ,  in the south of the country ,  where earthquakes measuring up to <num>6.0</num>  on the richter scale could occur before the end of this year . 
opening up new land in tajikistan through irrigation
according to yarash pulodov ,  the general director of the tajik scientific research institute ,  the opening up of new land is also conditional upon an increase in the republics population . 
at this time ,  in the region there is <num>0.19</num>  of a hectare of land per person . 
in tajikistan ,  where the population is <num>7.2</num>  million ,  this indicator is almost halved ,  to <num>0.11</num>  of a hectare . 
over the past five years <num>10,000</num>  hectares have been opened up ,  and the area of irrigated land in tajikistan is now <num>730,000</num>  hectares . 
the programme to open up new land ,  and plans to improve the land melioration systems in the republic ,  are being actively supported . 
the president of the tajik academy of agricultural sciences ,  khukumatullo akhmadov ,  says that the state of irrigated land in the republic requires proper attention because of rising ground waters ,  the violation of agro-technical standards ,  and secondary salinisation . 
in order to correct the situation it is essential to improve land melioration systems ,  particularly in the north and the south of the country . 
according to figures from the ministry of land improvement and water economy ,  at present four projects are being implemented to open up and irrigate new land ,  improve melioration systems ,  provide irrigation for agriculture ,  and regulate water in the fergana valley . 
these projects are being realised using funding from banks abroad ,  such as the world bank ,  the asian development bank ,  the islamic development bank ,  and others . 
the total funding for the projects is <num>102</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  ,  including loans ,  grants ,  and the share borne by the government of tajikistan . 
the opportunity exists in tajikistan to open up and irrigate new land because the country has sufficiently large reserves of water resources . 
in fact ,  about <num>70</num>  percent of central asias water resources originate in tajikistan . 
tajik experts confirm that the intended plans to irrigate and open up new land can be implemented thanks to the building of new canals and water reservoirs that are monitored round the clock .

pakistani study reveals behavioural patterns of suicide bombers

in summary ,  the report contends that a human bomb is most likely to be a young man between the ages of <num>18</num>  and <num>25</num>  with a plump shape ,  as he is wearing an explosive pack under new clothes matched by new shoes . 
his hair and beard are likely to be trimmed ,  and he will often be fasting and reciting passages as he moves towards his target . 
the bomber may also be red-eyed from prolonged lack of sleep ,  and is unlikely to pay attention to anyone when approaching his target . 
the police distributed the report among district officers ,  security guards ,  watchmen ,  students and other organisations . 
we need a strategy to counter terrorism in these situations ,  imam said . 
we can execute that strategy successfully with the publics help . 
he urged citizens to cooperate with police in combating terrorism and said people should convey to police information on sensing any dubious activity or element . 
police are taking full advantage of the latest and most sophisticated technology ,  including surveillance ,  mobile forensic labs ,  criminal sketch software ,  criminal index cards software and networks for the prevention of serious crimes . 
the war against terrorism ,  however ,  can only be won with the help of every citizen . 
there is need to extend their cooperation with the police to ensure that such anti-state elements are removed from society .

the freedom of press index takes into account violations of freedom of speech in each country over the course of a year . 
just a few months before kazakhstan assumed chairmanship of the osce ,  the newspaper republic - business review was pulled from newsstands ,  and in august ,  the owner and editor-in-chief of almaty info ,  ramazan yesergepov ,  was sentenced to three years in prison . 
these events drew sharp criticism from international human rights organisations . 
we hope our report will help members of the osce and the secretary of that organisation gain influence in kazakhstan to make improvements in areas of human rights ,  and specifically in freedom of speech ,  vidal said . 
vidal says the authorities in uzbekistan will continue to pressure society . 
according to radio svoboda ,  six journalists were sent to prison this year on various charges . 
freedom of speech in turkmenistan has not improved in many years . 
muslim separatists blamed for blasts in china's far western xinjian region
the state-run xinhua news agency says the attackers drove a taxi to the local public security office and other sites and threw homemade explosives . 
the beijing olympic organising committee's wang wei repeated this accusation in comments to reporters . 
 " the attacks by eastern turkestan terrorists have never stopped in the xinjiang region ,  "  said wei . 
 " the very purpose of their attacks is all about separating the region from china ,  and such behaviour would not be tolerated by any country in the world .  " 
at the same time ,  wang says he believes the attackers are taking advantage of china being the focus of world attention because of the olympics . 
human rights groups say china is exaggerating the threat as an excuse to crackdown harder on uighurs . 
dru gladney ,  president of pomona college's pacific basin institute ,  says it is hard to say whether the attacks were coordinated . 
at the same time ,  he points out that although the attackers had prepared ,  they did not have high-tech weapons .

kazakh debate over adoption of roman alphabet continues
the kazakh alphabet has changed several times in the past century ,  from arabic to roman to cyrillic . 
 ( photo by dimitar dilkoff / afp / getty images ) 
astana - the first international kazakh press forum will be held under the patronage of the presidential fund for the development of the national language in early december . 
it will consider a possible transition from the use of the cyrillic alphabet to the roman alphabet . 
many views have already been expressed on this issue ,  which has both political and ideological ramifications . 
the debate over the choice of alphabet for the kazakh language is guaranteed to be heated . 
many kazakhs live in neighbouring countries ,  so we need to preserve a unity of information . 
we are now a nation of three alphabets :  cyrillic ,  which is dominant in mongolia ,  russia and kazakhstan ;  roman ,  which is used in uzbekistan and arabic ,  used by kazakhs in china . 
at least a third of kazakhstans population either speaks no kazakh ,  or has a poor knowledge of the language . 
experts fear the introduction of the roman alphabet will discourage non-kazakhs from studying the state language and may even provoke a new wave of emigration .

kyrgyzstan - a scandal has erupted in the kyrgyz parliament over the purchase of live ammunition by baktybek batyrbayev ,  the head of parliaments defence ,  security ,  law enforcement ,  judicial and legal reform office . 
batyrbayev is accused of violating the on government service law ,  but claims the scandal was fabricated and denies he obtained the live ammunition for personal use . 
until <num>2006</num>  , he was the presiding judge of kyrgyzstans military court and is an instructor in the criminal procedure and science department of the kyrgyz-russian slavic universitys school of law . 
the personal security of parliamentary staff members and deputies has become an issue of increasing concern .

the most recent murder took place last april ,  the same month several deputies proposed that they be granted the right to bear arms ,  a motion that was not supported by a majority in parliament .

according to afghan deputy minister of internal affairs makhmaddovud dovud ,  law enforcement agencies in both countries have conducted dozens of joint operations to arrest drug barons and raid heroin labs . 
more than <num>300</num>  such laboratories have been destroyed in the past four years . 
dovud states that afghanistan plans to increase cooperation with its northern neighbour in fighting criminal groups involved in the drug trade and training the country's law enforcement officers . 
the leadership in both countries have expressed their willingness to work together on these issues . 
despite the fact that afghanistan's northern provinces bordering tajikistan have not seen any new increases in opium poppy production ,  experts are concerned about information that large amounts of the drug have been stockpiled in the country over the last few years . 
foreign analysts have estimated the size of this hoard at around <num>10,000</num>  tonnes .

the new law also introduces the unprecedented penalty of up to five years imprisonment for disseminating unlawfully-obtained information about individuals private lives in the mass media . 
a french fairy tale on a turkmen stage
bastille day ,  celebrated each year in france ,  was commemorated in a distinctive way by the residents of ashgabat this year . 
on the eve of the national holiday a simple fairy tale ,  or ,  as the poet put it ,  sublime illusion ,  carried a message of french-turkmen friendship . 
the french jules verne cultural centre in turkmenistan certainly hit the mark when it chose to invite the writer and director guylaine kasza from paris to stage a performance at the turkmen state youth drama theatre . 
born in paris in <num>1957</num>  , guylaine kasza is an amazingly gifted and energetic person . 
she belongs to that group of storytellers who ,  following the tradition ,  are today opening up ever new possibilities for the development of the genre . 
maximum use is made of body language and body movement ,  sometimes augmented by retorts in turkmen ,  french ,  or russian . 
although the heroes speak in various languages ,  everyone understands everything . 
evidently this universal body language is able to communicate qualities which thoughts expressed in language are unable to convey . 
the heroes of the various fairy tales are always in search of a magical potion to save them from their beastly transformations ,  but invariably they discover the transformative power of undying love ,  and therein lay the greatest wonder of all . 
and this is story the turkmen performers told once again from the stage .

turkmen theatre is relatively undeveloped ,  but in its history of less than a century ,  it has had some remarkable achievements . 
the accident occurred at <num>6</num>  : 35am . 
homes and businesses were without electricity ,  town traffic lights failed and strategic facilities switched to their own generators . 
he added that the situation was compounded by sharply lower temperatures in central asia which resulted in a spike in demand for energy in tajikistan ,  contributing to the system overload and consequent automatic shutdown of the power system .

dushanbe - computers and household ,  office and sports equipment worth approximately us$25 , 000 have been supplied to a half-way house at a prison hospital in dushanbe which rehabilitates former inmates with drug addictions . 
the equipment was supplied by the central asia drug action programme  ( cadap )  funded by the eu and implemented by the un development programme  ( undp )  . 
cadaps head in tajikistan ,  suhrob kahharov ,  said that the half-way house was opened as part of a project to prevent the spread of drugs in prisons . 
addicts who are released from prison can go there for temporary accommodation and assistance in obtaining new documents and passports . 
former prisoners can also receive professional and technical training ,  and help in finding jobs and re-establishing contact with relatives . 
diplomats claim irans nuclear plant is seven years old
the uranium enrichment facility near qom ,  <num>156</num>  kilometer  southwest of tehran ,  inspected by the un iaea in october . 
both the construction timeline and the size of the facility ,  inspected last month by the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  ,  are important in assessing tehran's true nuclear intentions . 
international hopes that iran was ready for at least a partial concession on sanctions were raised after tehran signaled in early october that it was ready to send most of its enriched natanz stockpile abroad to be further enriched and turned into metal fuel rods for its small research reactor . 
since then ,  however ,  iranian officials have overwhelmingly ,  even if still unofficially ,  rejected exporting most of their enriched uranium .

tajikistan and poland establish economic cooperation
slavomir szczalkovsky of the polish embassy in tajikistan says the current level of trade ,  investment and economic interaction between the two countries does not reflect their full potential . 
he believes the main reason for the absence of polish investment in tajikistan is that both countries lack economic information about the other . 
currently ,  only three firms in tajikistan have polish capital .

according to the minister ,  persistent organic pollutants  ( pops )  seeped into the walls of the warehouse ,  where the toxic condensers were kept . 
he declared that an emergency would allow interior ministry forces to be deployed to the firing range ,  both to protect local residents and carry out an investigation into the causes of the seepage . 
ashimov added that after his department received the necessary financing ,  the warehouses would be dismantled ,  transferred to a remote location and completely buried . 
the condensers are to be dismantled by a german firm that earlier removed some of them from daryal-u . 
the minister said he understood the remaining condensers would be transported to germany for dismantling by the end of the year ,  at the expense of german investors .

the build up of a transparent and nationwide justice system is still one of the biggest challenges of the restructuring of afghanistan ,  said the german federal foreign ministry . 
the german government is determined to focus further on justice and human rights within the scope of the intensification of civil restructuring . 
the undp programme supports the afghan governments efforts to build up the justice system . 
to this end ,  the german government decided to back civil reconstruction and provide a more nationwide engagement . 
at the afghanistan conference in paris  ( june <num>2008</num>  )  ,  german federal foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier announced a noticeably enlarged civil reconstruction aid commitment from germany of about <num>140</num>  €  million each year until <num>2010</num>  .
with this ,  the german civil engagement will reach more than <num>1</num>  €  billion in total . 
tajikistan pins hope on chinese investors
tajikistans hydropower plant construction and processing facilities for cotton and aluminium are most in need of investment . 
tajikistans government hopes to receive funds needed to move ahead with these projects through a programme of preferential credit provided by the chinese government to member nations of the shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  . 
according to association for sino-european technical and economic cooperation chairman sui bin tsin ,  who headed the chinese delegation ,  the chinese government places great importance on developing economic ties with central asia through the framework of the sco . 
 " even during these economically turbulent times ,  the chinese government will lend a hand to sco member-nations and award us$10 billion in credit ,  some of which the tajik government can apply for ,  "  siu said . 
chairman of tajikistan's state committee on investment and public property davlatali saidov emphasised that tajikistan's most pressing investment needs are related to hydropower plant construction and facilities for cotton and aluminium processing . 
he also drew chinese investors' attention to the world's largest silver lode ,  the bolshoy koni mansur . 
rights to mine it will be awarded through an international tender . 
at present ,  <num>20</num>  chinese companies and four joint enterprises with chinese shares are operating in the central asian nation . 
since independence ,  tajikistan has signed more than a hundred agreements with china ,  mostly on economic cooperation . 
figures compiled by the state statistics committee show that the value of trade between the two countries in <num>2008</num>  exceeded more than <num>1.5</num>  $  billion . 
hoping to receive a significant share of china's credit to sco member nations ,  in october tajikistan began to use the chinese yuan to settle payments with china ,  a move analysts in tajikistan see as linking trade and economic relations between the countries more closely and perhaps leading to china soon becoming tajikistan's main investment partner . 
pakistan trims deficit by <num>5.6</num>  $  billion
 ( reuters / athar hussain ) 
karachi - the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  balance of payments report released on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
according to the report ,  between july and october ,  pakistans current account deficit fell to <num>1</num>  $  billion from <num>6.6</num>  $  billion in <num>2008</num>  , a drop of nearly <num>84</num>  percent . 
we reduced imports by <num>3.7</num>  $  billion ,  increased remittances ,  and got more financial assistance from international donors that narrowed down the deficit almost to the bottom line ,  he added . 
another cut in the deficit was due to foreign exchange reserves surging to <num>12</num>  $  billion by october ,  up from <num>4.3</num>  $  billion the year before ,  he said . 
during the last two years ,  the account deficit deprived pakistan of about <num>20</num>  $  billion . 
this financial year ,  however ,  the government reduced the deficit to a minimum via different measures ,  tarin said . 
from july to october ,  pakistan received <num>1.45</num>  $  billion from the world bank and the asian development bank ,  up from last years <num>870</num>  $  million ,  tarin said . 
the imf and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  will provide about <num>2</num>  $  billion to pakistan in next few weeks ,  which will further stabilise the financial position of the country for this financial year  ( fy )  ,  he added .

tajikistan braces for electricity crisis
at a dushanbe press conference on july <num>29</num>  , the deputy head of tajikistan energy ,  rustam rakhimov ,  reported that the electricity holding company has offered a proposal for consideration by the government on introducing restrictions on energy use in the country during night-time hours . 
if the government accepts this decision then the limits will be introduced ,  rakhimov told journalists . 
at the same time ,  he expressed doubts that this measure will completely solve the problem with the energy supply during next winter . 
because of the shortages of electric power ,  restrictions on energy use are introduced every year in tajikistan starting in october and lasting until the beginning of april . 
however ,  during the last autumn-winter period the restrictions on energy use were removed only during the second ten-day period of <abbr>may.</abbr> 
according to tajikistan energy ,  during the autumn-winter period of <num>2007</num> -<num>2008</num>  the shortfall in electric power was <num>4.5</num>  billion kilowatt-hours  ( kwh )  . 
last winter the unusual cold forced the power engineers in tajikistan to introduce severe restrictions on supplies of electric power to consumers . 
as a result ,  industrial enterprises in the country were brought to a standstill . 
the public ,  including in the countrys capital dushanbe ,  had electricity only for four hours ,  and in remote mountainous regions there was none at all . 
also ,  the countrys economy was harmed to the sum of <num>850</num>  $  million ,  according to government figures . 
in this file photo ,  shaman ali displays oversized tools used at a hydroelectric dam and power plant march <num>13</num>  , <num>2007</num>  .

during the first half of <num>2008</num>  , <num>12.7</num>  percent less electricity ,  that is ,  <num>6.6</num>  billion kw less ,  was generated . 
the power engineers blame the introduction of annual restrictions on the falling level of water in the river vakhsh ,  which is the main source for the generation of electric power in the country . 
according to their figures ,  the level of water in the river on which the nurek power plant-the republics largest power generator-stands ,  is only <num>83</num>  percent . 
on july <num>22</num>  , at a press conference in dushanbe ,  gul sherali ,  the tajikistan minister of energy and industry ,  reported that something on the order of <num>64</num>  billion kwh of electric power is being generated in the country ,  of which about <num>12</num>  million kwh are exported to uzbekistan ,  and <num>1</num>  million kwh to kyrgyzstan . 
during the winter period last year ,  each day tajikistan imported more than <num>10</num>  million kilowatt-hours ,  in particular from kyrgyzstan ,  turkmenistan ,  and uzbekistan . 
notwithstanding the fact that the government is trying to take steps to extricate tajikistan from its energy dependence on other countries ,  up to now ,  no movement in this direction has been noted .

human rights group urges tajikistan to combat domestic violence
a woman from the village of sangtuda ,  <num>150</num>  kilometer  south of dushanbe ,  hauls water . 
tajikistan - a report issued by the human rights organisation ,  amnesty international ,  calls on the government of tajikistan to treat violence against women as a crime and prosecute offenders . 
it characterised tajik government efforts to resolve the issue of domestic violence as inadequate . 
the report asserts that violence against women ,  and particularly violence within the family ,  is a widespread occurrence in tajikistan . 
it reveals that between one third and half of all tajik women regularly face physical ,  psychological or sexual abuse at the hands of their husbands or in-laws . 
it also asserts that the attitude of the tajik authorities towards the problem is that women themselves are the source of domestic violence . 
one of its authors ,  andrea strasser-camagni ,  commented that tajik authorities  " see their primary role as mediator ,  to preserve the family rather than protect women and safeguard their rights .  " 
 " traditional tajik family values ,  reinforced after the break-up of the soviet union ,  impose further discrimination on women by narrowing their identity to that of wife and mother ,  or limiting them into the lowest paid jobs ,  "  she contended . 
the report also notes that there are few organisations to which victims of domestic violence can turn ,  and those that do exist are generally funded by international organisations and not state or local authorities . 
in addition ,  the police ,  judiciary and medical staffs in tajikistan are not adequately trained to deal with cases of domestic violence effectively . 
to change this dismal situation ,  the report calls on tajik authorities to adopt a law on violence in the family ,  and establish a nationwide service to reduce its occurrence . 
nine months of the year are spent growing cotton . 
developing tajik cotton production to its maximum potential would require an average increase in yield to <num>30</num>  centners per hectare and an investment of us$400 million more ,  in the industry for which funding from abroad is unlikely due to the financial crisis and the global drop in demand for processed cotton . 
many farmers are still unable to sell the remainder of last year's harvest ,  which totalled <num>380,000</num>  tonnes nationwide . 
selling it at current prices will not even cover their production expenses . 
data released by the state statistics committee of tajikistan show that processed cotton exports between january and october <num>2009</num>  totalled <num>63,900</num>  tonnes worth <num>68.8</num>  $  million ,  or <num>3,000</num>  tonnes and <num>20.7</num>  $  million less than last year . 
the average price of processed cotton during this period was <num>1076</num>  $  per tonne ,  or <num>260</num>  $  less than during the same period in <num>2008</num>  .

large numbers of portraits began disappearing in <num>2007</num>  .
not very long after the death of the father of all turkmens ,  portraits were taken down from facades of government ministries ,  local administrations ,  state institutions ,  universities and schools . 
even the very first stone statue of niyazov ,  standing in front of a tannery on the outskirts of turkmenabat ,  was not immune . 
the structure was dismantled in may <num>2007</num>  .
in may <num>2008</num>  , under the pretext of renovating the capitals train station ,  the turkmenbashi statue occupying the square was taken down . 
of that memorial ,  only two metal posts remain . 
having stood for fourteen years since may <num>1994</num>  , the ex-presidents statue in turkmenabats central square followed suit ,  disappearing on july <num>20</num>  .
before that ,  a statue of lenin had graced the spot for a full half-century . 
statues of the countrys former leader are being dismantled in mary and dasoguz regions ,  as well as in all the localities of turkmenistans eastern region . 
as reported previously ,  july <num>7</num>  saw turkmenistan television broadcast without the golden logo-a profile of the late president ,  niyazov-that had adorned turkmenistan tv for many years . 
if the rule of niyazov in turkmenistan has been characterised as the golden age of the country ,  the current era has been dubbed the age of rebirth ,  according to a television programme on the ren tv network . 
the enormous arch surmounted by a golden statue of niyazov will soon be moved from asgabats central square to its outskirts . 
the decision was recently handed down by the higher echelons of the government . 
now this miraculous statue will be hidden in a desert area ,  far from the eyes of foreign visitors-whose numbers are growing daily . 
nevertheless ,  even american guests are still obliged to adapt to local customs . 
ellis ,  a volunteer in turkmenistan ,  was leery of giving an interview for fear he might be expelled from the country . 
according to the reports of human rights activists ,  turkmen prisons continue to hold dozens of political prisoners . 
some of them are holders of russian passports . 
despite this ,  russian officials visiting asgabat in government delegations show little interest in the fate of their fellow citizens . 
experts believe that only the good will of the turkmen government can change the political prisoners situation ,  and that there is no use waiting for russia to engage this issue .

the news comes as the foreign ministers of the alliance gathered in brussels for two days of talks . 
they are expected to focus on a request by <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama for nato allies to send some <num>10,000</num>  more troops . 
a spokesman said members were set to pledge more than <num>5,000</num>  .

italian defence minister ignazio la russa told the corriere della sera newspaper on december <num>3</num>  that rome would send about <num>1,000</num>  extra troops to afghanistan . 
it currently has <num>3,200</num>  soldiers there . 
russian president dmitry medvedev ,  speaking after a meeting with italy's prime minister silvio berlusconi ,  indicated that russia ,  too ,  would do its part in afghanistan . 
 " we are ready to support these efforts ,  guarantee the transit of troops ,  take part in economic projects and train police and the military .  " 
 " well over <num>20</num>  countries have already indicated they intend to increase their troops numbers in afghanistan ,  "  said nato spokesman james appathurai . 
 " failure in afghanistan would mean a taliban takeover of much ,  if not most ,  of the country and likely a renewed civil war . 
based on what we have heard in the last <num>24</num>  hours <abbr>…</abbr>  we are already beyond the <num>5,000</num>  figure . 
 "  he confirmed ,  however ,  that there were still  " significant shortfalls "  in required numbers of army and police trainers . 
the full extent of additional resources coming from nato allies remains unclear . 
it is expected that more member countries will declare their intentions over the next two days . 
many nato governments face publics sceptical about the mission in afghanistan .

kyrgyzstan to regulate rates for social advertising in media
kyrgyz journalists propose the creation of reasonable rate structures that will allow ngos to place public service adverts to inform the public about priority social objectives in the mass media . 
 ( andrei smirnov / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - parliament deputies have announced an initiative to develop a new draft law on social advertising that involves a group of its members ,  ministry of health representatives ,  ngos ,  journalists and lawyers .

without discounts in advertising rates ,  they will soon find themselves unable to place ads .

as a result ,  restrictions on the supply of electricity were imposed nationwide at peak consumption times during the morning . 
the head of the power plant ,  saparbek balkibekov ,  said the event was not a power failure ,  but an unplanned switching-off of two units . 
kyrgyz energy minister ilyas davydov said that the situation was under control ,  but there was some minor damage that needed to be repaired . 
experts believe the shutdowns of the two units were due to the fact that despite the scheduled preventative maintenance works carried out this year ,  the plants hydraulic and electrical equipment has already exceeded its intended lifespan . 
the generation units went into service <num>35</num>  years ago and no overhauls or upgrades have been carried out since then . 
he added that the company planned to develop and modernise its equipment by <num>2015</num>  .

tashkent -- the world bank has recently announced plans to buy more than <num>4</num>  $  million in equipment and to spend <num>3</num>  $  million in services for the second phase of its rural enterprise support project  ( resp )  in uzbekistan . 
the second phase of the resp is slated to begin in early <num>2010</num>  .
world bank officials began considering a second phase in <num>2008</num>  after the success of resps first phase ,  which ran from <num>2001</num>  to <num>2007</num>  .
the first phase of the world bank project had positive results ,  said jumabaev buzrukhon ,  head of the governments ministry of rural and water economy . 
i want to particularly mention that in the first phase we managed to carry out reconstruction of the irrigation-drainage system in seven regions of the republic with the financial sources of the project ,  buzrukhon told central asia online . 
baxtiyor shermatov ,  a consultant for agricultural business under the association of uzbek farmers ,  said that farmers who took part in the first phase of the project received about <num>80</num>  combines ,  tractors and other farm equipment along with the financial resources to improve irrigation of their crops . 
the second phase of resp is aimed at expanding the project to newly independent farmers … who did not benefit from the original project ,  according to a <num>2008</num>  world bank report . 
the plan calls for the purchase of goods such as maintenance equipment ,  vehicles and office equipment ,  as well as services such as facility renovations . 
matlyooba mukhamedova ,  a world bank specialist in uzbek affairs ,  said resp is part of the world banks strategy for developing uzbekistan and that the uzbek government requested the implementation of the second phase . 
in the first phase of the project only seven regions of the country were covered ;  the second phase will include <num>90</num>  rural regions of uzbekistan . 
the project is being financed by a loan from the world banks international development association  ( ida )  ,  the uzbek government and swiss agency for development and cooperation  ( sdc )  . 
the programs goal is to improve the productivity and profitability of the uzbekistans agricultural businesses . 
uzbekistans dependence on the agricultural sector was the main rationale behind the decision of the world bank to start the rural enterprise support project in … <num>2001</num> -<num>2007</num>  , the sdc said in a project assessment . 
the second phase of the project has three main objectives for achieving that goal :  financing agricultural businesses ,  training and advising farmers ,  and improving irrigation and drainage projects . 
the financial goal is to provide loans and leases to businesses for investments such as farm machinery ,  feed storage and packaging ,  as well as to pay for agricultural services . 
mukhamedova said the financial goal is significant to helping farmers just as it was in the first phase . 
the funding for the farming economy was effective . 
five thousand farmers in the country received long-term credits for three to seven years . 
this was especially useful for the farmers since the local commercial banks give farmers only short-term credits ,  mukhamedova said . 
according to a procurement plan released on december <num>1</num>  , the world bank has already budgeted about <num>300,000</num>  $  in credit lines and loans to provide to farmers and agricultural businesses . 
the second goal is to improve the nations irrigation and drainage systems to improve water management and service nationwide . 
the irrigation improvements are mainly being financed by two sdc loans worth more than us <num>6</num>  $  million . 
according to an april <num>2008</num>  world bank report ,  the efforts to improve uzbek irrigation and drainage will focus on maintenance ,  reconstruction or alterations to existing infrastructure along the syr darya and amur darya rivers ,  both of which are international waterways . 
additionally ,  world bank advisers will provide demonstrations to farmers on techniques for creating and maintain irrigation canals . 
the third goal for the second phase of resp is to improve training among uzbek farmers through advisory services . 
international advisors will provide agricultural training on issues ranging from entrepreneurship and accounting to farm business and water management to mass media marketing . 
according to the sdc ,  <num>64</num>  percent of uzbekistans population lives in rural areas and <num>32</num>  percent of the labor force works in agriculture . 
uzbek agriculture generates <num>70</num>  percent of domestic trade and provides <num>90</num>  percent of the nations agricultural products . 
return of peace in swat leads to business revival
shoppers are returning to markets in swat . 
like other walks of life ,  business was severely affected by militant rule in swat . 
expulsion of the taliban by troops last summer is normalising matters . 
 [ arshad yusufzai ] 
but the path to normality hasnt been completely smooth . 
after a february <num>22</num>  suicide bombing at nishat chowk that killed <num>13</num>  people  ( including four women )  ,  business at nearby cheena market temporarily fell off . 
but the effect wasnt permanent ,  and shoppers and merchants are once again doing business . 
during taliban rule ,  people in swat ,  and particularly women ,  were reluctant to visit markets unless it was really necessary ,  said a customer at the cheena market . 
women leaving their home had to be accompanied by an adult male member of the family . 
those restrictions are gone now . 
they can go shopping in the marketplace . 
some local businesses ,  such as hotels and stands that sell handicrafts ,  woollen shawls and dried fruits ,  make money only if tourists visit the swat valley during the summer . 
many businesses collapsed as most residents of the area fled before and during the military operation against the taliban . 
the estimated losses suffered by businesses in swat were nearly <num>750</num>  billion rupees  ( us$ <num>8.82</num>  meter  )  ,  said zahid khan ,  president of the all swat hotels association . 
saleem shah ,  <num>29</num>  , owns a garment shop in cheena market . 
he said the markets are crowded with buyers and that sales went up after the taliban defeat . 
my shop is doing even better than it was before the taliban emerged ,  saleem said . 
he said inflation was making things difficult for many customers ,  yet overall the market was in better shape than it had been under the taliban . 
saleem hoped the summer would be even better ,  since tourists from across the country are expected to swarm the valley now that peace prevails . 
a <num>32</num> -year-old jeweller ,  muhammad khaliq ,  is less content . 
my shop wasnt generating enough money even to pay the rent and utility bills during taliban rule ,  and the situation is more or less the same ,  khaliq said . 
he blamed the global rise in gold prices as one cause of his problems . 
akbar ali ,  <num>43</num>  , sells school uniforms and childrens garments . 
his shop is quite busy ,  he said ,  but most customers are merely window-shopping . 
since the talibans departure ,  men and women are freely visiting the markets ,  but only a few are serious buyers . 
i am glad that i can manage the rent and utility bills ,  akbar said while fitting shoes on a little girls feet . 
he also complained that motorists are not allowed to park their cars on the roadside . 
they dont want to walk long distances to buy dried fruit ,  he said . 
we are forced to sell dried fruits at high prices because they come expensive to us . 
the prices arent stable for even a single week ,  added nabi . 
fazlur rahman ,  <num>31</num>  , owns a grocery . 
he blamed inflation and the slow delivery of goods to the market as the main causes of his economic hardship . 
the prices are almost <num>300</num>  %  of the normal rates ,  and it takes a long time for goods to reach us because of delays at checkpoints ,  rahman lamented . 
some checkpoints require individuals passing through them to wait as long as half an hour . 
tajik business owners complain of corrupt officials ,  high interest rates
nazar ,  a vendor in dushanbe ,  says running a business in tajikistan is hard . 
the majority of business owners avoid courting attention . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe - tajik business owners reject government officials claims that the country has favourable conditions for entrepreneurs . 
i heard it is possible to quickly register your business ,  said nazar ,  a vendor in dushanbe . 
i wanted to open a chain of stores but ran into a bunch of problems and changed my mind . 
he sells foodstuffs . 
the returns are good ,  except there are a lot of examiners ,  nazar said . 
if you do not give each one a cut ,  they will find a reason to shut you down . 
the july <num>2009</num>  law on the registration of legal entities and individual entrepreneurs made starting a business relatively easy ,  economist ulugbek madumarov said . 
before ,  registration required <num>13</num>  procedures ;  now it needs only three ,  madumarov said . 
the number of documents has fallen from <num>30</num>  to seven . 
this smacks of the new registration method being implemented to create an additional source of revenue for the budget ,  not to simplify the registration of private businesses ,  he said . 
the association for the development and support of entrepreneurship estimates that approximately <num>500,000</num>  individuals operate businesses in the country - more than <num>40</num>  %  of the workforce . 
in <num>2008</num>  , the government imposed a two-year-long moratorium on inspections in the private sector . 
it ends this july . 
still ,  the moratorium boosted business . 
many  ( companies )  spread their wings and took off . 
after all ,  they were able to save on illicit payoffs and protection money ,  jumayev said . 
but our countrys regulatory authorities did not really care for the moratorium ,  said nekrui zabirov ,  chairman of the co-ordination council of business and public associations of tajikistan . 
if <abbr>…</abbr>  we cannot persuade the president to renew it for two years ,  this may end up a disaster for small- and medium-sized business . 
the state authorities are just biding their time for when they can inspect us . 
it is terrible to imagine what the influx of regulatory authorities and the outflow of business owners from the country will be like ,  zabirov said . 
taxation is another hurdle . 
the current tax code is unreadable ,  the source said . 
another problem is the lack of working capital ,  said rahim ,  the owner of two automobile repair shops . 
getting loans from banks is not a realistic option if you do not give someone a cut . 
the national bank said <num>13</num>  banks and <num>123</num>  credit ,  financial and microfinance institutions issue loans in tajikistan . 
the osce office also runs a program to support small-business development . 
the first microfinance bank of tajikistan wont give start-up loans because of the risk involved ,  said jamshed niyatbekov ,  a credit analyst at the bank . 
interest rates are stiff . 
the annual interest rate is <num>25</num>  %  in dollars and <num>35</num>  %  in tjs . 
new businesses can receive loans up to us <num>7,000</num>  $  at <num>30</num>  %  annually ,  akbar inoyatov ,  a representative of the imon international microlending organisation ,  said . 
the interest rate on loans in tjs is as much as <num>40</num>  %  . 
 ( such terms )  are simply unthinkable ,  rahim said . 
you cannot develop money this quickly . 
but starting a business without a loan is also impossible . 
high rates are likely here to stay . 
each bank decides  ( interest rates )  for itself ,  according to the national bank . 
umarov spoke of risks successful business owners face if they lack the protection of senior officials :  if private business owners work and receive high returns ,  the authorities and  ( those close to them )  will do their all to sweep the business into their own hands ,  he said . 
businesses cannot survive unless the environment improves ,  jumayev said . 
together with illegal or shady payoffs ,  private business owners are now feeding the entire country "  ,  he said . 
 " but that cannot last for too long "  . 
border closures strangle kyrgyz economy
the kelechek candy factory in dzhalal-abad ,  faced with the threat of running out of imported syrup ,  has furloughed its employees . 
 [ bakyt ibraimov ] 
bishkek -- kyrgyzstans entrepreneurs are enduring huge losses ,  unable to trade with neighbouring countries that sealed their borders following last months uprising against then-president kurmanbek bakiyev . 
they are not allowing goods to pass through kyrgyz-kazakh control checkpoints ,  said <num>47</num> -year-old askar mambetov ,  a farmer from chui oblast . 
for practically a month now ,  our kazakh partners have not been able to come here for milk . 
kazakhstan and uzbekistan unilaterally shut their borders because of the april <num>7</num> -<num>8</num>  events ,  kyrgyz state border service  ( sbs )  deputy chairman cholponbek turusbekov told central asia online . 
the roadway connections to these countries remain closed to date . 
kyrgyz citizens can still cross the borders by rail or air as passengers ,  he said . 
the kyrgyz foreign ministry released a press release april <num>30</num>  that the european union has asked kazakhstan and uzbekistan to :  open their borders with kyrgyzstan at their earliest opportunity to alleviate the situation in kyrgyzstan . 
kazakh foreign minister kanat saudabayev said ,   [ t ] he issue of opening the border <abbr>…</abbr>  will be resolved at the earliest opportunity ,  according to the kyrgyz press release . 
the kyrgyz interim government has repeatedly made reassurances that the kazakhs will reopen the border ,  but nothing has changed . 
the problem with the opening of the kyrgyz-kazakh border is about to be resolved ,  interim government deputy chairman almaz atambayev told the media april <num>29</num>  .
two weeks ago <abbr>…</abbr>  kazakh prime minister karim masimov initially opened the border . 
but as soon as the riots broke out in the village of mayevka ,  the checkpoints closed . 
another reason for the kazakh border closure ,  explained atambayev ,  is that bakiyevs supporters left many military weapons in kyrgyzstan . 
neighbouring governments do not want the weapons smuggled into their countries . 
the continuing blockade has compelled kyrgyz business leaders to write to russian and kazakh presidents dmitry medvedev and nursultan nazarbayev to appeal for the reopening of frontiers . 
kazakhstan and russia are experiencing an increase in the prices of  ( kyrgyz )  products that <abbr>…</abbr>  are not currently being exported . 
the volume of processed dairy production is <num>500</num>  tonnes per day ,  and more than <num>70</num>  %  of it is exported . 
supply disruption and late export of perishable foods can halt conveyor belts and cost jobs ,  she said . 
companies stalled by the closure of the kyrgyz-kazakh border are running out of capital ,  she said . 
she warned of the bankruptcy of the dairy industry if the border doesnt reopen soon . 
my business has suffered severely . 
i am thinking of turning to our authorities so that they ask the kazakh authorities to quickly open the border . 
prices have fallen so sharply that revenue no longer covers production costs ,  he added . 
the clothing industry is experiencing similar problems as kyrgyzstan exports garments to kazakhstan ,  russia ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan . 
warehouses are bulging and factories have begun to shut down ,  said sergei ponomarev ,  president of the association of markets ,  trade and services sectors in kyrgyzstan . 
the countrys two biggest wholesale markets have seen a drop-off in the number of buyers ,  he added ,  referring to dordoi market in bishkek and kara-suu market near the uzbek border . 
almost <num>150,000</num>  workers employed in the garment industry have been left without work ,  he said . 
afghanistans revival of honey production

uzbekistan makes cash hard to get amid economic woes
the uzbek government has taken pains to impose tighter controls on cash ,  shifting many payments to debit cards . 
people spend hours in line at atms ,  hoping to get cash . 
 [ shukur azimov ] 
tashkent - even as the uzbek government touts its economic performance ,  many independent economists and consumers complain of currency depreciation and soaring inflation . 
sevar mekhraliyeva ,  a <num>70</num> -year-old math teacher with a <num>30</num> -year career ,  just retired . 
her only son died of tb in <num>2002</num>  .
i have nobody to support me now ;  nobody ever cares for us retirees ,  she said bitterly . 
younger people fare no better . 
i have nothing left for everything else . 
the labour and social protection ,  and economy ministries declined to officially comment on the situation . 
however one economy ministry official agreed to speak on condition of anonymity . 
the steep rise in food prices ,  utility rates and transit fares was caused by the large-scale depreciation of the  ( uzbek sum )  ,  the official said . 
the sum has been rapidly losing value against the us dollar . 
the official exchange rate is uzs <num>1,590</num>  per dollar . 
the real rate is about uzs <num>2,190</num>  to the dollar  ( <num>38</num>  %  lower )  . 
officially ,  this years inflation is estimated at <num>8</num>  %  ,  but in real terms it is much higher . 
sometimes ,  though ,  the government contradicts itself . 
a central bank press release april <num>22</num>  said in the first quarter of this year monetary factors did not affect the level of consumer prices and inflation remained within the predicted limits . 
but a finance ministry press release acknowledged a <num>25</num>  %  growth of transit fares as of april <num>1</num>  , a <num>9</num>  %  increase in electricity rates ,  a <num>22</num>  %  spike in natural-gas prices ,  and <num>20</num>  %  increases as of february <num>1</num>  for central heating and gas . 
some international observers predict uzbekistan will have a good economic year . 
the international monetary fund  ( imf )  is forecasting that the natural-gas-exporting country will have the highest <num>2010</num>  growth rate  ( <num>9.2</num>  %  )  among commonwealth of independent states  ( cis )  members . 
in a statement ,  imf deputy managing director naoyuki shinohara ,  who visited uzbekistan last week ,  praised the countrys very cautious approach to borrowing on global financial markets ,  which limited the countrys exposure to the global crisis . 
relative isolation from the world economy is another defence for the uzbek economy ,  the imf said . 
experts cite uzbekistans use of policies that restrict the import of goods while exporting natural resources and manufactured goods to earn hard currency . 
viktor ivonin ,  a former researcher with the economics institute of the uzbek academy of sciences ,  disagreed . 
one can hardly call uzbekistans economy a closed one - we have huge volumes of exports and imports ,  and export-import ties are intensive ,  he said . 
price hikes in other countries push up our prices ,  too . 
the government is dealing with unprofitable utilities and public transit ,  he said . 
in soviet times ,  the government subsidised such services . 
but uzbekistan cant afford to ,  he said . 
the state budget is short of money now ,  he said . 
in any transitional economy ,  the state budget gradually sheds the burden of financing utilities and public transit . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  food and commodities inevitably grow more expensive . 
the finance ministry has taken on the nationwide shortage of money ,  he said ,  but one problem is that uzbeks may be hoarding cash . 
chances are high that the financial and banking systems might collapse ,  he warned . 
to prevent the sums downfall ,  the uzbek government has taken pains to <abbr>…</abbr>  reduce cash payments to residents "  . 
the government is pushing citizens to use plastic cards rather than cash ,  he said . 
 " the majority of people in the west are well accustomed to credit cards - something still impossible in uzbekistan ,  "  the anonymous economy ministry official said . 
 " many try to withdraw cash from banks but hear  ' no '  without an explanation "  ,  he said . 
furthermore ,  those who want cash from their own bank accounts pay a <num>1.5</num>  %  commission . 
and atms - especially working ones - are rare ,  even in tashkent . 
 " my employer transfers over half of my salary to my plastic card ,  but every atm i find happens to have run out of cash "  ,  said a tashkent-based clerk named rustam . 
he goes through intermediaries and pays a <num>20</num>  %  commission . 
 " you can use a plastic card only in large supermarkets ,  where prices are much higher than in small shops or at the market "  ,  rustam said . 
but hassanov the labourer said ,   " people queue up at the atm for hours in the cold and become very frustrated when the machine runs out of cash before their turn "  . 
tajikistan criticises telecom industry
cell providers billboards in dushanbe came down may <num>6</num>  but returned may <num>10</num>  .
tajik authorities call cell phones a hazardous luxury . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
by his estimates ,  keeping one cell phone costs a tajik family us <num>11</num>  $  per month . 
the average monthly salary is us <num>80</num>  $  .
in <num>2009</num>  , cellular providers earned more than us <num>2009</num>  , . 
seventy-five percent of the countrys <num>8</num>  meter  inhabitants own mobile phones ,  rakhmon said . 
what is at issue is regulation of the advertising market ,  not tearing down all the billboards ,  saidov said . 
local television networks launched a campaign against cell phone use ,  which the president called a possible cause of cancer . 
rakhmon personally instructed all educational institutions and the local media to transmit his message . 
each reporter must prepare several stories explaining the hazards of using cellular telephones ,  said a state tv journalist ,  who requested anonymity . 
we are supposed to persuade people this is unaffordable luxury at a time of a financial crisis . 
konstantin bondarenko ,  director of the national association of small and medium-sized businesses ,  who has worked in telecom regulation for six years ,  said neither doctors nor the transport and communications ministry has ever seen any medical research data showing that cellular communications indeed threaten health . 
a recently completed ten-year study of <num>13,000</num>  people by the world health organization found no conclusive link between cell phone use and brain cancer . 
however researchers said there were some problems with the study and that more research needs to be done . 
for many ,  having a cell phone is a necessity . 
but some feel the tajik government is now making the phones less efficient . 
on may <num>14</num>  , the transport and communications ministry prohibited calls from the stationary home telephones operated by the state company tochiktelecom to clients of the cellular provider tacom ,  which provides services under the beeline trademark . 
communications deputy minister beg zukhurov pinned the blame on tacom . 
we found that company breaching existing regulations ,  he said . 
it unlawfully set up a radio relay station - an antenna receiving and transmitting satellite signals - near the afghan border . 
tacom has a licence to operate the relay station ,  company spokeswoman marina roshkina said . 
tacom has suffered tens of thousands of dollars in losses ;  if the conflict drags on ,  the company will have the right to sue ,  roshkina said . 
the newspaper fakty i kommentarii ,  citing local analysts ,  reported that cellular providers received unofficial suggestions to purchase shares in the rogun hydropower project worth us <num>14</num>  ,-<num>10</num>  meter  ,  but they declined . 
thats pure gossip ,  said an mlt representative who asked to remain anonymous . 
of course ,  telecom operators did buy the hydropower projects shares ,  but the whole thing most likely boils down to yet another attempt to unite us within a single switching centre  ( within )  the state-run tochiktelecom . 
quite understandably ,  the state wishes to take this market under control ,  he said . 
at the same time ,  its attempts to put the industry in order have been wrongful and aggressive . 
government policy has only been scaring potential investors away ,  complained gafur irkayev ,  president of the telecom operators association . 
still from the right to life animation . 
 ( animaster ) 
the <num>15</num> -minute animation was produced by the animaster studio in shymkent ,  which has already produced a number of videos dealing with social and legal issues . 
right to life is intended to combat discrimination against hiv / aids sufferers . 
director of animaster mahsut zharimbetov said the videos creators set out to educate the public about problems faced by sufferers of the disease . 
our goal is to encourage public tolerance and sympathy towards hiv / aids sufferers ,  he explained . 
we want to persuade society through our animation that carriers of the virus pose no threat to those around them and have the same rights as healthy people . 
the videos heroine ,  dilya ,  is based on a variety of life stories and situations experienced by real hiv sufferers . 
through her experiences ,  the videos creators attempt to show that despite the prevailing view that hiv is caught through sinful behaviour ,  people who lead blameless lifestyles can also be infected with the virus . 
pregnant and infected with hiv by her husband ,  who has left her ,  dilya follows advice from doctors so that her baby will be born healthy . 
the young woman has to endure intolerance and isolation ,  but her friends and relatives help her overcome the discrimination . 
kazakh art is worth a thousand words
a shadow of a spectator is seen next to art works of kazakh artist erbossyn meldibekov displayed at his exhibition called hyper muslim  ( gipermusulmanin )  at the guelman gallery in moscow <num>23</num>  march <num>2006</num>  .

astana ,  kazakhstan -- the demise of the soviet union created good conditions for the development of contemporary arts in kazakhstan . 
but <num>18</num>  years after kazakhstan became an independent republic ,  experts argue over the direction art is taking . 
the main problem ,  according to experts ,  lies with the indifference by the state and society toward contemporary arts in the country . 
since independence from the soviet union ,  contemporary arts development has mainly been funded by foreign charities ,  such as the soros and hivos foundations . 
the funds and enthusiasm of donors has since dried up ,  and the state has become the primary source of demand for artwork . 
the real support of the state in kazakhstan is defined as contractual work ordered by the state -- gozzakaz ,  tulegen baitukenov said ,  talking about the role of state funds in the development of contemporary arts in kazakhstan . 
rewriting history through the cultural icons and symbols is skillfully used by the regime to delete collective memory about the years of soviet rule and retrieve the glorious nomadic past instead . 
unfortunately ,  the contemporary arts created under the auspices of bureaucratic dirigisme often look ugly because the bureaucratic vision of what should be created clouds real talent . 
a recent example of this type of bureaucratic arts coercion provided by aelita zhumayeva is the new monument in astana ,  kazakh eli  ( kazakh people )  . 
artist kanat ibragimov went even further ,  saying they resemble the chinese terracotta army . 
huge amounts are allocated ,  zhumayeva said . 
however ,  very small amounts reach the target audience of talented artists . 
on the positive side ,  kazakh artists have been able to participate in global shows and present their creations in the worlds galleries . 
yet ,  the open borders could not guarantee the progress of arts in the emerging social fabric . 
the search for a national identity and going to the basics of a nomadic past in the arts have not provided much creative inspiration for local artists to produce cultural products that would receive global recognition . 
while the revitalization of the <num>1990</num>  second  brought hope for primordial kazakh artistry ,  the dissatisfaction of the <num>2000</num>  second  clearly showed that kazakh society is not ready to have a cultural dialogue with itself through the lenses of contemporary arts . 
this became evident since artistic visionaries have yet to be born and genuine arts supporters still need to be nourished in a community full of inertia . 
zhumayeva said there was a wave of kazakh artists whose works were treated with appreciation abroad . 
others dispute kazakhstans worldwide gains . 
for example ,  baitukenov doubts there are kazakh artists who are taken seriously internationally . 
his opinion is echoed by the representative of artistic talents ,  hard-edged performance producer kanat ibragimov ,  who says ,  kazakh artists abroad are playing the role of exotic fruits and the species of the limited culture ,  nothing else . 
the concept of charity for contemporary arts in kazakhstan is still somewhat unfamiliar . 
there is business support of the contemporary arts in the country ,  but it does not bring the level of contemporary arts to a new level . 
famous kazakh businessmen like nurlan smagulov and mukhtar ablyazov often financed the arts projects ,  baitukenov said . 
ablyazov ,  who headed bta bank ,  even led the alem art foundation to instigate the development of arts in kazakhstan . 
however ,  the foundation was disbanded after bta came close to bankruptcy and was nationalized . 
ibragimov has a different view on business support . 
the help of the private businessmen often depends on his personal relationship with the artist and the taste of the private sponsor himself ,  which is often awful and vulgar ,  he said . 
therefore ,  it seems that the state and business together with the society are not really ready to support the contemporary arts any time soon . 
she thinks negligence was the strongest instrument directed against the development of culture in kazakhstan . 
the consequences of this will appear in the form of kitsch and cultural excesses ,  common to the countries with weak cultural identities - the most recent example of it is united arab emirates . 
this reminds  ( us )  that the independence is not only political ,  but also ,  to a larger extent ,  is cultural ,  she said . 
uzbek cinema enjoys revival
this frame-grab is from the film superkelinchak  ( super daughter-in-law )  ,  an uzbek film that brought director bakhrom yakubov respect ,  glory - and a lot of money . 
in uzbekistan ,  filmgoers not only watch ,  but love films-especially uzbek ones . 
unlike many countries in the world ,  not only does uzbek cinema survive ,  it flourishes . 
perhaps that is why ,  in <num>2009</num>  , uzbekistan shot <num>46</num>  films ,  <num>36</num>  of which were private-studio funded . 
of course i love hollywood movies ,  but uzbek film is closer to my soul - it is closer to us . 
it portrays the same issues that we have and it makes it possible to look at oneself from the side ,  said sevar ,  <num>25</num>  .
uzbek film is from the soul ,  while hollywood ones - its just gunfire and comedies . 
more than <num>90</num>  percent of the national box office comes from uzbek films ;  indian ,  russian and hollywood productions represent the remainder . 
in uzbekistan it is possible to shoot a film for us <num>30,000</num>  $  , and many directors are certain that such films can generate a good profit . 
one of the most popular uzbek commercial directors ,  bakhrom yakubov ,  fills the cinemas . 
may my colleagues forgive me ,  but they have ruined uzbek cinema . 
filmgoers started leaving the cinema and they stopped coming altogether . 
in the <num>1980</num>  second  and <num>90</num>  second  ,  the cinemas were empty ;  no one cared about cinema . 
we should be thanking commercial directors for bringing filmgoers back to the theatres . 
the main stars of yakubovs films are singers - they are big in uzbek and russian show business . 
he says people are ready to buy cinema tickets ,  to see their idols on screen . 
we used these showbiz stars … in order to bring filmgoers back to the theatres . 
however ,  lately we have been using professional actors ,  the director said . 
independent film experts tend to see a different situation . 
well-known director ,  yusuf razykov ,  a former director for uzbekfilm ,  thinks that uzbek cinema has a long tradition and that one can speak of a new wave of uzbek cinema . 
his film ,  orator ,  about the stability of the folk traditions that lived through bolshevisation ,  is one of the most popular of the post-soviet period . 
even now ,  shukhrat abbasovs tashkent ;  city of bread is the acme of our studios . 
the film ,  shot in the aesthetics of italian neo-realism ,  is still very popular today ,  razykov said . 
like before ,  films are coming out without any real conflict or confrontation of ideas . 
only with the works that deeply reflect the specificities of an era ,  the changes in a society and the character of the people will cinema be able to appeal to filmgoers ,  touch their hearts and win a worthy place in the history of world cinema ,  he said . 
uzbek cinema is subject to censorship by the national agency uzbekkino . 
no studio can begin production without receiving script approval from uzbekkino . 
the agency also allocates public money for the production of artistic and documentary films . 
besides <num>300</num>  , more than <num>20</num>  other films are prohibited from being shown in uzbekistan for the same reason . 
amateur film director sergei tikhomirovs tashkentskaya brigada  ( tashkent brigade )  ,  aleksei balabanovs zhmurki  ( blind mans bluff )  ,  the recent hollywood hit brokeback mountain are among those on the black list . 
this prohibition includes uzbek television . 
re-editing and cutting out dialogues and intimate scenes that ,  according to officials ,  are not in accordance with the mentality of the uzbek people are normal practice . 
they are particularly selective with hollywood films . 
turkish or indian series are closer to our mentality ;  im not afraid to watch these kinds of films with my daughter . 
the abundance of these television series has led the uzbek government to understand that it must compete by producing its own series ,  and thus in june <num>2008</num>  it sanctioned the complex government program national series . 
according to documents from the uzbek state television and radio company ,  the plan is to create a large domestic industry for the production of television series and also soap operas like those from mexico and brazil . 
to achieve this ,  a special film studio has been built in tashkent . 
the soap operas already filmed are being broadcast on state and private television stations . 
however ,  actors complain that the pay is low . 
one day of shooting only pays us <num>20</num>  $  to <num>50</num>  $  for the lead role . 
uzbek stars earn as little as us <num>2,000</num>  $  to <num>5,000</num>  $  for a film . 
murod razhabovis is the highest paid uzbek film actor . 
he thinks it is possible to create a cinematic masterpiece if the film has a solid budget and good motivation for the actor . 
our actors are no worse than foreign ones . 
perhaps ,  in terms of technology we are behind the foreign countries with developed film industries . 
we could speak of competing with other countries if our sponsors would provide us with millions of dollars to produce a film ,  he said . 
we must have a good understanding of what the budget should be for a fairy-tale film ,  a modern urban location-shot film and a complex studio-shot film . 
if we want to compete with other countries-for example :  russia-we must not spare money on production . 
our filmgoers miss uzbek cinema ;  we must give them quality production - and in modern cinemas . 
meeting this challenge is our duty ,  said razykov . 
central asia ,  afghanistan celebrate novruz
traditionally ,  elders give their blessing by starting things ,  then younger competitors continue the tournament . 
the winner walks away with cash ,  a carpet or a sheep . 
 [ nozim kalandarov ] 
the celebrations vary from family to family and business to business . 
in almaty ,  daniyar alikov and his son planted an apple tree . 
kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev plans to take in a buzkashi match . 
for dilshod azimov ,  an uzbek retiree ,  the celebration will be a family feast . 
but no matter what religion they follow or what country they are in ,  everyone knows it is a time to celebrate . 
it is novruz . 
on march <num>20</num> -<num>21</num>  , the peoples of central asia will join others in india ,  iran ,  turkey ,  the trans-caucasus ,  russia ,  albania and macedonia in celebrating novruz ,  the holiday marking the arrival of the spring equinox . 
novruz means new day in farsi . 
we have evidence that the novruz celebration took place even in ancient times ,  said kazakh historian khakim ilzkhysbaev . 
the novruz celebration is connected to zoroastrianism ,  which had adherents from india to the near east . 
though the celebration has ancient roots ,  the ways to commemorate it appear to have evolved over time ,  based on each culture . 
for azimov ,  it is time to feast . 
we love this holiday ;  we load the table with dishes ,  we make sweetened wheat sprouts and wheat-and-mutton stew  ,  azimov said . 
but the delay in payment of pensions and government workers salaries ,  the mandatory donations exacted from entrepreneurs and farmers - thats the price we pay every year for novruz . 
the celebration isnt limited to citizens . 
national governments and international bodies also mark the holiday . 
this year the un general assembly recognised march <num>21</num>  as the international day of novruz . 
in <num>2009</num>  novruz entered the unesco representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity . 
this will be the first year that kazakhstan celebrates novruz officially ,  where march <num>20</num> -<num>24</num>  will be official holidays . 
the celebration also continues until march <num>24</num>  in uzbekistan but goes until march <num>25</num>  in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan . 
turkmenistan will have a relatively modest celebration ,  march <num>21</num> -<num>22</num>  .
in uzbekistan ,  the government declared the month before novruz a community work month to improve public amenities and green spaces . 
at that time ,  citizens carried out a national khashar ,  cleaning streets ,  building facades ,  places of worship and cemeteries ;  and planting fruit and ornamental trees . 
the palace of youth creativity is hosting the landscapes of our homeland art exhibition during novruz . 
the timing and location of the main tashkent concert will remain a secret until the last moment . 
that concert will take place in one of the capitals squares march <num>21</num>  with president islam karimov present . 
as with any party ,  celebrations dont come cheap . 
the cost of staging novruz festivities will be covered by local governmental budgets ,  businesses and various  ( charitable )  funds ,  stated the press service of uzbek prime minister shavkat mirziyoyev . 
donations might not have been voluntary . 
according to witnesses ,  a month before the holiday ,  district governments in tashkent convened local entrepreneurs and asked them to give <num>300,000</num>  uzs each  ( us <num>141</num>  $  )  for greening the city . 
bishkeks old square will host a concert ,  along with an improvised sports area for budo karate ,  tae-kwon-do ,  wushu ,  kuresh wrestling ,  tugs-of-war ,  arm wrestling ,  ping-pong ,  mancala and chess . 
more concerts and sports will be held elsewhere in the city . 
in addition ,  the administration for trade ,  services and protection of consumer rights is organising temporary marketplaces in the high-rise residential districts of asanbai and dzhal and at the intersection of ivanitsyn and shopokov streets . 
osh is hosting the presidents cup of buzkashi and bakiyev plans to attend . 
tajikistan has also scheduled concerts and food distributions for the needy . 
kulob will witness the simultaneous circumcisions of <num>35</num>  boys . 
novruz festivities began march <num>19</num>  in dangar with the participation of the tajik and turkmen presidents . 
in honour of the holiday ,  contests in tajik national wrestling  ( gushtingiri )  took place . 
dushanbe will see its own gushtingiri contests march <num>21</num>  , as well as horse races in the hippodrome . 
the victors will receive shares in the rogun hydropower station . 
before novruz arrives in afghanistan ,  locals sew new clothes ,  rearrange the house and make a drink called haft mewa or haft seen by combining dried fruits in water . 
in the northern provinces ,  some celebrants grow wheat in special pots in order to make a dish called samanak . 
women use the long hours needed to prepare this dish to socialise . 
mustafa ,  <num>30</num>  , of afghanistan ,  feels optimistic about the coming year . 
jamil sharify ,  <num>23</num>  , urged the police and military to guarantee security nationwide ,  especially in mazari sharif . 
that city will see mela-e-gul surkh ,  the red flower of the new year celebration . 
unfortunately ,  the celebration has become a target of non-revellers . 
march <num>17</num>  the national security administration in the northern afghan province of balkh announced that it had detained five suspects in connection with charges of plotting terrorist attacks . 
the five allegedly planned terrorist acts during novruz celebrations in mazari sharif . 
i am optimistic that many people will go out and celebrate this occasion ,  but still there is fear of suicide attacks ,  mostly in the southern cities … and even in kabul . 
shrinking number of tajik artisans crafts stringed instruments
stringed-instrument maker mirzo nurov shows off a dombra that is more than <num>100</num>  years old . 
he says interest in making traditional instruments has dwindled . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe - you hear the captivating sound of tajik stringed instruments at weddings ,  birthday parties and other celebrations . 
tajik virtuosos draw out all the sounds of nature - the babbling mountain brook ,  the morning song of the nightingale ,  the rustle of leaves - from the dombra ,  rubob and dutar . 
men pass down the skill of making these two- and three-stringed instruments from generation to generation . 
i have been doing this for <num>37</num>  years now . 
slowly plucking the strings of a two-stringed dombra ,  he demonstrates its sound . 
nobody can make a true instrument if he cannot play it ,  nurov said . 
the first time i picked up a rubob i was <num>12</num>  years old . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>   ( my uncle )  became my first music teacher ,  the master craftsman remembered . 
then there was the music college and professional instructors . 
instrument making became his passion . 
he dropped out of the university after only a few months ,  he remembered . 
nurov is always the most esteemed guest at weddings in nearby neighbourhoods . 
often ,  foreign guests come to his studio to hear the usto  ( master )  . 
he uses only three types of wood for his stringed instruments :  mulberry ,  walnut and apricot ,  he said . 
each instrument requires three to six months to make ,  and wood is moody ,  he said . 
the most important task is to dry the resonator <abbr>…</abbr>  for several months under natural conditions . 
if my sons themselves had not wanted to study how to make the instruments ,  my trade would be lost ,  he said . 
but my grandchildren have not shown much interest so far ,  nurov said . 
the demand for such instruments also has fallen ,  nurov said . 
all of our masters ,  who are renowned not only in the country but also abroad ,  can be found at the soztarosh factory ,  nurov said . 
before ,  work here was in full swing ;  now the orders are smaller . 
contemporary musicians are more drawn to brass and electric instruments . 
musicians revere him for his ability to restore decrepit instruments to their previous sound . 
 " i even come across some fairly valuable rarities "  . 
society's attitudes toward traditional instruments have changed with the times ,  nurov and alibekov conceded . 
but they express confidence that an appreciation for folk music and the instruments one needs to play it will always exist . 
tajikistan bans film nasha russia :  yaitsa sudby
tajikistan banned the sale of copies of the film nasha russia ,  saying that it portrays tajiks in a negative light . 
critics retort that the ban wont solve the problem . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe -- a rich muscovite hires ravshan and jamshud to do some repair work . 
the apartment owner tells them he expects a good job . 
so tajikistan has banned the sale of copies of the film nasha russia :  yaitsa sudby and all <num>63</num>  episodes of the show nasha russia . 
but the ban hasnt stopped vendors from selling the popular videos . 
akhbar sharipov ,  director of the licensing department of audiovisual products at the state-owned tochikkino ,  said that a committee of experts on audiovisual productions recommended the ban . 
it consists entirely of mockery of migrant workers ,  he said in defence of the ban . 
the manufacturing and distribution of media productions and the showing of films and videos containing <abbr>…</abbr>  material aimed at inciting social ,  racial ,  ethnic or religious strife or exalting cruelty ,  violence and pornography are banned ,  tolib kholov ,  director of the tajik committee for television and radio ,  said . 
tajiks are debating whether nasha russia incites strife . 
yartsev recognises ,  though ,  that tv programmes can influence public opinion :  more than once i have witnessed muscovites turn to migrant workers who look like natives of central asia and call them ravshan or jamshud . 
this leads to one conclusion :  the image of these comedy leads has firmly lodged itself in the minds of many russians . 
after watching the film ,  tajik journalist vera kulakova wasnt buying the assurances of the filmmakers . 
all the leads are generalised characters . 
but that ambiguity is said to be a recent change . 
only now have ravshan and jamshud become generalised characters ;  before ,  it was plainly stated that they were migrant workers from tajikistan ,  said tajik political analyst parviz mullojanov ,  who resents what he says is the films insulting tone . 
no fan of the film ,  he doubts the ban will accomplish much . 
anyone can watch the movie by downloading it from the internet ,  mullojanov stated . 
the ban is part of a broader mission ,  khikmatullo saifullozoda ,  director of the islamic renaissance party analytical department ,  said . 
protecting migrants rights is the primary responsibility of the authorities ,  but this needs to be done by protecting migrants honour as well ,  he said . 
our government simply lacked other means to influence the situation besides the ban . 
after the criticism in the newspapers ,  i watched the film yaitsa sudby myself ,  but did not see anything so terrible <abbr>…</abbr>  except uninteresting ,  black humour ,  said dushanbe resident malika sabzaliyeva . 
she said some of the humour might be based on how some real migrants behave . 
she once saw one migrant worker on a moscow-bound plane wipe his shoes on a headrest cover . 
karomat sharipov ,  chairman of the russian organisation tajikskie trudovye migranty  ( ttm  [ tajik migrant workers ]  )  ,  noted in an interview with russian media that nasha russia mocks the tajik passport and intentionally shows the  ( passport's )  national crest in doing so "  . 
sharipov was referring to a scene where ravshan and jamshud buried their tajik passports . 
ttm complained in writing to the prosecutor-general of russia and the board of directors at comedy club productions ,  which produces nasha russia ,  he said . 
iran arrests more than <num>200</num>  in student protests
the turnout ,  fueled by students marching by the thousands on more than a dozen campuses around the country ,  showed that months of arrests and government intimidation had failed to stamp out the movement sparked by the disputed presidential election in june . 
from today ,  no leniency will be applied .  " 
black flags will be raised over the club ,  and protest rallies will be held during the mourning period . 
tehreek-e-taliban  ( ttp )  military commander ,  wali rehman mehsud ,  in a media interview last week ,  claimed that the ongoing military operation in the mehsud territory of south waziristan had not impacted the militants and his organization is fully intact . 
they  ( the militants )  have been expelled and now are on the run ,  he said . 
the militants are on the run and have no place to hide but are talking about sending forces to afghanistan . 
there is no coherence in his claims and they are self-contradictory ,  abbas said . 
for dilafruz and a group of other parents in southern kyrgyzstan ,  the ostracism comes through no fault of their children or themselves . 
the operation is expected to involve up to <num>15,000</num>  personnel in all and will continue for six to eight weeks . 
the ministry of health registered <num>97</num>  cases of maternal mortality in <num>2009</num>  , up from <num>71</num>  in <num>2008</num>  .
she says that doctors are not always fulfilling their duties faithfully . 
some critics are warning that aggressive pursuit of members of banned groups could backfire . 
on february <num>22</num>  , the election observation mission from the organisation for security and co-operation in europe  ( osce )  issued a report that said several political parties complained of police interference during the campaign and the use of government resources by the ndpt . 
we are told that the complaints have been taken into consideration ,  but nothing has changed ,  said kudratov . 
the civil war in tajikistan was not their initiative ,  he said . 
starting next school year ,  islamic culture will be taught in all tajik schools in tajikistan ,  and the government plans to include it in the kyrgyz ,  uzbek and russian schools program as well . 
 [ nematullo mirsaidov ] 
khujand - radical islam has tajikistans educators worried . 
beginning with the new school year ,  secondary school students in tajikistan will begin studying islam from textbooks that scholars expressly wrote for this purpose . 
the new subject is intended to protect the younger generation from outside ideas of terrorism and extremism  ( promoted by )  extremist religious movements ,  said bibihavo sharopova ,  head of the ministry of educations office of preschool and school general education . 
that lack of course materials forced teachers to select their own for the subject ,  guided by the ministry of educations publication ,  the guide for teachers of islamic culture . 
the ministry cites an inflow of radicals bent on establishing a caliphate in central asia as the reason it needed a new textbook on islam . 
extremist religious organisations intensifying their activities in central asia can instantly fill any gap in ideological education ,  sharopova said . 
until <num>2009</num>  , tajikistans public schools taught the history of religions - a course developed in soviet times . 
over the past two decades the world has changed so much that scholars have not kept pace in adding to and changing the humanities ,  said tajik national academy of sciences member jurabek nazriev . 
the global socialist system collapsed ,  and all sorts of extremist religious movements entered the political arena ,  promoting their ideas under the banner of islam ,  nazriev said . 
such circumstances confuse not only the young but also modern politicians . 
extremist views encouraged by an improper interpretation of islam lead to repression in central asia ,  he said . 
in order to somehow change the situation ,  it is necessary to have a … boundary between traditional islam and the teachings that have emerged as a result of attempts to restore the muslim religion ,  nazriev added . 
unfortunately ,  the countrys ministry of education does not have any idea  ( how to create this boundary )  . 
and the proposed course of study of islam is just the response to the head of states instructions . 
however ,  he argued that one class per week is insufficient to protect youth from reactionary trends . 
mostly muslims live in the territory of central asia . 
uzbeks ,  tajiks ,  turkmen ,  kazakhs and kyrgyz are peoples of one faith ,  and they are required to have at least a general idea about their religion ,  he said . 
the head of the russian cultural centre in chkalov ,  which is home to more than <num>20</num>  ethnic minorities ,  says it is necessary to study the history of all religions . 
it would have been fair to introduce the history of religions as a subject in russian schools and to give equal class time to islam and christianity . 
the compilers of the textbook need to be especially delicate in their approach to this issue ,  not forgetting the freedom of conscience prescribed in the countrys constitution . 
one of the authors of the new textbook ,  said ahmadov ,  ph . d .  ,  said that introducing islamic culture as a subject in kyrgyz and uzbek schools shouldnt cause problems in terms of compliance with legislation or protection of the countrys kyrgyz and uzbek minorities . 
at this early stage ,  the ministry of education has decided to introduce the courses only in the upper grades of tajik-language schools . 
however ,  in the future it plans to introduce the subject into uzbek ,  kyrgyz and russian-language schools as well . 
drug-resistant form of tb spreading to remote kyrgyz villages
osh ,  kyrgyzstan - a new <num>50</num> -bed unit has opened in the osh oblast anti-tb centre to treat patients suffering from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis . 
it is the only hospital in southern kyrgyzstan that treats the disease . 
with power supply disruptions being fairly frequent in southern kyrgyzstan ,  it is essential that electricity and water supplies to our laboratory remain uninterrupted ,  senior nurse gulnara sagynbayeva said . 
that will enable us to identify tb cases in good time and to scan the test samples we receive from various districts with a high tb incidence . 
but one tb specialist ,  speaking on condition of anonymity ,  said the centres per capita spending on food  ( kgs <num>87.5</num>  / us <num>1.95</num>  $  per day )  and drugs  ( kgs <num>52</num>  / us <num>1.16</num>  $  per day )  is insufficient to meet demand . 
the patients need to be given anti-tb drugs in concert with medicines to treat accompanying illnesses ;  we also must be sure that the  ( multidrug-resistant )  tb patients ,  especially those who are in prison ,  are fed well ,  he said . 
matkasym isakulov ,  <num>42</num>  , from a remote village in alai district ,  osh oblast ,  is one of the centres patients . 
when i turned for assistance to the hospital in the district centre of gulcha ,  they gave me some pills that somehow did not help . 
isakulovs condition worsened and local tb specialists directed him to osh for treatment . 
doctors there diagnosed him as having a resistant strain of tb . 
she said test samples come to her laboratory from all tb clinics across southern kyrgyzstan ,  because they lack the ability to identify the resistant strain of tb . 
likhoded said the resistant strain of tb is very difficult to treat and carries the risk of incurability . 
im afraid i may have infected my family - my wife and three kids ,  he said . 
now my relatives need to be examined for potential infection ,  too ,  or i will never forgive myself . 
 ( multidrug-resistant )  tb patients are compelled to take six or seven pills as a one-time dose and to continue that course of treatment for a long time ,  gegam petrosyan ,  the medical delegate to the international red cross mission in kyrgyzstan ,  told central asia online . 
according to avtandil alisherov ,  director of the national phthisiology centre ,  the most common treatment for resistant tb is ofloxacin . 
a bottle of that costs kgs <num>300</num>   ( us <num>6.69</num>  $  )  for a two-year treatment for one patient . 
other medicines cost a total of us <num>9,000</num>  $ -<num>13,000</num>  $  per year and are co-financed by the global fund to fight aids ,  tuberculosis and malaria and other international organisations . 
petrosyan said the red cross is concerned that many discharged prisoners return to ordinary life without completing treatment . 
therefore ,  we think it is important to strengthen ties between the penal system and the kyrgyz health ministrys national tb programme ,  which has already resulted in the renovation of the osh laboratory ,  he said . 
of the <num>7,500</num>  prisoners in kyrgyzstan ,  about <num>350</num>   ( <num>5</num>  %  )  are prone to tb infection . 
according to her ,  the failure of former inmates to eat well after their release seriously undermines their health . 
in addition ,  those who backslide seldom seek proper attention . 
we have tried to register and monitor the tb patients  ( with the resistant strain )  who are out of prison ,  rakhima gainazarova ,  the red cross representative in osh ,  said . 
the group monitors <num>40</num>  people in osh ,  supplying them with food and medicine . 
likhoded said osh oblast has other tb treatment centres - a <num>30</num> -bed hospital in gulcha ,  another with <num>80</num>  beds in karasuu and a <num>150</num> -bed clinic for children . 
district centres have hospitals that can treat ordinary tb but are helpless in the face of the resistant strain . 
there are <num>5,335</num>  registered tb patients throughout the country ,  of whom <num>3,111</num>  are inpatients . 
of the <num>1,290</num>  with the resistant strain ,  <num>97</num>  are in prison . 
according to the health ministry press service ,  the number of tb infections identified in <num>2009</num>  was down <num>1</num>  %  from <num>2008</num>  .
while kyrgyzstan is making progress in its fight against tb ,  the world health organizations online database says the country-wide incidence of tb was <num>121</num>  cases per <num>100,000</num>  residents in <num>2007</num>  , the last year listed in the database . 
that level ,  and osh oblasts <num>2009</num>  rate of <num>101.3</num>  cases per <num>100,000</num>  residents ,  are more than double the <num>50</num>  cases per <num>100,000</num>  people the world health organization defines as an epidemic . 
suicide on rise in tajikistan
dushanbe - domestic abuse and a lack of jobs and money are causing more and more tajiks to take their own lives . 
current interior ministry statistics put the incidence of suicide nationwide in tajikistan at about <num>7</num>  cases per <num>100,000</num>  residents . 
over the years the numbers have fluctuated ;  in <num>1985</num>  the world health organization reported the highest incidence in recent years :  <num>8</num>  men and <num>3.9</num>  women per <num>100,000</num>  , while in <num>2005</num>  the incidence was only <num>2.9</num>  men and <num>2.3</num>  women per <num>100,000</num>  people . 
but many officials dont trust the numbers . 
these figures ,  fail to truly reflect the actual situation ,  saodat tyuryayeva ,  senior special investigator with the interior ministrys investigative department ,  told central asia online . 
she said too often relatives of suicide victims fail to report the death as a suicide because the act is considered a disgrace to the family . 
lieut-colonel lola otabayeva ,  a police department division chief ,  agrees that relatives often misreport suicides as fatal accidents because suicides are judged not just by religion but by society . 
sogd oblast ranked first among the countrys oblasts last year with <num>260</num>  suicides  ( three more than in <num>2008</num>  )  ,  according to the interior ministry . 
gulsifat suffered from her husbands unfaithfulness . 
she poured kerosene on herself and set herself on fire ,  burning about <num>35</num>  percent of her body ,  with her face suffering major damage . 
she returned to live with her parents but now avoids meeting relatives and friends . 
gulsifat said she has to wear sunglasses and a wig even in wintertime . 
according to one suicide scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity ,  yet another woman ,  <num>18</num> -year-old mairamgul ,  committed suicide because on her wedding day her bridegroom failed to discover the evidence of her chastity and returned her to her parents . 
the despondent bride set herself on fire in a barn . 
doctors could not save her life . 
zebo sharifova ,  executive director of the league of women lawyers ,  said one reason for womens self-immolations is domestic violence . 
other reasons ,  sharifova said ,  are poverty and unemployment . 
suicide is not only prevalent among women ,  but often desperate men who are unable to earn money to support their families take their own lives sharifova said . 
sakhiba is a mother of three nearly grown children . 
the suicide expert who asked to remain anonymous said demographic aspects contribute to the suicide issue . 
these include big families ,  which lead to poverty and malnutrition . 
women resort to self-immolation in the hope that other people will interfere and save them ,  after all . 
they just dont realise it is impossible to put out the fire instantly ,  the expert said . 
davron mukhmaediyev ,  author of the book womens self-immolation in extreme psycho-traumatic situations ,  conducted clinical-psychopathological testing of <num>21</num>  women who had attempted self-immolation during the civil war . 
he found that the patients thought it necessary to commit suicide because they felt unable to defend their families and children against violence . 
some use suicide as a threat . 
in response ,  mokhsharif tied a length of rope around her neck and threatened to hang herself . 
ever since then ,  her neighbours have avoided her ,  and did not disagree with her on anything for fear she might do something rash… currently ,  mokhsharif lives with her husband and has had a baby ,  but people keep pointing at her as the one who hanged herself . 
djumakhonova said others threaten suicide to make family members feel guilty . 
scholars say there is a need to expand the network of crisis centres and shelters that offer moral ,  psychological and legal assistance . 
we need to take preventive measures ,  otabayeva said . 
someone knowing that his or her problems are soluble is unlikely to commit suicide . 
but creating such centres is not the only hurdle . 
getting people to overcome tradition and accept counselling is also part of the problem . 
i wish visits to the psychologist were as widely practiced in tajikistan as they are in the west ,  djumakhonova said . 
that would slash the suicide rate substantially . 
kazakh regions lag in economic development

while astana and almaty are managing the economic crisis relatively well ,  the rest of the country is struggling  [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
musurmankulova  ,  a freshman studying electronics and telecommunications at eurasian national university in astana ,  moved from the provincial town of schuchinsk . 
her father works for the railway ,  earning about kzt <num>45,000</num>   ( us <num>300</num>  $  )  monthly ,  while her mother lost her job to banking-sector layoffs . 
she has seen the hardships endured by her parents and the lack of opportunity in the regions . 
in case i cant go to almaty ,  i will stay in astana ,  because at least its the capital ,  she said . 
according to economic analysts ,  astana and almaty are weathering the economic crisis because they are the centres of political and economic power - and because they receive a disproportionate share of the national budget . 
zhanibek khassan ,  an independent economist from almaty ,  said that in <num>2009</num>  almaty and astana received <num>13.6</num>  %  and <num>11.9</num>  %  ,  respectively ,  of the kzt <num>256</num>  billion  ( us <num>1.7</num>  $  billion )  national budget . 
the remaining <num>74.5</num>  %  went to <num>14</num>  kazakh regions ,  where the majority of the countrys population lives . 
that means while the government spent kzt <num>45,000</num>   ( us <num>300</num>  $  )  and kzt <num>25,000</num>   ( us <num>167</num>  $  )  per capita in astana and almaty ,  it spent only kzt <num>13,500</num>   ( us <num>90</num>  $  )  per capita in the rest of the country . 
spending on social programs such as healthcare ,  education ,  social security ,  transport ,  and communication differs significantly when one considers funding for the capital cities and that for the regions ,  khassan said . 
with many jobs located in the major cities ,  internal migration in kazakhstan is growing . 
many are moving to astana and almaty to pursue those jobs ,  according to the nonprofit group shanyrak-kazakhstan . 
according to the ministry of economy and budget planning ,  in order to solve the problem of growth in the big cities ,  the government plans to build satellite cities - koshi for astana and g4 city for almaty . 
esen esetgaraev ,  a political scientist from karaganda state university ,  said the country inherited a highly centralised system of governance from the soviet union . 
that system ends up privileging the centre ,  the former and current capitals . 
sarimov said the kazakh public too often is interested only in the narrowest definition of regional governance :  the identities of those taking regional governorships and other appointed positions . 
the president ,  rather than voters ,  names those governors . 
kirill osin from the nonprofit ecomangistau agreed with sarimov that the idea of regional development is immature in kazakhstan . 
the state of the regional development agenda in kazakhstan is also faulted by economists . 
efforts by the government to foster regional development come from the top down ,  said tatyana pritvorova ,  an economist at the institute of regional development in karaganda . 
in <num>2006</num>  , the european bank for reconstruction and development defined regional disparities in kazakhstan as a systemic problem that could halt the countrys development . 
kazakhstan subsequently adopted a strategy on regional development ,  but critics say the country implemented the strategy poorly . 
more recently ,  to try to create new jobs in the regions ,  the ministry of labour launched a programme ,  dorozhnaya karta ,  for those who lost their jobs in the economic crisis . 
the program creates jobs in the infrastructure sector for the unemployed as well as offering re-training . 
according to the ministry of economy and budget planning ,  in order to foster a balance between the regions and the capitals ,  the government is creating regional development agencies . 
in <num>2009</num>  such agencies opened in the akmoli and mangistau oblasts . 
these centres research the oblast economy ,  identify needs and give the central government advice on what steps to take to improve the local economy . 
but at this point ,  there is scepticism that the central government in astana is ready to give the regions what they need to develop . 
oleg metsik ,  an astana-based economist at turan-profi university ,  said the government is likely to continue appointing bureaucrats loyal to astana ,  rather than the professionals it needs to direct regional development . 
 " there is no region  ( in our country )  with an action model that can lead to achieving the region's goals "  ,  he said .

the community-based infrastructure services project was approved by the adb in june <num>2000</num>  .
it was to have been wound up in december <num>2006</num>  but ,  thanks to its implementation lagging two years behind schedule ,  has been extended to <abbr>dec.</abbr>

kazakh-russian-belarusian customs union bursting at seams

kyrgyzstan wants to become a member of the customs union of russia ,  belarus and kazakhstan ,  but the countrys membership in wto may be a trouble for that  [ aynur asanova ] 
astana - kyrgyz officials and analysts differ on whether joining a new customs union will be worth it . 
as the year started ,  the customs union of russia ,  belarus and kazakhstan became operational . 
kyrgyzstan is considering joining it ,  but some kazakh observers say the union has created new problems instead of solving old ones . 
the unions website stated its goal is the removal of economic restrictions between the three countries ,  the elimination of customs duties ,  the imposition of uniform duties for external borders and the creation of a single economic space and a single currency . 
the customs services were not able to comply with all the regulations ,  so now its a mess ,  said kazakh economist kanat berentayev . 
not all issues have been resolved with the adoption of the customs code . 
several kazakh observers said inflation was the most visible fruit of the new union . 
kazakhstans market has already reacted to the union . 
prices on imported food products and goods for general consumption as well as those on automobiles have soared ,  said a kazakh ministry of economic affairs and budget planning analyst who asked for anonymity . 
kazakh minister of industry and trade aset isekeshev said ,  in connection with  ( entering the union )  ,   ( our )  average custom duties increased from <num>6.2</num>  %  to <num>10.6</num>  %  . 
prices of goods imported from outside the union countries have increased <num>50</num>  %  ,  said kazakh trade union commission for market goods chairwoman yelena leonidova . 
new ,  precise numbers for the duties have not been set ,  plus customs officers exploiting the confusion are trying to get their piece ,  said the anonymous analyst from the ministry of economic affairs and budget planning . 
everything is turning out worse than expected . 
over the past two months ,  the volume of trade  ( among the customs union members )  has not increased significantly ,  and our trade with other countries is shrinking . 
so far ,  the kyrgyz government professes to be undiscouraged by that news coming from its neighbour . 
kyrgyzstan will soon consider the possibility of joining the union ,  said kyrgyz prime minister daniyar usenov . 
kyrgyzstan - which joined the wto ,  unlike the unions three members - is hearing numerous voices urging it to become the unions fourth country . 
we need to scramble to join  ( the union )  ,  said bazarbai mambetov ,  a former deputy prime minister . 
he said <num>45</num>  %  of kyrgyzstans foreign trade is with russia and kazakhstan . 
kyrgyzstan has reason for great concern ,  said the anonymous kazakh ministry of economic affairs analyst . 
it is vulnerable to high duties on its exports to russia and kazakhstan if it remains outside the union ,  the kazakh said . 
an obstacle for bishkek ,  though ,  is russian anti-kyrgyz sentiment ,  according to members of the kyrgyz opposition . 
the kremlin has made no secret of its displeasure over the continued american presence at the manas air force base and over alleged misuse of russian aid meant to help finance the kambarat-1 hydropower project . 
russian president dmitry medvedev said <abbr>…</abbr>  he is not yet considering admitting kyrgyzstan and tajikistan into the union ,  abdygany erkebayev ,  an opposition politician who heads the public parliament  ( obshchestvenny parliament )  non-profit organisation . 
he also said he would be watching the behaviour of kyrgyzstans leadership <abbr>…</abbr>  not quite diplomatic . 
kyrgyz foreign and domestic policies are contrary to russian policy ,  said isa omurkulov ,  a parliamentary deputy from the opposition social democratic party . 
naturally ,  russia will react with distrust . 
but not everybody said the kremlin will blackball bishkek . 
i think our neighbours will <abbr>…</abbr>  admit us because allies such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are also necessary ,  said bishkek-based political analyst toktogul kakchekeyev . 
they define the external borders of the cis . 
countries in russias position will take into account only economic interests and not policy differences when weighing whether to admit another member ,  said mambetov .

kyrgyz vendors say their chinese counterparts sell their goods almost for free . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
kara-suu ,  kyrgyzstan -- kyrgyzstan has a love-hate relationship with the arrival of chinese business people . 
on the one hand ,  if it hadnt been for cheap chinese goods ,  i dont think we would have survived the first years of independence ,  said damir kochkorov ,  director of a bishkek company . 
if someone closed his eyes and just listened ,  it would not sound like a problem . 
but when one opens his eyes at the dordoi market near bishkek and the kara-suu market ,  one sees that much of the business is linked to importers of chinese goods . 
the dividing line for opinions on this so-called chinese invasion is starkly drawn . 
kyrgyz competitors are irate ,  while vendors of chinese merchandise view the growing chinese economic presence as benign . 
chinese traders at the kara-suu market refused to comment . 
more than <num>300</num>  sino-kyrgyz joint enterprises now operate in kyrgyzstan . 
they include the kyzyl-kyia cement factory ,  the construction firm working on the international osh-sary-tash-erkechtam highway ,  a manufacturer of small aircraft ,  and a construction firm working on seven hydropower stations and modernising the tamchy airport in issyk-kul . 
any company that enters the kyrgyz market must comply with regulations when hiring personnel ,  said aigul ryskulova ,  kyrgyz minister of labour ,  employment and migration . 
even if the investor is a major company ,  we demand that <num>80</num>  percent of the personnel are kyrgyz citizens . 
in <num>2008</num>  , a member of the zhogorku kenesh  ( parliament )  from the ak zhol presidential party ,  beishenbek abdrasakov ,  said ,  if we dont stop the creeping migration of chinese to kyrgyzstan ,  after ten to <num>15</num>  years ,  the entire local market will consist of chinese products . 
china is interested in developing projects in kyrgyzstans uranium ,  chemical ,  mining and light industries ,  according to the kyrgyz ministry of trade and industry . 
in <num>2009</num>  , china -- second only to russia -- produced <num>13.6</num>  %  of the goods and services kyrgyzstan imported ,  according to the kyrgyz ministry of trade and industry ;  conversely ,  china is not one of the five largest customers for kyrgyz exports . 
but statistics cannot capture the true extent of kyrgyz-chinese trade ,  said bishkek-based political analyst mars sariev . 
a major part of the goods passing through the chinese-kyrgyz border goes through illegally ,  he said . 
more visible to the average bystander than investments in infrastructure are the ubiquitous cheap goods -clothes ,  toys and hardware -that fill kyrgyz markets . 
with chinas increasing presence in kyrgyz business ,  concern is growing that kyrgyzstan may be regressing into colonial status because chinese investment is tantamount to control of the infrastructure . 
indeed ,  sometimes such partnerships even benefit kyrgyzstan . 
one example of that is the planned chinese-kyrgyz-uzbek railway ,  which would bind kyrgyzstan more closely to china . 
the cost of the kyrgyz portion is estimated at us <num>2</num>  $  billion . 
potential benefits for kyrgyzstan are sizable ,  as reported by the eurasia daily monitor ,  since the railway would link the naryn and osh oblasts and maybe even serve issyk-kul ,  a scenic lake that lacks a railway to bring in tourists . 
kyrgyzstan stands to collect transit fees on cargo ,  too . 
the question of how kyrgyzstan intends to pay china to build the kyrgyz segment is a sensitive one ,  with some fearing chinese domination of the countrys natural resources . 
one reported offer by kyrgyzstan was to let china obtain control of a naryn coal mine . 
other central asian nations have had sinophobic reactions to perceived chinese economic encroachment . 
for example ,  a crowd of kazakhs demonstrated in january in almaty at the prospect of leasing farmland to the chinese . 
other countries with an economic stake in kyrgyzstan reportedly have reason to worry about the flowering of sino-kyrgyz trade . 
the kremlin reportedly dislikes the prospect of beijing gaining influence within a former soviet republic but has not objected publicly . 
the kazakhs would see their own rail link to china lose importance if the chinese-kyrgyz-uzbek railway is built ,  said sariev . 
build that railway ,  and kyrgyzstan will fall under the chinese umbrella ,  sariev warned . 
kyrgyz military analysts suggest unorthodox ways to attain regional security

the countrys small population has some considering swiss-style neutrality to ensure its security . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
having only a conscription-based military of just <num>7,000</num>  troops and a population of <num>5.2</num>  meter  ,  the government is looking for ways other than armed might to defend itself . 
by comparison ,  neighbouring armed forces dwarf kyrgyzstans :  china stations <num>220,000</num>  soldiers in a single region . 
uzbekistan has <num>70,000</num>  troops . 
even the next smallest regional military ,  tajikistans ,  has <num>12,000</num>  troops . 
service-dodging men can pay a <num>12,000</num>  kgs  ( us <num>267</num>  $  )  bribe to race through boot camp in two weeks and free themselves from their obligation ,  complained reserve colonel toktogul kakchekeyev . 
facts like those have president kurmanbek bakiyev searching for answers . 
lately ,  he has emphasised a reduction in numbers and professionalization of the armed forces . 
on march <num>18</num>  in osh ,  where the countrys first professional military unit began deployment ,  he said ,  well-trained professionals ,  not <num>18</num> - and <num>19</num> -year-old boys ,  should be serving in the military . 
he has also called for new thinking ,  saying last september that the country needed a military doctrine . 
last spring ,  he said the country should rely on international co-operation and diplomacy ,  not just force ,  to guarantee security . 
the president is trying to create the most complete military-strategic code possible ,  the analyst said ,  one that would defend kyrgyzstan even <num>20</num>  years from now . 
perhaps the most drastic suggestion is one advanced by kyrgyz national university associate professor marat suyunbayev :  abolish the defence ministry and declare partial neutrality . 
given its size ,  the kyrgyz army would be helpless in the face of a serious attack ,  suyunbayev said . 
instead ,  he said ,  bishkek should disband the standing army while retaining border guards ,  interior ministry forces and intelligence agencies . 
those remaining forces ,  in his view ,  could take care of extremist threats ,  while a neutral diplomatic stance would make the country a demilitarised state in a militarised territory ,  he argued . 
if the government decided to abolish its military ,  it would save money . 
first deputy defence minister marat kenzhesariyev told parliament it costs <num>90,000</num>  kgs  ( us <num>2,000</num>  $  )  annually to station one soldier in the field . 
one tajik refugee agreed with suyunbayevs thoughts on neutrality . 
bobojon  ( who refused to give his last name )  ,  a businessman who fled tajikistan during its <num>1992</num> -<num>1997</num>  civil war and resettled in bishkek ,  said ,   ( tajiks )  should have followed turkmenistans example of announcing neutrality . 
then there would not have been a  ( civil )  war . 
but critics argue that the country would endanger its security by declaring neutrality . 
force is the only true weapon against militants and extremists ,  kakchekeyev said . 
our soldiers year after year demonstrate they can destroy the small ,  religiously instructed gangs . 
large-scale invasions like  ( the influx of islamic movement of uzbekistan extremists )  in <num>1999</num>  are not foreseen in the coming years . 
the country needs a guarantor of its security if it decides to declare neutrality ,  said kyrgyz-russian slavic university political scientist marat kazakpayev . 
presently ,  not even russia can take on such obligations ,  he warned . 
a senior defence ministry official ,  who asked to remain anonymous ,  said international obligations might compel the country to retain its military . 
kyrgyzstan belongs to the collective security treaty organisation and the shanghai co-operation organisation  ( sco )  . 
foreign troops have access to its bases . 
we would have to exit all alliances that signify military co-operation with specific countries ,  kazakpayev said . 
citing the relatively early stages of the military reform debate ,  neither the defence ministry nor international organisations have commented on the various proposals . 
the public ,  however ,  is showing a willingness to part with the traditional idea of fielding a standing army . 
in mid-february ,  channel <num>5</num>  tv polled its viewers on using unorthodox methods to protect kyrgyzstan . 
of <num>1,800</num>  respondents ,  <num>1,100</num>  favoured experimentation . 
visa regime and bad service hinder uzbek tourism
tourists near the hazrat imam bukhari tomb in samarkand . 
uzbek analysts say the country has potential to draw more tourists . 
 [ amjad bashir siddiqi ] 
tashkent - with the onset of spring ,  tourism in uzbekistan has increased . 
according to the world trade organisation  ( wto )  ,  about <num>1</num>  meter  tourists visit the country annually . 
analysts ,  however ,  say the country could draw many more tourists . 
the country doesnt lack lodging . 
a representative from uzbektourism said <num>279</num>  hotels provide <num>18,284</num>  rooms . 
they include international chains like intercontinental ,  radisson and sas . 
three mini-hotels opened just last year . 
nor is there a lack of travel agents and transportation . 
uzbekistan has <num>610</num>  travel agencies within its borders ,  and tourists can catch nonstop flights to tashkent from major international cities such as new york ,  buenos aires and kuala lumpur . 
the country has more than <num>7,000</num>  architectural and artistic monuments from different epochs and civilisations ,  many of which are included on the unescos world heritage list . 
but despite the infrastructure ,  tourism accounts for just <num>0.6</num>  %  percent of the countrys gdp ,  according to uzbektourism and the state statistics committee . 
in contrast ,  tourism accounts for <num>1.8</num>  %  of kyrgyz gdp and about <num>7</num> -<num>9</num>  %  of gdp in developed countries . 
but tourists find various barriers thwarting their desire to visit the land of samarkand and bukhara . 
three problems trample down potential tourists desire to visit uzbekistan :  the difficulty of obtaining visas ,  travel agencies offering only group tours ,  and poor service ,  said an employee in the consular section of an embassy in tashkent who asked to remain anonymous . 
an anonymous source in the uzbek foreign ministry said the government has good reason to reject some visa applications . 
but difficulties are not limited to obtaining a visa alone . 
tashkent international airport can be a hostile experience for those accustomed to cheerier portals elsewhere . 
in order to go through passport control ,  i had to stand in line for more than an hour ,  and it was the same for customs ,  complained german businessman christophe polonski of his experience at that airport . 
the airport has only three regularly staffed control points ,  one of which is solely for uzbeks . 
overall ,  the airport is shorthanded ,  in part because job applicants have to pay a bribe of us <num>500</num>  $ -<num>5,000</num>  $  , said an employee speaking on condition of anonymity . 
the bribe pays off soon enough ,  since employees can demand bribes all over the facility ,  the employee said . 
even though i was flying first class ,  i had to pay a porter to find and carry my baggage ,  one passenger said . 
one tourist-agency employee faulted the countrys underdeveloped domestic transportation infrastructure . 
the state airline ,  uzbekistan airways ,  does have nonstop flights to samarkand ,  bukhara and khiva . 
however ,  buses and trains ,  which most travellers use ,  can be trying experiences . 
bakhtiar shamshiev ,  an employee at the unesco office in tashkent ,  said its hard to compete with other countries . 
we must take into account that most potential visitors use the internet to find out about the country ,  shamshiev said . 
unfortunately ,  this type of communication is not popular among the managers of most of the tourist companies and government institutions interested in developing tourism in uzbekistan . 
the tough climate tourists encounter has become a selection process ,  according to farhad rasulov ,  owner of a chain of mini-hotels . 
most business owners are beginning to place emphasis on personnel training and staff development ,  but the lack of qualified employees - including senior management - is largely felt ,  rasulov said . 
only major hotels and agencies can afford training that conforms to international standards . 
the government needs to improve tourisms regulatory framework ,  create attractive conditions for domestic and foreign investment and raise the level of training of industry personnel ,  said uzbektourism chairman zahid khakimov . 
in addition ,  uzbekistan still has no trademark that any person would  ( instantly )  associate with the country ,  khakimov said . 
tajik law enforcers said to torture suspects
human rights defender sergei romanov ,  left ,  talks to an alleged torture victim about his rights . 
human right activists and victims say a lack of professionalism in law enforcement leads to torture . 
 [ jamila sujud ] 
dushanbe - the police stormed into my apartment at midnight without any explanation and demanded my id ,  said dmitry ,  <num>45</num>  , who refused to give his last name . 
then they started beating me up . 
his horrified wife pleaded for them to stop . 
dmitry ,  a khujand resident ,  apparently has plenty of company in tajikistan . 
the absence of a law expressly prohibiting torture and the reluctance of victims to report brutal treatment have encouraged police mistreatment of detainees ,  human rights activists ,  and alleged torture ,  victims say . 
the world organisation against torture is one of several groups that point to the absence of a legal ban on the practise . 
after the police left ,  dmitry asked the league of women lawyers  ( lwl )  for help . 
the group complained to the khujand prosecutors office . 
the prosecutor later charged several officers with exceeding their authority . 
his story is not isolated . 
the league received <num>124</num>  complaints of alleged torture by police between january <num>2008</num>  and july <num>2009</num>  .
league executive director zebo sharifova said ,  police officers know little ,  if anything at all ,  about the international standards  ( of detainee treatment )  . 
tajik legislation fails to define the very notion of torture in a manner <abbr>…</abbr>  consistent with international standards ,  lawyer sergei romanov said . 
gulchekhra sharipova ,  an expert on torture issues ,  stressed the importance of training police . 
the organisation for security and co-operation in europe  ( osce )  office in tajikistan offers training courses for police ,  but few officers have taken those classes . 
the country cant afford compulsory training for police ,  said tajik ombudsman zarif alizoda . 
tatyana khatyukhina ,  a lawyer with the human rights centre in khujand ,  said ,  most often ,  police pressure detainees psychologically and torture them to make them admit guilt . 
matlob ,  a physician who refused to give her last name ,  had a run-in with police who accused her of taking bribes . 
they began searching her roughly in a hospital room ,  she said . 
she confessed falsely to taking bribes ,  she said ,  after police threatened that she might never see her children again . 
some officers even quit because of the rampant torture . 
i quit <abbr>…</abbr>  because i lacked the courage to resist them ,  said a former dushanbe-based police detective who asked to remain anonymous . 
those who suffer abuse often stay silent . 
a jailed suspect might be afraid to open up to a defence attorney ,  fearing even more abuse after the lawyer leaves . 
victims are reluctant to request assistance ,  even from human rights defence centres ,  doubting that they can really help ,  khatyukhina said . 
but the complaints to the prosecutor generals office have been left unaddressed ,  sharifova said . 
not every battle with the authorities ends in defeat for a torture victim . 
dmitry ,  of khujand ,  found a sympathetic prosecutor . 
and after <num>15</num> -year-old nodyrs parents complained to the league that three police officers had beaten him to force a confession to a jewellery theft ,  the dushanbe prosecutor sent the three officers to prison for two years each . 
the office of the human rights ombudsman ,  established in september <num>2009</num>  , has been trying to help victims . 
ombudsman zarif alizoda has received five complaints about suspects being tortured . 
many people still dont know what the ombudsmans work is all about ,  he said . 
official comments on the issue ,  other than normatovs assessment of moral torture ,  were not available . 
romanov pointed out that tajikistan has not yet endorsed the optional protocol to the convention against torture . 
introducing civil law procedures to regulate compensation to victims of torture and of other brutal treatment <abbr>…</abbr>  would help too ,  romanov said . 
trials of religious extremists sweep uzbekistan
a cage in a tashkent courtroom in november <num>2005</num>  holds <num>15</num>  defendants accused of terrorism ,  murder of government officials and other serious crimes during a may <num>2005</num>  demonstration in andijan . 
observers say <num>7,000</num> -<num>10,000</num>  uzbeks unjustly called terrorists and radicals are languishing in uzbek prisons . 
tashkent - the government calls them extremists ,  but human rights groups say they are victims of repression . 
there seems to be no middle ground in the characterisation of uzbek religious activists across the country who have been arrested or are being tried on charges of terrorism and assassination . 
according to the action group of independent human rights defenders ,  <num>29</num>  trials in the tashkent oblast alone have sent <num>83</num>  members of unregistered religious organisations to prison for <num>15</num> -to-18-year terms . 
another <num>100</num>  muslims are on trial in syrdarya oblast ,  according to the ezgulik human rights group . 
more than <num>400</num>  members of unregistered religious groups have been prosecuted in kashkadarya and andijan oblasts in the past six months ,  the human rights in central asia association said . 
in all those cases ,  prosecutors say the defendants were involved in the july <num>2009</num>  attempted assassination of anvar-kori tursunov ,  the chief imam of tashkent ;  and the august <num>2009</num>  slayings of abror abrorov ,  deputy director of the kukeldash madrassa ,  and khassan asadov ,  chief of the interior ministrys counterterrorism department . 
the accused also face charges of anti-constitutional activity and high treason . 
the action group said that since <num>1991</num>  , more than <num>10,000</num>  muslim activists in uzbekistan have received lengthy prison terms . 
aidyn gudarzi ,  an uzbek scholar of islam ,  estimates the number of religious prisoners in uzbekistan at <num>7,000</num>  .
exiled uzbek political scientist tashbulat yuldashev said ,  uzbek authorities have been seeking to persuade their own nation and the international community that repression in this situation is unavoidable . 
the majority of such cases are simply trumped up ,  agreed an anonymous uzbek political scientist . 
the intensity of police surveillance makes it hard for any uzbek to be a sympathiser of an extremist organisation ,  he said . 
some groups may be interested in presenting those trials as repressions against muslims ,  an anonymous source in the prosecutor-generals office told central asia online . 
but we have a commission of experts who determine whether a suspect or a defendant is a member of an extremist organisation . 
but the families of many past defendants disagree . 
the authorities exploit the absence of good lawyers ,  said rukhiddin kamilov ,  a tashkent-based attorney who defended numerous religious ,  human rights and media clients before the government took away his law licence . 
a government culling of the profession has left almost no defence lawyers who are willing to stand up to police and judges ,  he said . 
only an integrated system of good lawyers ,  human rights defenders and journalists will break the pattern of flagrantly illegal trials ,  he said . 
for persecution of muslims to cease ,  the countrys entire political system needs to change ,  he said . 
a time will come when people rise up to demand respect for their rights ,  said surat ikramov ,  chief of the action group . 
an anonymous human rights expert from tashkent warned that even if extremists did not gain power in uzbekistan ,  they may be able to strengthen their position . 
there are enough members of hizb ut-tahrir ,  the islamic jihad union and other  ( radical )  organisations in uzbekistan ,  the observer said . 
many were jailed unfairly ,  to be sure . 
but they were caught with arms in hand ,  and armed clashes did take place . 
there are extremists and there are sympathisers who number in the thousands and even tens of thousands . 
the action groups ikramov suggests that the government should release all convicted muslims and pay large sums to them and their families - the way they did in the soviet union after stalins repressions . 
such a policy would be a way to stabilise the situation ,  he said . 
fergana valley peaceful no more
ngo representatives from the fergana valley discuss border and customs issues during a seminar in batken ,  osh oblast . 
ngos say they can influence the governments of the region to make the right decisions . 
 [ bakyt ibraimov ] 
osh - unfixed borders ,  poverty ,  corruption and competition for land are fuelling ethnic clashes along the frontiers of kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan in the fergana valley ,  activists and residents say . 
bad blood is evident when villagers talk about the other countries . 
the culprit crossed the river and hid in the village of sultanabad in uzbekistan ,  said marapat . 
her neighbours have since been afraid to let their children play along that river ,  she said . 
kyrgyz taxi driver joomart said young men from uzbek villages often cross the border :  they graze their cattle  ( here )  . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  because of this ,  we often have ethnic conflicts . 
uzbeks have complaints about alleged abuses by kyrgyz ,  too . 
citizens of uzbekistan have difficulty visiting their relatives in the sokh and shakhimardan enclaves . 
kyrgyz soldiers unceremoniously demand money ,  and when someone complains ,   ( the officials )  confiscate their papers ,  he said . 
ngos are frustrated by the three governments failure to remedy the international friction . 
leaders of <num>30</num>  public organisations in bordering regions of the kyrgyz republic ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan have united into the dolina mira  ( valley of peace )  network to <abbr>…</abbr>  reduce ethnic tensions in the fergana valley ,  said dolina mira president and founder raya kadyrova . 
the network dates back to april <num>2006</num>  .
the dolina mira tries to mitigate conflicts over border issues ,  ethnic differences ,  migration ,  <abbr>etc.</abbr> 
it consults with border communities and local governments ,  holds information campaigns at schools and helps regulate trans-border commerce . 
the status quo of border violations and abuse by officials is fraying interethnic relations ,  ngo members said . 
frontier residents dissatisfaction with corruption in law enforcement is leading to destabilisation ,  said fergana valley lawyers without borders director azizbek ashurov . 
in order to avoid such cases ,  we aid the victims . 
his organisation helped two uzbeks regain their documents from kyrgyz border guards in kyzyl-kyya who demanded us <num>100</num>  $  , he said . 
poverty ,  unemployment ,  religious extremism and the militarisation of the region have led to interstate ,  interethnic conflicts and an increase in tensions between the states ,  said zhenishbek mamatov ,  an analyst at the southern vector foundation . 
tajik citizens have illegally developed land in kyrgyzstans leilek district ,  he said ,  citing maksat as one kyrgyz village dealing with unwanted tajik migrants . 
the authorities deny the existence of any problem . 
i cannot give you a precise number of tajik citizens living there <abbr>…</abbr>  - so as not to cause a public reaction . 
the foundation for tolerance international ,  a kyrgyz research organisation ,  said that in <num>2008</num>  , <num>116</num>  tajik illegal migrant families were living in maksat and farming 36h of land . 
tajik authorities consider part of the village disputed territory ,  said kyrgyz researcher zeinura isabekova . 
tajiks even threatened physical harm to her and her colleagues when they protested unauthorised use of kyrgyz pastureland ,  she said . 
tajiks involved in the dispute were not available to comment . 
border squabbling can lead to international conflict ,  she warned ,  recalling how some years ago the kyrgyz and tajik presidents gave incendiary speeches about a territorial dispute concerning batken oblast . 
one tajik man reportedly drew his dagger and ordered the kyrgyz to leave . 
police from both countries had to disperse the crowd . 
meanwhile ,  the population of the fergana valley continues to grow ,  forcing tajiks to leave the valley or to move to areas that have no formally accepted border -- a dangerous combination . 
the fergana valley's problems won't go away unless outside help occurs ,  predicted mamatov . 
without such intervention ,  he warned ,   " opposition at the state-to-state level will grow stronger - something that will have negative consequences for the entire population "  . 
afghan analysts call for loya jirga to negotiate peace with taliban
afghan delegates vote during the loya jirga assembly in kabul ,  december <num>15</num>  , <num>2003</num>  .
a consultative jirga is scheduled for april <num>28</num>  to begin laying the groundwork for peace in the country . 
 [ shah marai / afp / getty images ] 
kabul - in a country built on tribal affiliations and governance ,  some afghan political leaders and intellectuals say only a jirga - truly representing the countrys influential tribes - can convince the taliban to end their insurgency . 
all such efforts failed in the past because none of the process was transparent or had true representation of the afghan people ,  said wadir safi ,  a senior analyst and chairman of the faculty of international law and political sciences at the university of kabul . 
if the afghan government and world are serious about resolving the decades-old conflict ,  they must involve the traditional leadership of the afghan tribes ,  safi told central asia online . 
the april <num>28</num>  consultative jirga is expected to include tribal elders ,  the kabul government ,  and some less-extreme taliban leaders . 
the upcoming jirga is to prepare for a loya jirga ,  and to decide how to reach out to taliban members and get them to participate in process . 
haji din muhammad ,  former governor of kabul and member of an influential family from nangarhar ,  said the atmosphere is very congenial for reconciliation among the warring sides in afghanistan . 
personally ,  i feel some attraction from all sides to peace and reconciliation ,  and we need to exploit it sincerely ,  din muhammad told central asia online . 
he said ,  however ,  the process must be afghan-driven . 
the international community should provide logistics and stay away and let the afghans decide peace ,  said din muhammad . 
din muhammad said that while the upcoming jirga is a consultative jirga ,  it needs to be taken as a serious business instead of a formality . 
this jirga will determine how to talk to and reconcile with the opponents ,  he said . 
he called upon influential individuals to back the process . 
safi agrees . 
he asked the government and world not to repeat what he called past mistakes committed at the bonn conference and subsequent loya jirgas . 
those  ( who )  went to bonn and participated in loya jirgas were not leaders of afghan tribes . 
… the majority were warlords or expatriates from western countries ,  safi said . 
hameedullah amin ,  chancellor of kabul university ,  also criticized the structure of the <num>2001</num>  bonn conference and subsequent loya jirga . 
haji din muhammad ,  former governor of kabul ,  said he believes all sides are attracted to the prospect of peace and reconciliation . 
 [ hasan khan ] 
din muhammad ,  amin and safi unanimously urged the government to convene the autonomous traditional loya jirga for resolution of the problems . 
warning the administration of president hamid karzai of black sheep in its fold ,  safi said there are people in the government who are not really interested in peace . 
they  ( the opponents of peace )  flourish on the war economy … and have constructed multi-storey plazas with ill-gotten money ,  including from drugs ,  he said . 
din muhammad said those who just say yes ,  sir should not be invited to jirgas . 
he has also offered to help the government contact the taliban . 
amin also feared the failure of the peace process if true representatives ,  in his view ,  of afghan tribes do not have their say . 
a chance must be given to tribal elders to find a solution for the conflict ,  amin said . 
as we failed to solve it by force - so a solution must be found through dialogue . 
peace is in the interest of the afghan and international community . 
muhammad ismail yun ,  advisor to karzai on culture and a member of the national security council ,  expressed optimism regarding the outcome of the current dialogue process . 
there is no option except peace now ,  yun told central asia online . 
the government has already initiated dialogue with one of the factions . 
unlike the hizb-e-islami led by gulbuddin hikmatyar ,  the taliban are politically weak ,  having no experience of dialogue . 
they cant take political advantage of military gains ,  said yun . 
like safi ,  yun expressed apprehension about a strong lobby in the government that does not want peace . 
kyrgyz opposition demonstrators tangle with security forces outside the talas regional government centre april <num>6</num>  .
demonstrators ,  protesting the arrest of opposition leaders ,  seized the building and held the regional governor until they were dispersed later that evening by special forces troops . 
talas ,  kyrgyzstan -- special forces troops reportedly retook the talas regional government centre tuesday night ,  ending a nearly day-long occupation of the building by opposition demonstrators who took the governor hostage april <num>6</num>  and named an alternative governor . 
witnesses said military aircraft flew in troops who retook the square and building in mere minutes ,  before demonstrators could even respond with the stones and molotov cocktails they had prepared . 
a military helicopter is flying back and forth low over the city and you can hear gunshots in the city ,  one local resident told central asia online by telephone around 10p bishkek time tuesday . 
everyone is sitting at home and not going out . 
gulbara imankulova ,  director of the talas media centre ,  told central asia online the demonstration began in the morning in front of the government building in talas . 
in an evening tv broadcast ,  minister of interior moldomus kongantiyev said the central square of talas had been cleared of demonstrators and the governor had been freed . 
kongantiyev said opposition leader bolot sherniyazov gave vodka to the demonstrators so they could prepare molotov cocktails . 
they … took hostage the governors building and the governor himself . 
shamil murat ,  of the for democracy and civil society organisation ,  said before the troops arrival that more than <num>2,000</num>  demonstrators had massed around the government building . 
he said the molotov cocktails were to be used in case special forces commandoes try to disperse them . 
unrest reportedly erupted after police detained opposition members who were planning to lead an april <num>7</num>  opposition kurultai ,  or town meeting ,  including sherniyazov ,  a former parliamentary deputy and opposition member . 
police eventually released him ,  but by then discontent had boiled over ,  according to ata-meken party chief omurbek tekebayev ,  who also called the action an effort by the masses to approach the oblast governor rather than a seizure of power . 
citizens of talas have been demanding basic freedoms they say they have lost ,  according to central asia onlines correspondent in bishkek . 
agriculture minister iskander aidaraliyev ,  a former governor of the oblast ,  was reportedly already in talas to try to defuse the situation before the demonstration . 
the demonstrators were gathering to express dissatisfaction with president kurmanbek bakiyevs rule ,  a january <num>1</num>  increase in utility rates and alleged violations of civil liberties . 
retirees have complained that they had not received a promised monthly pension increase of <num>200</num>  kgs  ( us <num>4.42</num>  $  )  . 
at the planned april <num>7</num>  kurultai ,  the opposition intended to demand a reduction in utility rates and more respect for civil liberties . 
according to imankulova ,  all schools ,  government offices and organisations had warned their employees that they would be closed that day . 
prosecutors reportedly plan to charge protest organisers and participants under article <num>297</num>  of the criminal code ,  which prohibits violent efforts to overthrow the government . 
the interior ministry gave its own timetable and account of the talas events ,  which put the start of the protest at 1 . 20p and its end at 4 . 25pm . 
about <num>500</num>  demonstrators surrounded the oblast government building and demanded that the leaders come out ,  the ministry said . 
bolotbekov tried to calm them ,  but they reportedly threw rocks at the building and stormed it . 
the demonstrators ,  in that account ,  also tried twice to take over the police station . 
sources throughout the day put the number of protesters anywhere from <num>700</num>  to <num>3,000</num>  .
photographs showed a relatively small crowd during the day ,  but it apparently grew in the evening . 
demonstrators plan to continue their protest wednesday . 
a repetition of this situation is possible in naryn where leading citizens are negotiating for change ,  said activist azimbek beknazarov ,  who is in naryn . 
he said they want government officials to peacefully hand over power . 
the citizens of naryn are negotiating to have the police come over to their side <abbr>…</abbr>  but there has been no reply yet from the authorities ,  he said . 
an unverified report of further unrest ,  posted on the ata-meken partys website ,  said unknown individuals sprayed graffiti on one of bakiyevs residences outside bishkek :  bakiyev is a thief !

druzhinniki plan to provide security in town . 
they are organising both spontaneously and in orderly fashion . 
nazarov said he has tried to contact isakov in an effort to coordinate efforts between his groups ,  the youth initiative group and another group that has taken up patrols near the white house . 
he added that phone service in bishkek has been inconsistent ,  further hindering coordination . 
isakov promised that by night military patrols would be on duty in town ,  but its evening already and that hasnt happened ,  nazarov said late thursday .

a doctor examines a patient for breast cancer at the pectoral surgery institution in tashkent . 
cancer is on the rise in uzbekistan and care for the disease is too expensive for many uzbeks . 
 [ shakar saadi ] 
tashkent - in uzbekistan ,  having cancer can mean more than just a struggle with the disease ;  it can also mean a struggle to obtain treatment . 
aziz alimov ,  <num>35</num>  , has stage iii testicular cancer . 
doctors diagnosed him three years ago and immediately recommended surgery but were unable to cure him . 
the surgeon wanted us <num>400</num>  $  for the operation ,  he said . 
the average monthly wage in the country is us <num>200</num>  $  .
we bought the dressings ,  gloves ,  syringes and intravenous systems ourselves . 
the clinic had none of the medications needed for chemotherapy ,  he complained . 
he said he had to resort to using personal connections at the health ministry to obtain the medicine . 
shortages or the outright absence of medicine is a common problem ,  said patients and relatives . 
at the republican oncology research centre  ( rorc )  where i was treated ,  only the bed and painkillers were free . 
we had to pay for everything else ,  said alimov . 
every year ,  the government allocates more than us <num>200</num>  $  . to purchase cancer medicines ,  said deputy minister of health bakhtiyor niyazmatov . 
niyazmatov said the amount budgeted for cancer medication would grow ,  but he didnt specify when or by how much . 
from the state ,  we received only painkillers to palliate  ( my sick son ) … ,  said mukhaiyo aliyeva ,  whose son doniyor died at the age of <num>41</num>  in january from stomach cancer . 
doctors agree that poor public awareness of cancer ,  lack of preventive measures aimed at early diagnosis ,  and lack of funding help worsen cancer mortality in uzbekistan . 
president islam karimovs daughters ,  gulnara karimova and lola karimova-tillyayeva ,  have joined the fight against cancer . 
in february ,  uzbekistan signed the charter of paris against cancer . 
signing for uzbekistan at the ceremony in france was karimova-tillyayeva ,  the countrys permanent representative to unesco . 
as a signatory ,  uzbekistan will seek to raise public awareness about the disease ,  improve cancer patients access to quality healthcare and the best methods of screening ,  and learn from the international experience in fighting cancer ,  said karimova-tillyayeva . 
the number of cancer patients nationwide reached <num>90,000</num>   ( <num>4,000</num>  are children )  in <num>2009</num>  , according to the health ministry . 
the figure represents approximately <num>0.4</num>  %  of the countrys population . 
in <num>2009</num>  , <num>17,149</num>  uzbeks were diagnosed with cancer . 
the most common cancers in the country are of the breast ,  stomach ,  lung and cervix ,  in that order ,  said rorc director sarimbek navruzov . 
sixty percent of the patients are rural residents ;  more than half are women . 
in february ,  zhenskoe sobraniye adopted the programme for the prevention ,  early detection and treatment of breast cancer and the rehabilitation of women diagnosed with breast cancer . 
it has funding from multiple sources . 
the programme assists in diagnosis ,  treatment ,  prosthetics ,  psychological support and rehabilitation . 
in addition ,  the programme organises educational outreach projects ,  trains medical personnel ,  runs a database ,  provides legal assistance and conducts other various activities . 
the number of early diagnoses of breast cancer has increased <num>7</num> -<num>9</num>  %  over the past three years thanks to zhenskoe sobraniye ,  navruzov said . 
the organisation saved her from having to sell her apartment to buy medication ,  she said . 
most patients arrive at specialised oncological centres with advanced-stage cancer ,  navruzov said . 
lack of personnel hinders early diagnosis of cancer in the regions ,  he conceded . 
meanwhile ,  in <num>2009</num>  , scientists at the republican centre for pathological anatomy  ( rcpa )  discovered a method of diagnosing cancer at stage <num>0</num>  .
viktor krakhmalev and adkham paiziyev have patented a substance that marks cancer cells on microscope slides . 
cancer can be diagnosed at stage <num>0</num>  , when there is no tumour . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  this test takes only a few minutes . 
our work of skilfully realising its potential still remains ,  rcpa director malika abdullakhojayeva said . 
at this point ,  scientists have confirmed the effectiveness of this test only for diagnosing cervical cancer . 
the research is ongoing ,  abdullakhojayeva said . 
imu schism breaks organisation into units with different objectives
uzbek and afghan militants sit in the custody of security forces in pakistan in <num>2008</num>  .
the islamic movement of uzbekistan is believed to have split into two groups and seems to be having trouble recruiting because of the imus reputation for savagery . 
 [ tariq mahmood / afp / getty images ] 
the views expressed do not necessarily represent those of central asia online . 
bishkek -- since late <num>2009</num>  , a split within the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  has been taking shape ,  with ideology and differences in tactics driving the wedge . 
such situations have arisen before within the imu ,  but this time the matter is more serious for several reasons . 
first ,  the imu has lost personnel in fighting in pakistan ;  second ,  the imus reputation for savagery is turning away some prospects . 
imu militants belonging to the organisations reputedly most brutal division have been fighting in south waziristan ,  pakistan . 
like the taliban ,  the imu has suffered great losses . 
according to unconfirmed information ,  the number of killed ,  wounded and captured surpasses <num>1,000</num>  .
with the core members campaign in waziristan proving unsuccessful ,  the imu is experiencing gridlock in an internal debate on strategy . 
militants have openly complained that supporting the taliban and fighting the pakistani government have nothing to do with the imus original objective of holy war in central asia . 
consequently ,  many imu members say that the organisation should refrain from interfering in afghanistan and pakistan and focus on the groups objective . 
this call includes the urgent relocation of all combat-ready forces to the fergana valley and the creation of many small bases in southern kyrgyzstan and badakhshan ,  tajikistan . 
within the organisation there are two opposing divisions . 
a man with the alias yahya heads one closely linked to al-qaeda in general and to osama bin laden in particular . 
yahyas division promotes the objective of global jihad . 
to achieve this end ,  all methods are permissible ,  even the cruelest . 
yahyas group has little interest in ousting the secular uzbek ,  kyrgyz and tajik governments in order to form a single caliphate someday . 
recent data show yahyas supporters make up one-third of the imus membership . 
the reason militants support yahya is quite cliched :  many have married and started families in waziristan ,  pakistan . 
these militants have already tasted global battle and do not want to return to their homelands in central asia anytime soon . 
the imu has created countless enemies in waziristan through its behaviour . 
residents of pakistans tribal areas who say they repeatedly witnessed massacres by the imu drove the organisations members from their villages . 
many of these residents say that the imus members are ruthless and act like machines when it comes to murder . 
so they rallied against their unwanted guests . 
the second imu division comprises the majority of the organisations membership . 
its leader is abdurahman ,  the right-hand man of tahir yuldashev ,  one of the founders of central asias islamic movements . 
in khanabad ,  which borders kyrgyzstan ,  a group of imu extremists attacked the regional department of internal affairs and the national security services buildings early on may <num>26</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
the bombings and shootings killed <num>20</num>  innocent people . 
clashes in isfara and tavildara affected many more . 
such incidents confirm the imus return to the fergana valley . 
the members there have a single objective :  overthrow islam karimovs regime in uzbekistan and begin building a caliphate from that country . 
uzbekistan has the largest population in the region and has considerable potential in terms of weaponry and of its occupation of nearly all of the fergana valley . 
however ,  some predict that many of yahyas supporters will switch to abdurahmans side if there is confirmation that yuldashev ,  the imus founder ,  is alive and competent . 
pakistani officials have said that an aerial strike killed him last august . 
in any case ,  the imu now is faced with licking its wounds ;  recruiting new fighters ;  training them in camps near war zones like afghanistan ,  pakistan and possibly chechnya ;  and breaking them in in battle . 
most likely ,  the organisation will find its replenishment among the socially disadvantaged segments of the fergana valleys population foremost and then in other parts of uzbekistan and southern kyrgyzstan . 
kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan are historically not militant states . 
for this reason ,  few accept the organisations violent internal regulations ,  which even include sadistic games . 
few prospects are prepared for the fate of becoming a shahid :  that is ,  to give their lives for  " faith "  and the imu by taking part in the planning and execution of terrorist acts . 
the imu is trying a new approach ,  though ,  to attract recruits .

tajikistan hosts rubezh-2010 counter-terrorism exercises
tajik border guards take part in the rubezh-2010 exercise ,  which participants described as crucial to regional security . 
 [ maks maksudov ] 
khujand ,  tajikistan -- regional security was on the minds of military commanders recently as tajikistan hosted the rubezh-2010 counter-terrorism exercises april <num>22</num> -<num>26</num>  .
troops from kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  russia and tajikistan participated . 
uzbekistan sent observers ,  but no troops ,  because it objects to some russian policies in central asia ,  such as basing russian forces in kyrgyzstan . 
the troops had support from mi-8 helicopter gunships ,  an-2 transport planes and l-39 training jets ,  ria novosti reported . 
the exercises were important to national and regional security ,  said tajik minister of defence sherali khairullayev . 
emerging trends suggest that in the 21st century ,  central asia is gradually turning into the centre of shifting global processes ,  he said . 
our aim is to not allow the region to turn into a place of conflict . 
the troops simulated a mock invasion of northern tajikistan by a <num>120</num> -member band of terrorists . 
the participants covered the national border ,  evacuated villagers and searched for illegal armed groups . 
once they identified their enemies ,  the troops pursued and destroyed them with artillery ,  mortars ,  rocket launchers and tanks . 
drill organisers set up a camp ,  complete with a field hospital and sports fields . 
the exercise refined counter-terrorism measures in border areas and tactical collaboration between csto rapid reaction force units and tajik forces in destroying simulated extremist groups from afghanistan ,  said faridun makhmadaliyev ,  the tajik defence ministrys chief spokesman . 
we want this exercise to be done so professionally that there is no loss of life in the event of a real threat . 
conducting such exercises is a necessity . 
the will to hold such exercises was always there ,  but the money wasnt ,  nagovitsyn said . 
but now ,  everything is there and everything will increase because favourable conditions exist "  . 
bin laden's former bodyguard calls on youth to reject violence
a frame grab from an afp video shows nasser al-bahri ,  a former bodyguard of osama bin laden ,  during an interview in sanaa on april <num>22</num>  .
bahri wants to dissuade youth from joining al-qaeda or becoming violent jihadists and ,  with the help of a french journalist ,  has written a book titled in the shadow of bin laden . 
 [ afp / getty images ] 
a former osama bin laden bodyguard is calling on youth to follow a peaceful path . 
nasser al-bahri ,  formerly known as abu jandal ,  spent several years as osama bin laden's bodyguard ,  fighting alongside the al-qaeda leader in afghanistan and helping him indoctrinate youth from saudi arabia and yemen . 
after a disagreement with bin laden ,  al-bahri left al-qaeda and returned to yemen in <num>2000</num>  , where he was imprisoned for <num>18</num>  months . 
yemeni authorities released him as a reformed jihadist . 
al-bahri today is still reaching out to youth ,  albeit for a different reason :  to dissuade them from choosing the path of violence . 
in interviews with media outlets ,  al-bahri acknowledges  " ideological differences with the west "  ,  and speaks of  " injustice "  committed against muslims . 
however ,  the man who started his jihadist career in bosnia ,  and spent time in somalia and tajikistan before joining bin laden in afghanistan ,  now says dialogue - not violence - is the answer . 
central asia online's correspondent in sanaa ,  faisal darem ,  interviewed al-bahri about this transformation and about a book al-bahri co-authored about bin laden . 
cao :  nasser al-bahri - what kind of person is he today ,  and what differentiates him from the young man who joined bin laden in 1996 ? 
al-bahri :  there is a huge difference between the nasser al-bahri of today and the jihadist abu jandal . 
back then i was an immature youth who was ill-informed about events taking place around me . 
i was looking for a means to fulfil an ambition ,  which materialised by joining sheikh osama bin laden . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  now ,  i live my life and enjoy it much more than when i fought and took up position in some hideout . 
i think jihad takes many different forms ,  and calling people to islam ,  reforming society and helping youth develop their capabilities are what i consider to be the most important forms of jihad . 
al-bahri :  a french journalist who is an experienced biographer made the proposal . 
al-bahri :  al-qaeda is one of the manifestations of violence ,  and i am against the use of violence in certain situations and for the use of violence in others . 
every time has its own circumstances and particularities surrounding it . 
… i believe that dialogue is the most important means for intellectual persuasion ,  in addition to providing the right conditions for muslim youth . 
through my experience of living with them in afghanistan ,  i noticed that the harsh conditions of life had driven them to that situation ,  especially when they were deprived of the ability to earn a livelihood . 
they would resort to jihad in order to restore some of their rights . 
al-bahri :  i would say that the bombings taking place today in yemen ,  which are meant to disrupt public peace as part of a certain agenda of killing innocent people ,  are unacceptable . 
the problem of al-qaeda outside afghanistan is that it does not have a clear strategy ,  and it is not part of an overall hierarchical structure ,  and it does not have legitimacy as a religious and legal entity ,  such as working under the leadership of scholars . 
the fact is that these organisations have two or three students who issue fatwas ,  and this is wrong . 
that is why i urge young people not to hasten to take up arms and engage in fighting in order to preserve lives . 
allah has forbidden the taking of life except with proper justification . 
i would mend differences and rally the forces ,  in addition to acting as the personal bodyguard of bin laden . 
i was also involved in fighting and skirmishes in afghanistan and sustained injuries . 
cao :  from your experience ,  what is the nature of the relationship between the leadership cadres of al-qaeda and the subsidiary organisations such as al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula ,  or iraq ,  or the maghreb ,  and what are the differences between them ? 
al-bahri :  we have never heard or received a statement from osama bin laden confirming the existence of a link between the organisation of al-qaeda in afghanistan and al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula . 
however ,  these organisations attach themselves to the parent al-qaeda organisation ,  because one of the means of survival is to be affiliated to another group ,  and al-qaeda is one of the most famous organisations in the islamic world . 
this is why everyone wants to be affiliated with that organisation ,  even thought there are other organisations such as the egyptian islamic jihad .  …
al-bahri :  i have been accused of spying on them many times ,  and i have received death threats ,  and i have received threats on my phone . 
some of them even declared me an apostate . 
but my response to them is that if i were really a spy ,  i would want to mix with them and not leave them . 
al-bahri :  actually ,  if i had the chance to meet sheikh osama ,  i would kiss him on his head ,  his forehead and cheeks . 
i would ask him to pray for me ,  because i am engaged in another form of jihad . 
i am in a battle where i use my own methods to raise awareness among youth and build their capacity so that they can lead a normal life . 
from my experience living with the mujahedeen youths ,  i became convinced that they resorted to jihad to escape harsh conditions . 
they were unable to make a normal living because of poor education and lack of employment . 
for this reason ,  i have dedicated my time to address youth problems through human development programmes and enhancement of their abilities and skills ,  so that this might help them in their lives . 
new taliban commander dangerous but articulate
five south koreans kidnapped by the taliban are released in ghazni ,  about <num>140</num>  kilometer  south of kabul ,  august <num>29</num>  , <num>2007</num>  .
the five were among <num>21</num>  south koreans whom the taliban held hostage for six weeks that year . 
abdul qayum zakir ,  mullah mohammad omars new deputy ,  was released from a kabul prison as part of the deal that freed the koreans . 
 [ shah marai / afp / getty images ] 
kabul -  " he is dangerous and cruel . 
he forced people in his home district ,  kajaki ,  in southern helmand province ,  to join the taliban when the extremist group was not yet driven out of power "  . 
this was the first comment of a kajaki resident who is familiar with the new taliban commander ,  mullah abdul qayyum zakir ,  also known as abdullah ghulam rasoul . 
zakir ,  a deputy to mullah omar ,  replaces mullah abdul ghani baradar ,  whom pakistani authorities arrested in karachi in february . 
mullah dadullah also was from helmand . 
the population came to know him for his army of suicide bombers and reputation for killing anyone who opposed his ideas . 
a coalition operation in helmand in <num>2007</num>  killed him . 
some taliban commanders wrote to mullah omar requesting that he appoint zakir as his deputy ,  according to international media that quoted those commanders . 
field commanders preferred zakir over many senior commanders because he  " often visits them in the field ,   <abbr>…</abbr>  is quick in decision ,  is as dangerous as dadullah but as articulate as baradar "  ,  a former taliban official told central asia online . 
zakir helped baradar write the  " taliban code of conduct "  and formed a commission to police violations of it ,  sources close to the taliban said . 
by enforcing the code ,  he is trying to recruit the support of the afghan public ,  they said . 
zakir joined the taliban after its founding in <num>1995</num>  , fought against the northern alliance ,  and was arrested in kunduz province in <num>2001</num>  .
the afghan government transferred him to guantanamo bay in or around <num>2006</num>  .
zakir was back in afghan hands ,  in pul-e-charkhi prison in <num>2007</num>  , when kabul released him as part of a deal to obtain the freedom of <num>21</num>  south korean hostages . 
he then began commanding insurgents in the southern provinces ,  particularly helmand . 
british forces fought his subordinates many times . 
tashkent and dushanbe unable to agree in rogun dispute
a train of tanker cars steams down a tajik railway . 
uzbekistan recently delayed more than <num>1,000</num>  rail cars headed for tajikistan . 
 [ nozim kalandarov ] 
dushanbe - uzbekistan is starting its third month of delaying the transit of tajik-bound railway freight cars . 
but while uzbekistan attributes the stoppage to technical problems ,  tajikistan says it is extortion . 
the dispute is an extension of the spat between the two countries over construction of the rogun dam . 
uzbekistan opposes roguns construction ,  saying the project threatens its water supply and the regions environment . 
on april <num>27</num>  , a delegation from tajikistan left for tashkent hoping to free more than <num>1,100</num>  cars ,  including <num>660</num>  with fuel ,  <num>230</num>  with grain and others carrying concrete and machinery . 
much of that is slated for roguns construction . 
the main task is to  ( guarantee )  the future rail transit of freight destined for tajikistan through uzbekistan ,  said tajik railways director amonullo hukumatullo . 
but the negotiations ultimately turned into a discussion of rogun . 
we did not come to an agreement ,  said an anonymous representative of the tajik government . 
uzbek authorities have set an ultimatum :  the freight will go if we suspend all work on the construction of the rogun  ( hydropower project )  until the final results of the feasibility study and environmental assessment . 
the dispute goes back to late february ,  when freight shipments to tajikistan via uzbek railways virtually halted . 
since then ,  tajik officials have rejected uzbek explanations ,  including an uzbek claim that mudslides destroyed part of the railway . 
but the uzbek foreign ministry said its not motivated just by opposition to rogun . 
the manyfold increase in freight traffic and the overload of uzbekistans rail infrastructure in connection with the countrys obligation  ( to deliver )  humanitarian cargo to afghanistan are causing the problem ,  said an anonymous uzbek diplomat . 
uzbek railway representatives also said <num>340</num>  rail cars with bauxite are presently moving through their country without difficulty . 
uzbekistan delivered <num>1,720</num>  bauxite-filled cars to regar ,  tajikistan ,  between march <num>23</num>  and april <num>15</num>  , they added . 
the dispute has had a disastrous impact on tajik businesses . 
and vendors say they arent receiving new merchandise . 
economists find it difficult to estimate the losses . 
farmers and agricultural companies working with petroleum products ,  seeds and fertilisers were the biggest losers ,  mullojanov said . 
but ,  the real damage to the tajik economy will come if uzbekistan withholds deliveries of bauxite ,  the ore needed for the talco aluminium smelter . 
tajikistan depends on the smelter for much of its gdp . 
though the freight issue is another example of the increasing severity of the spat between the two countries ,  political analyst rustam samiyev said that negotiations in themselves are a good sign . 
this means the governments are <abbr>…</abbr>  ready to continue dialogue . 
an anonymous uzbek analyst said the delay of tajik-bound freight cars has demonstrated uzbekistans leverage . 
tajik political analyst parviz mullojanov said the dispute requires a mediator . 
but others say the issue is far from being resolved . 
it is unlikely that tajikistan will suspend roguns construction ,  mullojanov said . 
even if such a desire emerged ,  it would be difficult not to lose face domestically and abroad . 
… perhaps ,  some private compromise will be made ,  but for the time being they are not ready . 
haidarov also said nothing will change in the coming decade . 
concessions to uzbekistan will be judged by  ( uzbek authorities )  as a sign of weakness ,  he said . 
this is a small victory for tashkent ,  samiyev said . 
but  ( tajik president emomali rakhmon )  is not yielding on the key issue of whether to build rogun . 
central asia celebrates 65t anniversary of victory day
wwii veterans attend an event marking the 65t anniversary of victory day in bishkek may <num>6</num>  .
 [ aynur asanova ] 
bishkek -- abram galitsinsky still remembers going to war in <num>1941</num>  in his early <num>20</num>  second  . 
i was wounded six times ,  the <num>88</num>  year-old bishkek resident said . 
in the beginning it was very difficult . 
at night ,  we had to walk <num>60</num>  kilometer  ,  and during the day fight . 
… we ran ,  shouting forward ! 
not even the hail of enemy bullets could stop us . 
the veterans enjoy congratulations ,  share their memories ,  and try to pass along some of the wisdom theyve gathered over the years . 
galitsinsky asks younger generations to appreciate peace and avoid events such as those of april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  in kyrgyzstan . 
our generation does not know what war is ,  said arzygul muradova ,  <num>20</num>  , a student in ashgabat . 
we live in peace thanks to our forefathers heroism . 
… i want to be like them and to eternally thank them . 
while some fought ,  others toiled . 
they said it was difficult ,  but they managed . 
on may <num>9</num>  , cis veterans of wwii will receive the cis jubilee medal ,  which was established in honour of the 65t anniversary of victory day . 
central asia began celebrating may <num>1</num>  with concerts ,  competitions ,  meetings with veterans ,  war films ,  performances and parades . 
central asias presidents have ordered that veterans receive cash prizes and gifts . 
from turkmenistan <num>300,000</num>  volunteers left for the front ,  <num>80,000</num>  of whom didnt return . 
therefore ,  the victory is dear to us ,  marking the strength of my generations spirit ,  said turkmen veteran sapar begliyev . 
turkmenistan was one of the soviet armys rear bases ,  and soviet authorities evacuated many nazi-endangered factories to the hinterlands . 
turkmen citizens contributed <num>280</num>  meter  rubles and <num>7,392</num>  kilogram  of silver and gold to the soviet defence fund for the construction of tanks and air squadrons . 
about <num>3,000</num>  turkmen veterans will celebrate the victory . 
they will go to the eternal flame with flowers in memory of the nations heroes ,  and the central state archives will release a catalogue of pertinent documents and books . 
uzbekistan will be holding charity events and dinners among other activities . 
a number of tajik veterans will take part in events in moscow ,  saint petersburg and france ,  according to mamo akramova of the council of veterans of tajikistan . 
in dushanbe , there will be lavish open-air festivities ,  parades ,  concerts and competitions . 
labourers are completing construction of a walkway in park pobedy that will display the names and photographs of <num>63</num>  heroes of the ussr . 
veterans also received an increase in their pensions . 
i would like our generation not to forget the veterans and to be grateful to them ,  dushanbe student sukhailo niyozova said . 
kyrgyzstan will celebrate on staraya ploshchad in front of the parliament ,  where the interim government is based . 
authorities decided not to have a military parade with the bloody april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  popular uprising still so recent . 
kazakhstan has budgeted <num>10</num>  billion kzt  ( us <num>10</num>  )  for the celebration ,  kazakh defence ministry spokesman kaisar mugalov said . 
the main events in that country are taking place in astana . 
participating veterans are receiving free travel ,  meals and accommodations . 
kazakhstan has <num>14,400</num>  surviving wwii veterans . 
on may <num>9</num>  , kazakhstan will inaugurate memorials in each of the oblast capitals . 
the national bank will issue a commemorative coin . 
but some veterans ,  who endured rounds of social turmoil ,  impoverishment and the encroachments of old age ,  feel neglected . 
they remember us once a year ,  sergei listopadov ,  a veteran from almaty ,  agreed . 
no one has cared about us for a long time . 
we lost so much in this war ,  and now we live in destitution ,  forgotten by everyone . 
bishkek veteran galitsinsky has buried his entire family and has no one to rely on for help . 
a neighbour now looks after him . 
tajik veteran rafikov complained he doesnt have his own home ,  which ,  according to akramova ,  is a frequent problem for veterans . 
he was expelled from the dormitory where he lived and has moved in with his sister . 
my health is gone . 
i am almost blind and do not have enough money at all . 
it is hard ,  he said . 
kazakhstan to re-open border with kyrgyzstan may <num>11</num> 
cars line up at the kazakh-kyrgyz border crossing at the kazakhstani village of kordai before dawn early may <num>10</num>  - one day before the border was scheduled to reopen . 
kazakhstan closed the border april <num>7</num>  during the kyrgyz uprising ,  resulting in significant economic losses for both countries . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
bishkek - kazakhstan said it will reopen its border with kyrgyzstan may <num>11</num>  , possibly allowing kyrgyz-kazakh economic relations to return to their previous level quickly . 
kazakh officials sealed the border april <num>7</num>  , as the kyrgyz uprising began . 
at the time ,  the interim kyrgyz government expressed understanding . 
as soon as we had reached agreement on opening the border ,  the events  ( violent pogroms )  in mayeva took place ,  and  ( the kazakhs )  closed the border again . 
the biggest issue was not the ban on passage of individuals from kyrgyzstan to kazakhstan ,  but rather the ban on import of any goods ,  economist zhumakadyr akeneyev said . 
dordoi ,  the biggest wholesale market in central asia ,  was a true place of pilgrimage for shuttle traders from kazakhstan . 
dordoi was not only a source for goods that kazakhs sold in kazakhstan . 
some local shuttle traders carried the goods through kazakhstan all the way to russia . 
one such trader ,  mirakam osmonaliyeva ,  said the border closure hit her family hard . 
we were practically unemployed for a month ,  she said . 
our income comes from selling goods in russia ,  mostly in novosibirsk and yekaterinburg . 
our business is slow right now ,  but will pick up speed . 
sergei ponomarev ,  chairman of the kyrgyz association of markets ,  trading enterprises and services ,  said the border closure has had major economic consequences . 
kazakhstan is one of our main  ( trading )  partners . 
akeneyev and sariyev said both countries were hurt by the border closure . 
its a closed circle ,  akeneev said . 
our agriculture works on kazakhstani fuel . 
without fuel ,  theres no food . 
without food ,  theres no fuel . 
sariyev noted that the closure hurt kazakhstans markets . 
several major kyrgyz business associations appealed to their kazakh colleagues ,  including kazakhstani members of parliament and kazakhstani president nursultan nazarbayev ,  to open the border quickly . 
the kazakhstani decision to re-open the border came after a month of negotiations and mediation by a number of other countries . 
kyrgyz officials say the decision came at the right time . 
 " if the closure had gone on for one more week ,   ( the kyrgyz state )  faced the risk of defaulting "  ,  chyngyz makeshev ,  deputy chairman of the kyrgyz union of entrepreneurs ,  said . 
askarbek asanaliyev ,  director of the think tank centre for thought and economics ,  said he thinks economic relations with kazakhstan will return to their normal level soon . 
 " this week we'll see the revival of trade "  ,  he said . 
 "  it's possible that at the outset the volume of goods will be greater than usual ,  meaning that officials in may will collect more taxes than usual "  . 
tajikistan battles polio outbreak
dushanbe -- tajikistan is battling polio again ,  after going <num>13</num>  years without a single case . 
unicef confirmed <num>34</num>  cases this year as of may <num>4</num>  .
the world health organisation  ( who )  has reported <num>12</num>  deaths . 
they are the first cases of polio in tajikistan since <num>1997</num>  , causing a nationwide immunisation campaign . 
international donors are supplying the vaccine ,  while neighbouring countries hasten to keep the virus from infecting their citizens . 
our son was only <num>4</num>  years old ;  he passed away in just <num>24</num>  hours time ,  said rakhima ,  <num>28</num>  , of dushanbe ,  whose son navruz died of polio . 
at first ,  he complained of pain in his legs ,  and the doctors wrongfully diagnosed flu ,  rakhima said . 
even when his arms began to ache ,  no one suspected he was suffering from polio . 
the proper diagnosis came too late . 
i threatened them with all kinds of disastrous consequences ,  the doctor said . 
but many parents showed a shockingly indifferent attitude to their own kids health . 
tajik doctors and officials might have hidden the outbreak . 
it was not until russian medics started sounding the alarm in mid-april that our health ministry acknowledged more than <num>100</num>  , then more than <num>200</num>   ( suspected )  polio cases ,  a tajik health ministry official said on condition of anonymity . 
health minister nusratulloh salimov has acknowledged <num>206</num>  suspected polio cases ,  including <num>46</num>  in dushanbe . 
children received the first inoculations may <num>1</num> -<num>4</num>  , with doctors going from house to house explaining the importance of vaccination . 
about <num>4</num>  meter  doses of the oral polio vaccine procured by unicef were delivered to tajikistan april <num>27</num>  , said alexander sadykov ,  a unicef spokesman . 
doctors intend to vaccinate <num>1.1</num>  meter  children under age <num>6</num>  .
the doctor told us we had to bring the kids for inoculation ,  said maysara ,  a mother of four . 
the virus behind this outbreak originated in india ,  tajik chief sanitary physician azam mirzoyev said ,  and existing vaccines in tajikistan could not stop it . 
that is why prior inoculation failed to work ,  the anonymous health ministry official said . 
we were wrong in declining to accept vaccine delivery assistance from russian medics ,  who immediately identified the virus as one from india . 
russia is taking steps to protect itself . 
on may <num>10</num>  , it ordered any russian citizens in tajikistan to leave that country . 
on may <num>6</num>  , it banned tajik children under age <num>6</num>  from entering russia - until the end of the immunisation campaign ,  russian chief sanitary physician gennady onishchenko said . 
tajik officials cited the economic loss their farmers face and called a ban on fruit useless . 
poliomyelitis being a respiratory infection ,  our dried fruit cannot possibly transmit it ,  tajik foreign ministry spokesman davlat nazriyev said . 
most of this years exported fruit come from last years harvest ,  he added . 
meanwhile ,  tajikistan also is curbing travel by children . 
we are checking everyone entering tajikistan from afghanistan ,  pakistan and india and vaccinating all incoming children under <num>15</num>  at <abbr>…</abbr>  airports ,  railway stations and border checkpoints ,  tajik chief sanitary physician azam mirzoyev said . 
who specialists are co-operating with tajikistans neighbours to contain the virus . 
uzbekistan already has a problem - <num>23</num>  recorded cases of acute flaccid paralysis  ( a condition often associated with polio )  between january <num>1</num>  and april <num>28</num>  , according to the who . 
doctors have not yet isolated the polio virus from the uzbek cases ,  though . 
kyrgyzstan completed mass immunisations ;  afghanistan just began them . 
uzbekistan ,  kazakhstan and turkmenistan will follow suit . 
polio is endemic in only four countries today :  afghanistan ,  nigeria ,  india and pakistan ,  health officials said . 
after <num>5</num>  years ,  andijans survivors say theyre still persecuted
residents of andijan carry the body of a victim may <num>14</num>  , <num>2005</num>  , after uzbek government forces opened fire on protesters in the citys central square a day earlier . 
on the fifth anniversary of the massacre ,  the uzbek government stepped up security patrols in andijan and tashkent ,  and banned flower sales in some places to stop commemoration of the victims . 
andijan ,  uzbekistan -- the bloodshed ,  screams and cover-up are still bitter memories for the survivors of the andijan massacre five years after that fateful day . 
photographs lay on the table in front of her - images of a tranquil and happy life :  she and her husband ,  arif ,  and son ,  israfil ,  in tashkent . 
the family at a neighbours wedding . 
pictures of israfil as a baby in a childs striped outfit and in a polka-dot t-shirt . 
on may <num>12</num>  , <num>2005</num>  , hundreds of uzbeks assembled outside an andijan provincial court to demand the freeing of <num>23</num>  businessmen arrested in <num>2004</num>  on charges of belonging to the banned akromiya organisation . 
that night ,  supporters and relatives of the suspects stormed the prison and freed them . 
the rioters took hostages when they seized the oblast government building . 
emboldened ,  local residents then massed on the central square to vent their grievances . 
the government characterises the events of may <num>13</num>  , <num>2005</num>  , as suppression of terrorism and says the death toll was <num>187</num>  .
international human rights organisations have called the events a mass murder of innocents ,  and some put the death toll at <num>1,000</num>  .
andijan is a closed book in uzbekistan ,  said oleg sarapulov of the society of human rights of uzbekistan . 
those who open it lose their freedom . 
the government apparently intended to keep the book shut during the sensitive fifth anniversary . 
it issued no statements about andijan ,  and allegedly warned the media not to write about it . 
the days leading up to the anniversary saw increased security ,  according to the uzbek interior ministry . 
the national security service ,  police ,  customs service ,  armed forces and ministry for emergencies all operated on heightened alert . 
policemen with metal detectors stood at subway entrances in tashkent . 
walkways leading to the mourning mother monument in tashkent were closed for a month ,  opening only for the may <num>9</num>  victory day celebrations . 
policemen blocked anybody trying to lay flowers at the monument ,  activists say . 
security was heightened in andijan as well . 
policemen also warned some activists that it was better to stay home during the anniversary . 
nonetheless ,  activists abdullo tolzhiboi-ugli and viktoria bazhenova succeeded in laying flowers at the monument to valour . 
that came despite another step by tashkent authorities to try to erase memories of the tragedy :  activists said the government banned flower sales in many parts of the capital . 
i was among the hostages seized by rioters at the andijan oblast government building ,  said komil ,  an andijan resident . 
its impossible to forget those events ,  the smell of blood and gunpowder ,  which hung over my hometown . 
several times i was summoned to the security agencies and firmly advised not to talk about what i had seen . 
ive got a family ,  kids ,  i have an executive position . 
so i dont even bring up the topic at home . 
its already been five years that my family and i havent had a moment of peace ,  said bakhodir ,  an andijan resident whose son participated in the <num>2005</num>  demonstration . 
they keep summoning us to the police and demanding that we write explanations of what we know of our sons whereabouts ,  whether were in contact with him ,  whether were receiving money from him . 
our phones are bugged ;  sometimes ,  were followed when we leave home . 
theyve suggested more than once that my wife and i renounce our son . 
his wife - with their two teenage children - was afraid of persecution ,  so she had to divorce him and move in with her parents . 
i was told by the security agencies that if my daughter returned home ,  she wouldnt be touched ,  said munisa of andijan ,  whose daughter fled in <num>2005</num>  to kyrgyzstan and then to sweden . 
but prison is waiting for those who come back ,  like several of my acquaintances . 
dilorom abdukadirova ,  for example ,  returned from australia last january after receiving assurances she would not be prosecuted . 
but relatives and human rights watch said police arrested her upon her return ,  briefly released her ,  and then re-arrested and prosecuted her . 
she was allegedly tortured into admitting her guilt ,  and in april received a ten-year prison sentence for illegally leaving uzbekistan and trying to overthrow the government . 
foreign governments ,  which initially denounced the governments actions in andijan ,  have drawn criticism from human rights organisations for a perceived softening in their tone toward tashkent . 
amnesty international and human rights watch both issued statements marking the anniversary . 
they condemned the trials of andijan demonstrators and demanded international investigations . 
 " no matter how much time has passed ,  … an investigation has to be carried out "  ,  he said . 
release of nookat <num>32</num>  delayed
human rights advocate zhenish toroyev  ( right )  speaks to a relative of someone imprisoned for the <num>2008</num>  nookat protests . 
formalities in such a sensitive case may delay the promised release of those prisoners ,  toroyev said . 
 [ erkin kamalov ] 
osh -- relatives of <num>32</num>  prisoners convicted in the <num>2008</num>  nookat protests doubt kyrgyzstans interim government will fulfil its promise to pardon and free them . 
kyrgyz interim deputy chairman almazbek atambayev announced on tv april <num>29</num>  that the <num>32</num>  nookat district residents ,  convicted of organising mass riots october <num>1</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , during the muslim holiday of orozo-ait ,  would go free may <num>9</num>  , victory day . 
however ,  the day came and went ,  and all <num>32</num>  remain in prison . 
the <num>32</num>  received sentences of <num>9</num>  to <num>20</num>  years ,  which courts later reduced to <num>5</num>  to <num>17</num>  years ,  for what the government of then-president kurmanbek bakiyev said was a riot organised by militant islamists . 
those arrested said they were peacefully protesting the governments unwillingness to let them organise a public celebration of ramadans end and that the government attacked them . 
however ,  this does not mean they will immediately be released . 
reopening the case will reveal gross violations in the first investigation and will help the prisoners get a fair trial ,  suyunbayeva said . 
among the violations toroyev alleges were a lack of access to legal counsel ,  torture and coercion of defendants to testify against themselves . 
defence counsellors corroborated that two of the defendants ,  zaripa abdikarimova and labarhan saidaripova ,  had suffered from sophisticated torture and physical abuse . 
in order to extract confessions from them ,  they put gas masks on their heads and covered the vents ,  forced them to learn the national anthem and sing it five times a day instead of praying ,  placed them in solitary confinement and cut off their hair . 
the beatings might have caused abdikarimova to miscarry . 
eyewitnesses and copies of ambulance dispatches corroborated the torture . 
relatives of the prisoners initially welcomed the interim governments promise of release with joy ,  but some have lost heart . 
ive lost faith in the government ,  whether its permanent or temporary ,  said nurgul ,  sister of almazbek asanov . 
since atambayev promised they will be freed on may <num>9</num>  , let them fulfill the promise . 
if they didnt intend to ,  why did they scream on tv to the entire country that they will be amnestied ? 
time is passing ,  but my brother ,  almazbek asanov ,  continues to remain behind bars . 
they gave him <num>16</num>  years for nothing ,  and his health is deteriorating . 
in a telephone interview ,  a relative of one of the imprisoned women expressed hope that his sister would receive a pardon ,  saying she had no connection to radical islam . 
her praying five times a day to allah is no reason to toss her behind bars . 
and we are going to deal with those who subjected these weak women to physical violence ,  he said . 
we will not let this go so easily . 
osh law enforcement officers doubt the integrity of the convicted . 
when checking on these individuals ,  we found leaflets with anti-constitutional slogans and religious literature ,  said an investigator from osh oblasts department of internal affairs ,  who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
they contain ideas and calls for the construction of a caliphate in the fergana valley . 
this is enough to bring these people to trial . 
a self-acknowledged member of the banned hizb ut-tahrir group who gave his name as dilmurat recently told central asia online that some of the <num>32</num>  convicted for the nookat protest sympathise with his group and that their release would aid in building a caliphate in central asia . 
we are unaware of this intimidation ,  and this is nothing compared to citizens who wished to peacefully celebrate orozo-ait receiving incredibly long prison terms ,  said aziza abdirasulova ,  a human rights activist and director of the public organisation kylym shamy . 
the issue now awaits resolution at the highest level ,  she said . 
settlement of the legal technicalities could mean release of more than half of the nookat <num>32</num>  -- including the two women . 
however ,  interim government spokesman timur sharshenaliyev called for further study . 
most of the convicts are connected to religious extremism and will keep trying to undermine the countrys sovereignty ,  he said . 
first <num>10</num>  of nookat prisoners released in bishkek
former prisoners and family members meet in bishkek may <num>17</num>  after <num>10</num>  of the <num>32</num>  nookat prisoners were freed . 
the remaining <num>22</num>  are set to be released may <num>18</num>  .
bishkek - after weeks of delay ,  the interim government may <num>17</num>  released <num>10</num>  of <num>32</num>  prisoners convicted in the nookat protest of <num>2008</num>  , with the rest reportedly to go free may <num>18</num>  .
the ten emerged from prison at 6pm . 
they denied any connection to hizb ut-tahrir or to radical islam ,  and some said they did not know why police arrested them . 
i just went out to pray with everyone during the holiday - we were doing nothing wrong ,  said labarkhan saidaripova . 
in prison i gave birth to a daughter ,  and the conditions there were terrible . 
my husband ,  when he heard i was sentenced to <num>15</num>  years ,  died of a heart attack . 
our four children were left alone . 
the <num>32</num>  received sentences of <num>9</num>  to <num>20</num>  years for a protest in nookat october <num>1</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , after the government refused to allow a public celebration of the end of ramadan . 
the courts later reduced the sentences to <num>5</num>  to <num>17</num>  years . 
football federation member khatamzhan ismailov escorted those freed may <num>17</num>  from the chuiskaya oblast prison to the ombudsmans office in bishkek . 
he will travel with the group to nookat at the request of human rights advocates . 
rights activist nazgul urdubekova said that the children of the prisoners received help from activists . 
activists plan to seek a judicial pardon for the nookat prisoners ,  she said . 
dmitry kabak said the case has gone to the supreme court for review ,  but it was unclear how long the review would take . 
activists also plan to raise the issue of compensation for defamation of character . 
the decree releasing the prisoners was issued april <num>26</num>  , but contradictions in its text delayed their freedom ,  rights activists said . 
one article of the decree stated that only those convicted under a specific law would receive amnesty ,  while another part freed all the prisoners . 
in the end ,  authorities granted amnesty to all <num>32</num>  convicts . 
right activist aziza abdurasulova thanked the <num>32</num>  for their patience and said that they had all honourably borne allahs trial and should not harbour any ill will . 
everyone in the group seemed to agree there was no logical reason for their arrests . 
they all denied membership in hizb ut-tahrir and said that police arrested them so that then-president kurmanbek bakiyev could demonstrate his authority . 
we are all good muslims - no radicals ,  said one member of the group . 
one activist noted that of the <num>32</num>  prisoners convicted for the nookat incident ,  only <num>3</num>  are ethnic kyrgyz and the rest are ethnic uzbeks . 
perhaps the former government was trying to play the ethnic card ,  she said . 
the youngest of the <num>32</num>  , irgashev yakmatullo ,  was <num>17</num>  when police arrested him . 
another convict ,  abdylakhap masharipov ,  called his arrest an accident . 
that day i was digging potatoes in the garden ,  he said . 
i wasnt at home for two days . 
when they began the arrests ,  two people came and hid in our house . 
later the militia arrested them and asked me to come to the station . 
i thought i would be the witness ,  but was arrested along with them . 
kyrgyz instability possible window of opportunity for islamists
muslims worship during friday prayers may <num>15</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , in osh . 
instability in kyrgyzstan might encourage extremists to take advantage of the situation ,  analysts said . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
bishkek - post-uprising kyrgyzstan might become a hotbed for religious extremists ,  some analysts predict . 
the interim government rejects the interpretation that struggles within the spiritual administration might indicate the beginning of religious extremists fight for power . 
kanybek osmonaliyev ,  director of the state committee on religious affairs until his firing on may <num>14</num>  , said ,  muslim kyrgyz have never been that radical . 
but one anonymous source who formerly worked as an analyst in the bakiyev government said ,  any destabilisation in the country plays into the islamists hands . 
six months will go toward the countrys elections ,  the source said . 
in the spring  ( of <num>2011</num>  )  ,  radicals will begin some sort of open movements . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  in the beginning of <num>2012</num>  , amid dissatisfaction with the authorities potential inaction ,  there will be an armed coup . 
our sources tell us that in shaartuz and pyandzh ,  extremists came down from the more mountainous regions in april and tried to rally people to go to kyrgyzstans border ,  a representative of the tajik committee for national security said . 
but they arent as numerous as many people imagine . 
the uzbek national security council has information about certain  ( insurgent )  movements within the fergana valley from uzbekistan ,  an anonymous representative of that council said . 
given the worsening situation in kyrgyzstan ,  the islamists are likely to try to break into kyrgyzstans territory ,  where there is less control . 
he emphasised that he was referring to the imu and hizb ut-tahrir . 
the imu and hizb ut-tahrir will not join forces for the fight ,  malikov predicted . 
after all ,  these are different ideologies ,  political platforms and ways of achieving goals . 
hizb ut-tahrir operates through propaganda ,  while the imu uses armed seizure of power ,  said kyrgyz national university political scientist yevgeniya nuranskaya . 
kyrgyz foreign ministry diplomatic academy professor orozbek moldaliyev dismissed the possibility of radicals taking power . 
you need money to come to power ,  he said . 
the radicals dont have any now . 
secondly ,  they are more focused on <abbr>…</abbr>  afghanistan and pakistan . 
malikov has not ruled out that events in kyrgyzstan might be just what the fractured imu needs . 
the transfer of imu militants back to central asia began long before the overthrow ,  during last summer . 
many fighters returned to central asia and are ready to again take up the previous aim of building a caliphate . 
extremists are watching the situation in the country closely ,  malikov said . 
there is nothing to worry about ,  osmonaliyev said . 
the interim government is monitoring the situation . 
however ,  collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  countries have expressed concern . 
as a result ,  we will get a country with strong inter-clan and ,  consequently ,  inter-religious discord ,  the former bakiyev government analyst said . 
the authority needs to create a system that would directly link it to the countrys islamic centres and control them ,  he added . 
most urban kyrgyz are quite secular ,  moldaliyev said . 
i dont think they will tolerate having the imu or hizb ut-tahrir in the government ,  he added .

recruiters from radical groups target the relatives of arrestees and pressure them to avenge their loved ones . 
 [ tariq mahmood / afp / getty images ] 
then they began urging her to devote her life to avenging her husband . 
i took part in several <abbr>…</abbr>  demonstrations and distributed leaflets ,  zulfiya said . 
but they told me that i should be ready to sacrifice my life . 
zulfiyas parents and local mullah ahmad kori convinced her to refuse hizb ut-tahrirs assistance . 
i just explained the terrorists true motives and that they have no relation to islam ,  kori said . 
extremists recruit from various social strata ,  but they concentrate on university and religious-school graduates and youth from socially disadvantaged backgrounds ,  said an islamic university scholar who has studied extremist groups . 
after training a new member ,  the groups ask him or her to create party cells . 
they pay about us <num>50</num>  $  for each new member and us <num>100</num>  $ -<num>150</num>  for distribution of literature ,  the scholar said . 
thus ,  members have an incentive to recruit . 
radicals follow a strict hierarchy . 
it rises from disciple to sergeant to regional organisational leaders and finally to the council of directors-in-chief ,  the scholar said . 
relatives of imprisoned extremists are not the only ones recruited . 
former police officer hassan mahmudov ,  <num>29</num>  , received an eight-year prison sentence in <num>2005</num>  under uzbekistans article <num>156</num>  for incitement of ethnic ,  racial or religious hatred . 
he brought discs with religious films and audio tracks and invited me to watch ,  mahmudov said . 
over time ,  he believed the propaganda ,  he said . 
i began to blame those who held power in the country for all of my difficulties ,  mahmudov said . 
the president receives hundreds of such petitions every week ,  a source inside the office said . 
a mahmudov acquaintance on the presidential staff passed on his letters . 
some letters simply do not make it to the consideration stage ,  said the source . 
extremist groups rely on neuro-linguistic programming to persuade recruits ,  the security source said . 
nafisa hojayeva of andijan said a friend asked her to join hizb ut-tahrir . 
this happened after my divorce . 
i was crushed because here this is considered a disgrace to the family . 
i was told that my active involvement in the organisation would expunge the familys disgrace ,  she said . 
dissuasion is mostly the work of mosques and the government . 
preachers give sermons on the dangers of terrorist organisations at all mosques ,  the spiritual administration of muslims of uzbekistan  ( samu )  said . 
since people <abbr>…</abbr>  actively visit mosques and the clerics have authority ,  this public-awareness work is effective ,  said bokhodir choriyev ,  chairman of tashkents mahala committee . 
radio and tv also carry public-service ads . 
some argue ,  though ,  that more needs to be done . 
the institute of strategic and interregional studies created a legal framework for suppression of extremism . 
the interior ministry ,  state customs committee ,  defence ministry and ministry for emergencies all have anti-terrorist units . 
the country needs to fight incentives for becoming a terrorist -- financial instability and unemployment ,  an anonymous political analyst said . 
the educational system needs work ,  too ,  schoolteacher khalida valiyeva said . 
after the government dropped the soviet-era cyrillic alphabet in the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  the state was not able to print books in the latin alphabet that rapidly ,  and most of todays young people have grown up without classical literature ,  without heroes who could serve as models . 
an official at the samu who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed . 
when a niche in education and social protection freed up ,  radical <abbr>…</abbr>  organisations rushed to fill it "  . 
residents of flooded kulyab stay in tent city
kulyab residents carry bread to refugees living in the tent city . 
floods ravaged the town and killed at least <num>40</num>  residents ,  with <num>30</num>  still missing . 
the tebolai canal overflow carried them in . 
according to the committee for emergency situations and civil defence  ( cescd )  ,  the floods injured more than <num>200</num>  kulyab residents and left more than <num>5,000</num>  homeless . 
vose and shuroabad were also affected . 
we still have not found our youngest son ,  said maryam holova ,  <num>60</num>  .
i do not hold hope of seeing him alive . 
they say that only <num>40</num>  people were killed . 
that is not true . 
take a look :  every family has victims . 
residents blame <num>500</num>  kilogram -concrete slabs placed along the banks of the tebolai to prevent erosion . 
the water swept them in and smashed them down on kulyabs houses . 
the slabs were carried in by the water ,  and our homes suffered because of this ,  said mukim tolibov ,  <num>42</num>  .
the slabs took more than <num>250</num>  lives ,  faizaliyev said ,  citing the number of dead whom kulyab residents themselves counted . 
many were buried according to muslim law ,  said an anonymous source in the city administration . 
they were not sent to the morgue and were not recorded ;  hence ,  the difference between the official and unofficial statistics . 
on may <num>7</num>  , the government formed the state commission on the elimination of the disasters aftermath in kulyab and set up a tent city in the stadium . 
kulyab mayor hamid abdullayev said it has <num>650</num>  tents now . 
recent data ,  however ,  show it exceeds us <num>650</num>  . 
rakhmon ordered the government and large companies to use their own funds to build <num>500</num>  houses for the victims . 
we barely managed to prove that our house and all our property were destroyed ,  said said rasulova . 
 ( they )  said unscrupulous residents had come wanting to get a new house on our sorrow . 
construction has begun in kulyabs suburbs on a new housing development for the victims ,  said kulyab deputy mayor pirmad zaripov . 
dushanbes business owners are building <num>100</num>  houses ,  each of which will cost <num>100,000</num>  tjs  ( us <num>22,800</num>  $  )  including housewares . 
we began drawing lots among the victims to decide who would receive the first new residences . 
officials are conducting the lottery according to the number of tents in the temporary city . 
rustam emomali ,  son of the president ,  visited kulyab last week and promised to build two houses at his expense . 
on may <num>19</num>  , the tajik government appealed for us <num>19</num>  , in humanitarian aid . 
according to the un co-ordinators office in tajikistan ,  the appeal includes <num>26</num>  projects proposed by un agencies and ngos . 
some aid is arriving . 
 ( international organisations )  are handing out food in the tent cities . 
doctors from the world health organisation and representatives from other international institutions are working there around the clock ,  abdullayev said . 
but by all accounts ,  it will be a long road to recovery . 
human trafficking plagues tajikistan
a woman who applied for an overseas job but instead was forced into prostitution speaks to a journalist from a holding cell in the middle east . 
the problem of trafficking women from tajikistan and other cis countries continues . 
 [ un - iom ] 
khudzhand ,  tajikistan - nigor has begun a new life ,  but her nightmarish past still haunts her . 
clients kept coming and coming ,  nigor said ,  reflecting on her days of forced prostitution ,  after human traffickers sold her into slavery in the united arab emirates . 
i begged them to help me run away ,  but they laughed . 
in <num>2003</num>  , nigor was just <num>19</num>  and responded to an ad offering us <num>2,000</num>  $  per month for tourism work . 
she arrived in sharjah ,  where one of her new employers undressed and beat her . 
then the tajik woman  ( an intermediary )  came and said that i was now a prostitute . 
i owed them money for the trip and another us <num>10,000</num>  $  and i had to work it off . 
human trafficking took off in tajikistan after its <num>1992</num> -<num>1997</num>  civil war and subsequent economic decline ,  according to a report by the ngo angel . 
still ,  tajikistan has shown some improvement in terms of pursuing traffickers . 
a us state department trafficking report for <num>2009</num>  says in <num>2008</num>  tajik authorities reported investigating <num>23</num>  trafficking suspects  ( <num>12</num>  in <num>2007</num>  )  . 
the government reported <num>23</num>  prosecutions in <num>2008</num>   ( <num>19</num>  in <num>2007</num>  )  ,  with <num>17</num>  traffickers convicted in <num>2008</num>   ( <num>11</num>  in <num>2007</num>  )  . 
interior ministry spokesman mahmadullo asadulloyev said in <num>2009</num>  authorities investigated three trafficking-related cases ,  while so far registering none this year . 
the uae ,  kazakhstan ,  russia ,  thailand ,  turkey ,  india ,  israel ,  malaysia and south korea are destinations for tajik women forced into prostitution . 
uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan also have a serious human trafficking problem . 
the bad economy prompted more than <num>1</num>  meter  tajiks  ( the countrys population is <num>7</num>  meter  )  to leave in the past three years ,  human rights watch reported . 
on the pretext of providing good work ,   ( traffickers )  ship people abroad and sell them into slavery ,  lawyer shukhrat kudratov said . 
indifference to the law <abbr>…</abbr>  leads to such consequences . 
some international groups praise the countrys efforts to combat the problem . 
tajikistan has good laws <abbr>…</abbr>  and a special department for fighting trafficking ,  dushanbe-based osce anti-trafficking officer graziella piga said ,  referring to the inter-agency commission on combating trafficking in human beings . 
law enforcement has solved dozens of crimes tied to modern forms of slavery ,  tajik ambassador to the un sirojiddin aslov said . 
hundreds of victims have returned home ,  he added . 
but they did not help nigor . 
for two years we searched for her . 
no one helped . 
my husband suffered two heart attacks ,  said halilda ,  nigors mother . 
nigor said she had to save herself . 
once ,  i asked a client to take me to another street ;  i said that i was going to a store . 
when i left the car ,  i ran to the police ,  she said . 
i was in the emirates illegally ,  so i spent two months in jail and then they deported me . 
her ordeal continued in tajikistan ,  she said ,  recalling that police dragged  ( me )  off to the interrogation rooms . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  they often ridiculed and scorned me . 
the fact that most authorities are untrained in how to interact with trafficking victims is a widespread problem ,  cited in the us state departments trafficking in persons report <num>2009</num>  .
police are now being trained how to treat trafficking victims . 
the government and the un differ on how well tajikistan is handling the problem . 
asadulloev said trafficking numbers are down ,  though . 
however ,  a <num>2009</num>  report from the un office on drugs and crime criticised tajikistan for failing to comply with standards for the elimination of trafficking and for making no progress in convicting government officials who are involved in trafficking . 
observers advance a number of remedies . 
closer iom co-operation with the government and the establishment of a ministry of labour migration are two . 
the interior ministry migration service is establishing contact with the arab countries ,  which ,  in the future ,  will allow us to officially find work for our citizens and to be aware of their whereabouts ,  asadulloev said . 
meanwhile ,  tajikistan has to deal with the fact that the economic crisis will make trafficking worse ,  kudratov predicted . 
this is an organised-crime group <abbr>…</abbr>  with a well-thought-out scheme ,  and it has connections everywhere in government ,  he said . 
that makes it tough for victims to find justice . 
when nigor got back ,  we tried to find the company that sent her to the uae ,  but it had vanished without a trace ,  her mother said . 
they later found them - as the investigator told me . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  but then everything was hushed up ,  said nigor . 
they got off scot-free ,  but i have no life . 
thats because the victimization continues when the victims return home . 
we are outcasts ,  she said . 
society must change its attitude toward us ,  must understand that it is not our fault "  . 
kyrgyz revolution sends foreign tourists elsewhere
children play volleyball at cholpon-ata beach . 
kyrgyz tourism might suffer this year - as it did in <num>2005</num>  , the year of the preceding popular uprising . 
 [ alisher karimov ] 
yaroslava melnikova of novokuznetsk russia has vacationed several times at lake issyk-kul . 
she set up a trip for this year but cancelled after the april events . 
i planned to fly in july ,  and back in march reserved my package like usual ,  she said . 
but <abbr>…</abbr>  my mother told me to cancel everything . 
they say that looters were roaming the resorts too . 
id better go to turkey this time . 
the events of april <num>7</num> -<num>8</num>  and the ensuing turmoil will hit tourism first . 
that year ,  the number of guests fell to one-fifth of its normal level ,  said nina afonina ,  owner of a cholpon-ata guesthouse . 
usually ,  during the summer ,  i have an average of ten to <num>12</num>  people living here ,  but that year four out of five rooms were empty ,  she remembered . 
almost all of the lakeshore population lives the entire year on the money it earns during the summer tourist season . 
the owners and staff of hotels ,  resorts and guesthouses on the shores of issyk-kul are suffering . 
investment in tourism declined sharply between <num>2004</num>  and <num>2005</num>  , falling from <num>1.65</num>  billion kgs  ( us <num>1.65</num>  )  to <num>979.3</num>  meter  kgs  ( us <num>979.3</num>  meter  )  ,  the state agency for tourism said . 
tourism revenue dropped by <num>50</num>  %  between <num>2004</num>  and <num>2005</num>  after growing <num>10</num>  %  annually for several years . 
now we have the lowest possible prices . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  we did large-scale repairs and bought expensive medical and sports equipment . 
we hope this will help us to survive a difficult year . 
german eremin ,  a novosibirsk businessman ,  tried to open a tourist resort in kyrgyzstan after falling in love with issyk-kul in <num>2004</num>  .
my partners and i decided to buy or build a small hotel on the lakeshore ,  but a revolution forced us to postpone this idea ,  eremin said . 
at the beginning of this year ,  we returned to the project ,  but again the government was replaced - this time with blood being spilt . 
maybe we will invest our capital in something else . 
in <num>2006</num>  , foreign tourists provided us <num>2006</num>  , to the federal budget ,  compared to us <num>2006</num>  , in <num>2005</num>  .
that number reached us <num>2005</num>  . in <num>2008</num>  , the last year for which statistics are available . 
khalitov hopes tourists from kazakhstan and the siberian region of russia will still come . 
they saw that everything worked out in <num>2005</num>  .
reports of looting of resorts along the shores are unfounded ,  he said . 
there have been a few criminal clashes ,  but there have not been any riots . 
timur esenaliyev ,  manager of the hotel aurora ,  said media reports that looters had ransacked the establishment were wrong . 
there were no seizures . 
the employees themselves organised volunteer patrols and kept watch ,  but no one even tried to rob us . 
but not all observers are optimistic . 
the year might turn out to be a flop like <num>2005</num>  , predicted kuban ashirkulov ,  chairman of the international business council . 
remedying the situation will be tough ,  he said . 
the tourism industry is asking the interim government to waive visa requirements for citizens of <num>45</num>  different countries and to restore order to customs and border checkpoints ,  but something more fundamental needs to be fixed ,  he said . 
until the political situation stabilises ,  it will be hard to talk about the flow of tourists ,  he said . 
owners of issyk-kul hotels and resorts are counting on kazakhstani tourists ,  their steadiest customers ,  and low prices . 
the auroras prices have remained the same as last year ,  despite increases in overhead ,  said yesenaliyev . 
the interim government has not yet turned its attention to tourism . 
the new government doesnt care about tourism ,  meaning that the industry somehow will have to manage without badly needed government help ,  ashirkulov said . 
he added bakiyevs shifting of responsibility for tourism from a dedicated agency to a department inside a ministry left the industry without a clearly defined overseer . 
tourism operators took heart april <num>27</num>  , though ,  when emil umetaliyev became acting minister of economic regulation . 
he owns kyrgyz concept ,  a leading player in the tourism industry . 
ashirkulov ,  sceptical of the governments attitude toward tourism ,  was more positive about umetaliyev . 
 ( he )  knows the industrys problems perfectly well . 
he should be able to work them out . 
kyrgyz migrants prepare to board a bishkek-moscow train . 
migrant work is seen as a contributor to the spread of hiv . 
osh - a month ago ,  aziz discovered he was infected with hiv . 
i had to get tested anonymously at a local clinic ,  where i learned of my illness ,  he said . 
last autumn ,  aziz ,  <num>28</num>  , returned from his job in russia . 
he discovered his infection after his pregnant wife tested positive . 
he initially battled depression ,  he said . 
he begged his wife for forgiveness ,  but she returned to her parents . 
akbagysheva said <num>300,000</num> -<num>400,000</num>  kyrgyz  ( out of a population of <num>5.3</num>  meter  )  are migrants . 
the number of hiv carriers in kyrgyzstan is growing because of extensive travel . 
by may <num>1</num>  , kyrgyzstan had registered <num>2,929</num>  hiv carriers ,  <num>714</num>  of whom were women . 
of those ,  <num>47</num>  %  were ages <num>20</num> -<num>29</num>  and <num>38</num>  %  were <num>30</num> -<num>40</num>  , akbagysheva said . 
however ,  doctors have detected hiv in juveniles too . 
moreover ,  sexual transmission infects women three times more often than men . 
many of these women are not in population groups with high-risk behaviour but were infected by their husbands . 
we came to the conclusion that among men ,  migrant workers are precisely the ones primarily spreading hiv ,  said nadezhda oliferenko ,  a psychologist at the public foundation master radosti . 
therein ,  not only they ,  but also their families ,  suffer . 
we try to <abbr>…</abbr>  restore their spiritual balance . 
within the framework of the state hiv / aids epidemic prevention programme and its strategy <num>2</num> -<num>6</num>   ( decreasing vulnerability to hiv / aids among mobile groups of the population )  ,  the government has sought to teach mobile population groups about the disease . 
the initiative includes information on the spread of hiv ;  the need for condoms and treatment ;  the absence of preventative programmes ;  the massive and disruptive nature of population movements ;  lack of access to health care ;  and the legal status of these groups . 
one of the major problems leading to hiv infection is the immense scale of population movements ,  oliferenko said . 
job-seekers go abroad in legions . 
there ,  they neglect to use prophylactics . 
aziz was considering working abroad but faces a new problem :  russia requires workers to pass a medical test . 
but i cannot pass it <abbr>…</abbr>  because i am already hiv positive ,  aziz said . 
i am thinking about going illegally because my wife will soon give birth and i have to support her and our child . 
more than <num>60</num>  countries impose entry or residence restrictions on hiv carriers ,  akbagysheva said . 
they may refuse entry to international migrant workers or deport them <abbr>…</abbr>  if their hiv-positive status becomes known ,  akbagysheva said . 
migrants occupy a vulnerable position <abbr>…</abbr>  in the host society ,  which stems from common factors like language barriers and differences in conceptions of health and disease . 
master radosti tries to teach migrant workers . 
we go to bus stations ,  private taxi stops and the train stations ,  where we work with those who are planning to go abroad for jobs ,  said nemat muminov ,  an outreach worker for the group . 
they discuss preventative conduct and distribute educational brochures to migrants . 
the organisation also operates a hotline on hiv prevention for migrant workers . 
this approach benefits family relations ,  she said . 
the public foundation belyi zhuravl also conducts hiv / aids-prevention programmes for migrant workers ,  freight and passenger-transport drivers ,  market traders and their family members . 
because of the particular mentality  ( here )  ,  women fear that this  ( testing )  will result in negative consequences for them . 
and ,  as it often happens ,  women may be accused of wanton ways ,  he said . 
tajiks protest toll highway
motorists line up to pay the toll near varzob village . 
the dushanbe-chanak tollway is the only road connecting the north to the capital . 
 [ nazim kalandarov ] 
dushanbe - the recent decision to charge a toll on the dushanbe-chanak highway in tajikistan - the sole road connecting the capital with the countrys north - has caused vigorous protests from local residents . 
observers are concerned major unrest might flare up - like that in talas ,  which ended up toppling kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev in april . 
varzob is a village along tajikistans first toll highway ,  which connects dushanbe and chanak . 
since april <num>1</num>  , car owners have had to pay <num>30</num>  dirams  ( us <num>0.06</num>  $  )  per kilometre . 
that toll can be stiff in a country with a per capita annual gdp of us <num>720</num>  $  in <num>2009</num>  .
the tolling system can force a driver who goes a kilometre to pay as much as someone driving <num>97</num>  kilometer  . 
distances between the seven toll plazas vary . 
the tajik branch of the british contractor innovative road solutions  ( irs )  ,  which took control of the payments ,  imposed the toll . 
tajikistan has borrowed more than us <num>1.5</num>  $  billion over the past ten years to rebuild major highways ,  company deputy cto rustam abdulloyev told reporters . 
the country cannot afford to pay for road maintenance ,  he said . 
if that highway were neglected for just a couple of years ,  the us <num>1.5</num>  $  road maintenance loan from china would go down the drain . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  the road would be useless by the end of the winter . 
the chinese have contracted to supply irs with road maintenance equipment worth us <num>1.5</num>  $  ,  abdulloyev said . 
i cant sell them at a loss ,  so ill have to raise the price ,  buston resident khikmatulloh karimov said bitterly . 
and driving <abbr>…</abbr>  to see my relatives will cost me money ,  too . 
the company earned about us <num>100,000</num>  $  per toll plaza in april ,  he estimated . 
irs is exempt from all taxes except the social welfare tax it withholds from employees salaries . 
the company is refusing to submit documents showing how much it earned and how large the toll cuts may be ,  ashur said . 
company chief financial officer zoirshoh kosimov declined to disclose the amount of money collected since april <num>1</num>  , calling it a trade secret . 
many politicians and observers oppose the tolls . 
besides ,  why charge a fee for the use of a highway that is still unfinished ? 
drivers should have to pay only for passage through the maihur ,  istiklol and shahristan tunnels ,  said tajik communist leader shodi shabdolov . 
there is a bypass route above those tunnels . 
anyone should be free to decide whether to drive all the way via the mountain pass free of charge or pay to  ( use )  the tunnel . 
mahmadsharif nozimov ,  who represents the ruling peoples democratic party in parliament ,  described the imposition of tolls as coercion . 
since we live in the mountains <abbr>…</abbr>  we must  ( pay )  - we just have no other choice . 
introduction of the toll again has separated the centre of tajikistan from the north ,  political scientist abdugani mamadazimov said . 
for several decades ,  the zeravshan valley was  ( cut off by )  the snowfalls that would seal off the mountain passes in winter ,  he said . 
now people are finding themselves under a new - toll-related - transport blockade . 
there must be some local high-ranking officials <abbr>…</abbr>  giving irs a free hand to act the way it does ,  an anonymous tajik economist said . 
while varzob residents are humbly bearing the additional financial burden ,  people in sogd oblast are unlikely to behave as patiently ,  he said . 
one cannot exclude that the matchin district <abbr>…</abbr>  may become another talas . 
northerners have long felt separated <abbr>…</abbr>  from the rest of the nation . 
meanwhile ,  the transport ministry has said three more toll highways without free alternatives are coming . 
the dushanbe-kulyab highway toll is scheduled to take effect before the year ends . 
bishkek - alymbek just transferred to a school in another district because i might have gotten into big trouble if id stayed . 
each time he failed to pay ,  they would beat me up and show me a knife ,  threatening to cut me up ,  he said . 
the head of a public education centre ,  speaking on condition of anonymity ,  said mistrust of the authorities makes it difficult for victims to fight back . 
my parents then filed a report with the police ,  who demanded evidence ,  he recalled . 
what kind of evidence could i possibly present ? 
crimes committed by minors have been growing ever more serious ,  juvenile delinquency inspector ernis zhapakov of the zhaiyl district police department ,  chui oblast ,  said . 
boys have been carrying clubs ,  knives and firearms ,  zhapakov said . 
he recalled a may incident in karabalta ,  where older students assembled for a rumble after two boys quarrelled in the gym one day earlier . 
four teenagers were taken to hospital with bad gunshot wounds . 
pollsters at the bishkek-based el pikir centre for study of public opinion say one-third of students agreed that gangs exist . 
the reasons for delinquency vary . 
some blame political and economic instability . 
parents and teachers accuse each other of failing to disciple the children . 
police say the children learn the behaviour by watching adults . 
finger-pointing between parents and teachers is rampant . 
why pin all the blame on us teachers ? 
after all ,  upbringing and education are primarily the parents job ,  protested a karabalta teacher who requested anonymity . 
the worst thing is that each juvenile group turns into a well-organised gang ,  suggesting that adult criminals may be behind it ,  zhapakov said . 
that has consequences . 
after a boy admitted on a tv talk show that his high school has gangs ,  he was beaten up the next day ,  she explained . 
crime began to soar in the <num>1990</num>  second  after the soviet union collapsed ,  the karabalta teacher said . 
intellectuals ,  including teachers and doctors ,  found themselves penniless ,  whereas economic speculators - at one time the dregs of society - joined the rich and respected business elite ,  she said . 
mangistau oblast is offering police kzt <num>1</num>  meter  to improve their work . 
the new incentive is causing some to worry about increased corruption among police . 
 [ yelena kalinina ] 
mangistau oblast ,  kazakhstan -- the governors office of mangistau oblast in kazakhstan has pledged kzt <num>1</num>  meter   ( us <num>6,500</num>  $  )  to police officers who distinguish themselves in fighting crime . 
if you want to become a millionaire ,  be decent ,  carryout your duties with excellence ,  serving your nation honourably ,  and you will be certain to win it ,  akim krymbek kusherbayev said
our prize is a powerful incentive to the police . 
colleagues from other law enforcement agencies have been asking the governor :  why not us ? 
because it is the police who are in direct contact with the people ,  kabylov said . 
the practise has generated mixed reaction . 
police officers ,  who do a difficult job for a meagre salary  ( the average salary ranges from us <num>250</num>  $ -<num>300</num>  per month ,  depending on where one works )  ,  are surely in need of support ,  agreed alexander mukha ,  director of the mangistau branch of the international human rights and law enforcement bureau . 
the reward will give them an incentive to work harder . 
on the other hand ,  mukha is concerned the selection process may turn out to be overly opaque . 
the winners are selected taking into account feedback from the community ,  he said . 
in principle ,  neighbourhood officers must treat all people in their neighbourhood respectfully . 
if a persons moral standards are low ,  no monetary bonus will help ,  ever ,  said retired police officer nurbol makashev . 
… financial injections can hardly ever raise morale . 
the idea of rewarding police officers is great ,  although i am not absolutely sure it will work . 
police officers disagree with the critics . 
other plans include purchasing a satellite telephone and an air-conditioner and renovating the station . 
the other prize winners said they would use the money for personal needs . 
gulzaida toleugaliyeva ,  chief spokeswoman for the mangistau oblast interior department ,  brushed aside allegations of potential corruption . 
she said the decision to reward police officers for good service dates to <num>2008</num>  and members of the commission for naming the winners were carefully selected . 
besides ,  the commission members must be fully independent and not subordinated to one another at their workplaces . 
according to the terms and conditions  ( of the contest )  ,  the winners ,  apart from positive references from local residents ,  must show real ,  officially documented indicators of work efficiency ,  she added . 
each nominee has to take an exam ,  use tables and charts to report on work done ,  and answer a number of questions ,  toleugaliyeva said . 
the mangistau oblast interior department has not been the best among kazakhstans law enforcement units ,  she said . 
the new competition may be one more way to improve the efficiency of its officers performance . 
access to information in central asia still a problem
tajiks browse through the morning newspapers in dushanbe in this file photo . 
government restrictions in some central asian countries limit access to information . 
 [ nozim kalandarov ] 
dushanbe - restrictions on access to information remain a challenge for central asian journalists . 
kyrgyzstan ,  kazakhstan and tajikistan offer relatively satisfactory access ,  international observers say ,  unlike uzbekistan and turkmenistan ,  where official information is practically impossible to obtain . 
tamara kiselyova ,  chairperson of the kazakhstani ngo adil soz ,  sees media access to information as a shared concern for all of central asia ,  with the only difference being the severity of the problem and the degree to which a country has solved it . 
article <num>20</num>  of the kazakhstani constitution enshrines the right to freely gather information by any legal means ,  with the exception of state secrets . 
the media law stipulates the same . 
adil soz annually registers over <num>100</num>  refusals by agencies to share information with the press . 
or else you will be barred from attending a public event for security reasons . 
in tajikistan ,  the laws on television and radio broadcasting and on the press and other media require government agencies and officials to provide the journalists with any unclassified information . 
article <num>25</num>  of the information law bans restriction of access to public information . 
a reporter for a russian news agency accredited in tajikistan ,  who requested anonymity ,  said the most difficult task is to obtain the latest information : 
still more often ,  journalists inquiries are simply ignored . 
between <num>2005</num>  and <num>2009</num>  , the number of registered information denials decreased from <num>115</num>  to <num>26</num>  , nuridin karshiboyev ,  president of the national association of the independent media of tajikistan ,  said . 
the criminal code of tajikistan punishes denial of information to citizens  ( article <num>148</num>  )  and interference with journalists professional activities  ( article <num>162</num>  )  . 
however ,  prosecutors have never opened a case under those articles . 
access to information in kyrgyzstan is relatively free by central asian standards ,  international organisations say . 
we see it as one of our priorities to protect journalists rights and facilitate their work ,  interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva told journalists in <abbr>may.</abbr> 
while the situation here is better than elsewhere in the region ,  we are still a far cry from meeting international standards ,  a kyrgyz journalist said anonymously . 
after  ( kurmanbek )  bakiyev came to power ,  the journalists who supported  [ previous president ]  askar akayev found themselves in disfavour ,  just as bakiyevs supporters did after otunbayeva took the helm . 
the latest example is the fate of channel five ,  a reference to a tv station that the government has announced it plans to nationalise . 
vyacheslav abramov ,  a central asian observer ,  called the media position in uzbekistan grave . 
but abdulaziz abdullayev ,  director of the pro-government public fund to support and develop uzbekistans independent print media and news agencies ,  said the government has created a beneficial environment for journalists work :  a parliamentary commission was set up in <num>2008</num>  to manage the fund for supporting ngos and other civil society institutions . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  the commission has financed a variety of socially significant projects <abbr>…</abbr> 
the turkmen medias performance is still regulated by <abbr>…</abbr>  the law on the print and other media in the turkmen ssr passed back in <num>1991</num>  , said a turkmen reporter who requested anonymity . 
in the absence of new regulations ,  it is impossible to say how much time a government agency may take to provide information requested by a journalist . 
turkmenistan is the only cis member state completely lacking independent newspapers ,  magazines ,  radio and television stations ,  and news agencies ,  the journalist remarked . 
central asian government officials need to understand that as public personalities their activities must be transparent and subject to public scrutiny ,  said osce media freedom representative dunya miyatovic . 
in our setting ,  personal connections are far more effective - but even they dont always help ,  sariyev said . 
kyrgyz agriculture suffers after uprising
farmers in osh oblast prepare for planting . 
kyrgyz food prices are expected to go up this fall because of the spring uprising ,  which disrupted delivery of products needed to begin planting . 
 [ bakyt ibraimov ] 
bishkek - kyrgyzstans spring of discontent has exacted a heavy toll on its agriculture . 
former president kurmanbek bakiyevs ouster and the protracted closure of the border with kazakhstan disrupted deliveries of fuel ,  fertiliser and seed . 
observers predict stagnation in agriculture ,  a sector responsible for a quarter of the countrys gdp . 
during the april unrest the countrys farming-dependent regions froze like a computer for several days running - a period meaning a lot in agriculture ,  said kubanychbek idinov ,  an economist at kyrgyzstan national university . 
farmers waited weeks for kazakhstan to re-open the border so that they could receive supplies . 
but acting finance minister temir sariyev does not expect any problems with this years harvest . 
the sowing campaign has proceeded at a satisfactory rate . 
whatever fuel and fertiliser problems we had have been gradually resolved ,  he said . 
at least one farmer feels otherwise . 
mamat nazaraliyev of chui oblast ,  said problems began piling up in mid-april . 
suppliers said the border was closed ,  so the prices of petroleum products soared ,  he recalled . 
diesel oil ,  for example ,  cost <num>25</num>  kgs  ( us$0 . 54 )  per litre on april <num>10</num>  , but <num>35</num>  kgs  ( us$0 . 76 )  ten days later and could be purchased only through personal connections . 
russia levied new custom duties on petroleum product exports ,  said an anonymous source at the ministry of agriculture . 
kazakhstan did not raise price but said it was short of fuel tanks - and stopped deliveries in early <abbr>may.</abbr> 
russia and kazakhstan are negotiating now with kyrgyzstan ,  he added . 
meanwhile ,  kyrgyzstan has arranged with kazakhstan and russia for humanitarian fuel deliveries . 
to complete spring planting ,  the farmers need a total of <num>34,500</num>  tonnes of fuel ,  acting agriculture minister kubat kaseyinov said . 
of these ,  <num>26,700</num>  tonnes had been purchased before the april events ,  and <num>3,700</num>  tonnes have come from kazakhstan ,  via gazproms pipelines . 
the resulting deficit of about <num>4,000</num>  tonnes is to be covered by russia . 
but the fuel shortage is worse than officially described and spring planting is less than half-completed nationwide ,  some farmers said . 
this assistance from kazakhstan and russia will hardly be helpful . 
weve had many assistance requests from farmers who cannot even start their work properly . 
the state material reserve fund was unable to help with the fuel shortage . 
the <num>7,000</num>  tonnes of petroleum products held by the fund turned out to be contaminated with water ,  kaseyinov said . 
nor did the fund alleviate the fertiliser and seed shortages ,  an anonymous agriculture ministry source said . 
kyrgyzstan does not produce fertiliser domestically ,  and state-controlled uzbek and russian manufacturers supplied only <num>40</num>  %  of demand - <num>80,000</num>  of <num>200,000</num>  tonnes . 
farmers are too short of cash to buy enough fertiliser ,  the source said . 
the bakiyev government promised to issue grants for that purpose ,  but many farmers never received that money . 
to deal with the problem ,  the agriculture ministry and ecologists are proposing a shift from mineral to natural and organic fertilisers . 
they intend to form a non-governmental agro-ecological association to review the matter . 
the agriculture ministry has promised to support the association . 
however ,  vyacheslav naumov ,  the associations likely leader ,  is not optimistic about what it can accomplish in the near future . 
fortunately ,  the interim government is to receive us <num>405,000</num>  $  from the un to buy fertilizer ,  kaseyinov said . 
the perennial seed shortages are worse this year :  local seed is poor and farmers have to buy the bulk of their seed in kazakhstan ,  said kemal satybekov of the bishkek-based institute of agriculture . 
this years closure of the border with that country forced farmers to sow local seeds and what remained from last year . 
this years assistance from russia - over <num>2,500</num>  tonnes of grain seeds - came too late and will be kept in reserve for next season ,  satybekov said . 
zhumakadyr akeneyev ,  a former agriculture minister ,  expects farmers to need to raise money for <num>2011</num>  spring planting as early as this autumn . 
the costs of farming crops have grown ,  so prices will go up accordingly . 
we anticipate inflation at <num>15</num> -<num>20</num>  %  . 
he stressed that price rises will not affect all crops . 
in kyrgyzstan we produce only <num>10</num>  %  of our needs ,  with the rest imported from kazakhstan . 
since our farmers have not spent anything on producing sugar in kazakhstan ,  its price is bound to remain unchanged . 
the risk group will include almost all cereals ,  vegetables and locally grown fruit ,  economists predicted . 
we grow three times more potatoes than we need ,  the anonymous agriculture ministry source said . 
the rest will be exported . 
but our farmers are not going to risk raising the prices they charge kazakhs . 
most likely ,  our people will bear most of the burden . 
taliban leadership disagreements ,  in-fighting grow
kabul -- after the arrest of the afghan talibans top deputy ,  mullah abdul ghani baradar ,  in february ,  the two new deputies to mullah omar are struggling to fill his shoes and lead the fighters in afghanistan . 
in fact ,  mullah abdul qayum zakir and mullah akhtar mohammad mansoor are now reportedly involved in a power struggle against each other . 
afghan officials in helmand province have even said that militants loyal to the two are fighting to decide who will replace baradar . 
based on our information ,  fighters loyal to zakir have armed clashes with mansoors supporters ,  daud ahmadi ,  spokesman for helmand governor ,  told central asia online . 
 ( a )  power struggle and money-making is the only cause of the rift . 
ahmadi said that most senior taliban commanders who once fought out of conviction now want to see more financial benefits . 
mansoor ,  who served as civil aviation and transportation minister during the talibans reign from <num>1996</num>  to <num>2001</num>  , has been recognized as an opium trader in provinces bordering pakistan ,  according to interpol . 
in <num>2007</num>  he was made shadow governor in kandahar . 
afghanistans defence ministry has noticed some changes in the talibans command structure . 
according to the reports ,  mullah zakir is now responsible for military operations after his rival was placed in charge of logistics . 
ahmadi said changes in the taliban leadership have resulted in some policy changes in helmand province . 
its been two weeks since the taliban leadership ordered the immediate murder and hanging of people whom  ( it )  recognizes of spying or helping the afghan and international forces in helmand province ,  ahmadi said . 
the <num>7</num> -year-old child  ( executed last week )  in sangeen district of helmand could be an example of  ( this )  recent decision . 
jihad is worship and there is no problem in the taliban leadership ,  taliban spokesman ,  qari yusaf ahmadi told central asia online by telephone from an undisclosed location . 
this is a kind of western propaganda and they dont have any evidence regarding this issue . 
he also denied the execution of the <num>7</num> -year-old boy in helmand . 
the fergana . 
ru news agency reports that the abaysky district prosecutor's office in shymkent ,  capital city of the south kazakhstan region ,  has terminated the activities of a protestant missionary organisation in recent days . 
a special administrative court sentenced the ten men in the organisation to twenty-four hours in jail . 
the female missionaries were required to pay fines of more than <num>400</num>  $   [ usd ]  . 
the organisation's leader was also slapped with a <num>100</num>  $  fine . 
all missionaries were expelled from kazakhstan . 
ethnic uzbek refugees try to cross the kyrgyz-uzbek border near the village of vlksm ,  <num>20</num>  kilometer  outside osh ,  june <num>18</num>  .
the who estimates that the crisis in kyrgyzstan affected up to <num>1</num>  meter  residents ,  about a third of whom could be refugees . 
the tragic june events in southern kyrgyzstan alarmed central asia and the global community . 
three days of widespread violence might have killed as many as <num>2,000</num>  and created <num>400,000</num>  refugees . 
several districts in osh and dzhalal-abad lie in ruins ,  according to official reports . 
the worst of the violence is over ,  but a humanitarian catastrophe looms as refugees languish in camps along the border and in uzbekistan . 
similar events struck the region <num>20</num>  years ago in june <num>1990</num>  , though on a smaller scale . 
soviet forces managed to stop the bloodshed . 
observers long warned of a possible repeat ,  particularly after aprils ouster of president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  a native of the south . 
the uzbek diaspora ,  which predominantly inhabits the souths largest cities and focuses on commerce ,  has historically done better economically than its rural kyrgyz counterparts . 
wealth ,  however ,  was not the main source of tension ;  politics was . 
kyrgyzstan has the worlds largest uzbek diaspora - more than <num>1</num>  meter  - constituting a fifth of the countrys population ,  according to some estimates . 
uzbek leaders in kyrgyzstan have repeatedly advocated cultural development . 
as a result ,  uzbek schools ,  universities ,  radio and television channels ,  cultural centres and theatres have opened in each of the souths large cities . 
the government also promoted local self-governance . 
periodic calls to establish uzbek as an official language have created tension ,  however . 
such worries informed the states efforts to promote cultural development through former president askar akayevs programme kyrgyzstan ,  our common home . 
the <num>2005</num>  tulip revolution led to a de-emphasis of such steps ,  with the government focusing instead on a composite nation and promoting the study of kyrgyz . 
the opposition ,  led by roza otunbayeva ,  took power april <num>7</num>  , after demonstrations and bloodshed . 
deposed president bakiyev ,  who had taken refuge in his hometown in dzhalal-abad oblast ,  attempted to restore the former government with his entourage on april 12th . 
many southern kyrgyz regard batyrov with suspicion ,  accusing him of favouring the elevation of uzbek to an official language and of urging uzbek political mobilisation . 
a crowd of young kyrgyz men marched april <num>19</num>  on peoples friendship university in dzhalal-abad ,  founded by batyrov ,  demanding an apology . 
the ensuing riot led to at least two deaths . 
the government promised to press criminal charges against batyrov for incitement of ethnic hatred . 
batyrov publicly apologised to the kyrgyz people before going into hiding . 
the south was primed to explode . 
not helping matters were the weakness of the interim government ,  numerous small-scale incidents ,  and the erosion of respect for the rule of law after two presidents' overthrows in five years . 
however ,  the speed with which the violence spread has observers saying it was planned . 
ethnic uzbeks complain that men in uniform - soldiers and police - sided with ethnic kyrgyz rioters ,  while the interim government accuses bakiyev supporters of inflaming the conflict in order to discredit the government before the june <num>27</num>  referendum . 
yet another school of thought argues that religious radicals may have played a role . 
organisations such as the islamic movement of turkestan  ( formerly the islamic movement of uzbekistan )  and hizb ut-tahrir seek to build an islamic state in central asia . 
for them ,  kyrgyzstan in its disarray has become the weakest link of the region's five secular governments . 
thus ,  two communities ,  kyrgyz and uzbek ,  who lived side by side for generations may find themselves hostage to others' agendas . 
understanding this threat will enable the central asian governments to contain the crisis and to prevent a confrontation between kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan . 
the future of kyrgyzstan and the region depends on the ability of ordinary people not to succumb to the blandishments of those with ulterior motives .

kyrgyz interior ministry dissolves ninth department
the ninth department of the ministry of internal affairs is abolished ,  acting interior minister bolot sher said . 
 [ aibek karabyev ] 
bishkek - new authorities have abolished the ninth department ,  accusing its staff of gathering compromising information on the opposition . 
officially ,  the interior ministry department was assigned to fight religious extremism and illegal immigration ,  but acting interior minister bolot sher accused them of going beyond that mission . 
tracking opposition journalists and spying on members of the opposition were both their  ( ninth department personnels )  jobs ,  sher told central asia online . 
now we are determining to what extent they may be implicated in attacks on journalists last year . 
the department only duplicated the state national security service  ( snss ) s functions ,  analysts said . 
the fight against terrorism is the special services prerogative . 
the ninth department operated for four years and its staff attended dozens of seminars and workshops ,  including osce and collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  sessions . 
no one thought about the fact that real professionals who worked according to western models worked there . 
the snss does not have that calibre of people . 
ngos have criticized shers decision . 
i often saw them in the courtroom . 
i think that the compromising information leaked on omurbek tekebayev and others under  ( kurmanbek )  bakiyev was the work of the ninth department . 
it fought extremism only on paper and in workshops . 
the country faces no present threat of religious terrorism ,  state committee for religious affairs chairman kanybek osmonaliyev said . 
the south is ablaze ,  he said . 
extremists … are not going to attack the country at such a time . 
if we are going to regret the loss of the mias ninth department ,  it will be much later . 
but another scholar disputed that view . 
there was and always will be a threat of extremism ,  said leonid bondarets ,  a regional security analyst at the kyrgyz-russian slavic university . 
so ,  follow through on what you say . 
the department handled illegal immigration ,  said aigul ryskulova ,  a former labour ,  employment and migration minister now serving as the interim governments special representative on refugee matters in the south . 
now there is no one in the special services dealing with it ,  she said . 
the times are confused ,  and this is an important issue . 
it seems to me that we have lost important rear-echelon services .

ttp insurgents dynamited two schools in pakistan's khyber district on <abbr>dec.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
 ( afp / getty images ) 
pakistan is struggling with a fierce ttp  ( taliban )  insurgency that has killed <num>72</num>  people in bombings across the country in the past three days alone . 
wazir said that militants had buried large quantities of dynamite around the outer walls of the government-run secondary school and primary school . 
 " both ttp and lashkar-e-islam people are involved in this act ,  "  he said . 
pakistani troops launched an offensive in khyber district ,  which straddles peshawar and afghanistan ,  in september to try and draw out both the ttp and home-grown militant group lashkar-e-islam  ( army of islam )  . 
he said that the death toll from the blast in the nation's cultural capital had risen from <num>49</num>  to <num>51</num>  , with about <num>140</num>  people wounded .

islamabad ,  pakistan - papa why they are searching my school bag ,  my <num>5</num> -year-old son shahzeb asked as he looked at the armed security guards using metal detectors to check each bag hanging on the backs of children entering the school . 
i know ,  papa ,  they are looking for bombs he said triumphantly after finding me speechless in response to his question . 
his answer was more shocking than the question as he was too young to be talking about bombs . 
but that is the reality in which pakistan finds itself today . 
after the launch of military operations in south waziristan and a deadly suicide attack on islamic international university islamabad ,  most educational institutions were closed because of the fear of terrorist and suicide attacks . 
at the islamic university islamabad about <num>10</num>  female students and a guard were killed and many others were injured when a suicide bomber blew up in front of a cafeteria during a lunch break . 
after a one-week break the government allowed educational institutions to reopen but issued strict written instructions to the management to take adequate security steps . 
so all educational institutions hired security guards equipped with electronic gadgets ,  installed cctv cameras and security gates at school entrances . 
this was really unthinkable that the situation would reach … such a level where minor children could be the likely targets of terrorist attacks ,  nadeem said as he watched his daughter pass through the security gates to the school . 
this searching of school children by armed men at the gates is really depressing but is unavoidable ,  says ali anwar ,  principal of city school capital campus islamabad . 
city schools is the leading chain of private schools in pakistan having campuses across the country . 
it doesnt look to be a school ,  but an inter services intelligence  ( isi )  headquarters ,  anwar said he overheard one student telling another while passing through security checks . 
anwar said the government has issued written instructions to the schools leaders to ensure extra security measures are in place . 
all schools have fenced their boundaries . 
a leading politician and secretary general of pakistan muslim league  ( pml-n )  ,  iqbal zafar jaghra ,  said he had stopped his grandchildren from going to schools . 
when children go to schools their parents are waiting anxiously for their safe return ,  he said . 
along with regular checks at school entrances ,  the children in islamabad have to pass through the heavily armed police officers standing at dozens of security check posts on city streets . 
school vans are stopped daily at security check posts on the way to school and they are searched for suspected explosives . 
islamabad police check vehicles and passersby randomly . 
police have established <num>80</num>  to <num>90</num>  additional police posts on the roads and streets ,  said hakim khan ,  a senior officer with the capital police . 
he said because of threats of terrorist attacks and suicide bombers ,  most of the check posts are on roads entering the city or leading to the red zone . 
the islamabad red zone houses the parliament house ,  embassies and other governmental buildings . 
the protection of students lives is the prime obligation ,  however ,  there is a need for counseling ,  particularly for children in early grades before exposing them to regular checks ,  taj said . 
taj said exposing young children to security ,  armed guards and bag searches without proper counseling can cause behavioral changes and can sometimes lead to sleeping disorders . 
according to taj ,  the number of psychiatric patients ,  particularly among the young ,  has increased phenomenally . 
nobody feels safe at places like schools ,  mosques ,  markets and even at homes ,  he said .

swat ,  pakistan -- mohibullah khan lost his brother and his <num>12</num> -room home last year in the fight against the taliban . 
today ,  he needs thousands of rupees just to remove the debris ;  millions more would be needed to build a new home . 
i lost my brother in the battle with taliban ,  who also dynamited our home ,  mohibullah ,  <num>53</num>  , who served in pakistans merchant navy ,  said in a choked voice while sitting in a porch beside a damaged room with cracked walls . 
now i am old and my children will take years to start earning . 
i think i will live with this wreckage for the rest of my life ,  mohibullah said in a gloomy voice . 
because mohibullah lost his home during operation rah-e-rast  ( operation right path )  ,  a governmental initiative to restore peace in the swat valley ,  he is eligible for compensation . 
it has ,  however ,  a chequered history of militancy . 
that uprising was quelled with the use of force by islamabad . 
in early <num>2007</num>  , young cleric mullah fazlullah began influencing the local population by issuing decrees through illegal fm radio stations . 
men began growing beards ,  stopped watching tv and listening to music and women donated their gold ornaments to help the cleric enforce islam at gunpoint . 
when things began getting dangerous ,  the then-provincial government called in the army to restore calm . 
however ,  the militancy staged a comeback after a peace deal between the militant and liberal islamists ,  and the secular-led coalition government in peshawar in the spring of <num>2009</num>  .
critics say the army did not do the job satisfactorily ;  the army said the deal helped the militants regroup . 
in may ,  some <num>2.7</num>  million people left their homes days before the military operation and <num>20</num>  percent of them now live in relief camps ,  giving the military free rein to use lethal force to evict militants from their district for good . 
the extent of damage to property has been immense . 
government officials believe about <num>10,000</num>  homes might have been damaged by the conflict . 
a harsh winter is making life more difficult for those living in damaged homes . 
there are many people who are living in damaged homes which can fall any time and kill many more people . 
but these affected families cannot stay at rented homes  ( due to )  poor financial conditions ,  said riaz ahmed ,  a community leader in bara bandai . 
in my union council ,  <num>90</num>  percent of families have been affected by the operation . 
in nawey kalay ,  near mingora ,  bakht karims house has been declared a criminal building by a survey team made up of civil and military personnel . 
he lost his home after the military dynamited it ,  saying the taliban used it to target the security forces . 
the damage and needs assessment  ( dna )  report by the provincial government has estimated the swat conflict inflicted some us$860 million in losses . 
that is what will be required to repair the social sectors and physical infrastructure ,  including housing ,  education and health ,  transport ,  water and sanitation ,  environment and governance . 
we hope there will be no delay in the reconstruction process and money will be made available by all stakeholders  ( federal ,  provincial governments and international community )  ,  said adnan zafar ,  head of relief and operations at the provincial disaster management authority in peshawar . 
he start of the reconstruction depends on how the international community responds . 
japan ,  for example ,  signed an agreement december <num>10</num>  with the un development programme to provide us$12 million for peace building ,  governance and economic recovery in the region . 
my deadline to start the reconstruction process is january <num>31</num>   ( <num>2010</num>  )  ,  zafar said . 
but he declined to say when the process will be completed . 
we will finish the job as quickly as we can ,  but it all depends how quickly you get money . 
terrorism in peshawar creates big business for coffin sales
coffins can be seen everywhere in the northwest frontier capital ,  peshawar ,  after an increase in terrorist attacks in the city during the war on terrorism . 
 [ abdullah jan ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- coffins ,  once considered a luxury here ,  are now more of a necessity . 
the reason :  terrorism is resulting in damaged corpses that have to be boxed before they can be buried . 
had the city administration not provided a coffin box ,  we would have bought one ,  said sajid ahmad ,  whose young cousin was killed in a bomb explosion at a crowded shopping mall in peshawar october <num>28</num>  .
it was not a one-piece body . 
we buried many pieces . 
an older suicide attack victim was buried without his face being visible to relatives and friends ,  going against tradition in most parts of pakistan . 
the deceaseds eldest son ,  majid khan ,  said ,  the body was charred ;  i couldnt leave it open for others to see . 
terrorist attacks in northwestern pakistan have proved an unfortunate blessing in disguise for coffin manufacturers and traders ,  who have made more money this year than ever before . 
it doesnt sound good ,  but my business has flourished due to more terrorist attacks during the current year ,  said jehanzeb khan ,  <num>52</num>  , who runs a coffin manufacturing factory and an outlet in old peshawar . 
besides the coffins ,  jehanzeb also sells other necessities for burial ,  including white sheets ,  known as kafan ,  used to wrap the dead body ,  body bags and flowers for the graves . 
terrorist attacks increased in peshawar and elsewhere in pakistan after pakistani security forces launched massive operations against militant groups ,  beginning in the northern swat valley may <num>5</num>  .
peshawar ,  which shares borders with the vulnerable tribal areas between pakistan and afghanistan ,  has witnessed <num>23</num>  bomb blasts and suicide attacks since may <num>2009</num>  .
more than <num>300</num>  people have died . 
a coffin used to be a rich mans commodity . 
medical officials agree on the need for coffins . 
abdul hameed of the lady reading hospital in peshawar said the hospital bought more than <num>300</num>  coffins out of its own budget during <num>2009</num>  .
the al-khidmat foundation ,  a social work agency of the religious / political party jamaat-e-islami ,  donated more than <num>100</num>  coffins to different hospitals in peshawar in october and november . 
hospitals used them to bury the unidentified and unclaimed bodies recovered from different blasts sites ,  al-khidmat regional chief iqbal khalil told central asia online . 
coffin traders seem not to care much about public concerns ,  especially when they are making money due to more deaths from bombings and activities against terrorists . 
pakistan deals with challenges of hiv / aids
mobile team of punjab aids control program at drug users hot spot to provide antiseptic dressings and harm reduction service  [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore ,  pakistan - kashif ,  a <num>25</num> -year-old pipe fitter working in dubai ,  was looking forward to meeting his wife and two young children . 
then dubai officials found out he was hiv-positive and deported him . 
back in pakistan ,  kashif said ,  i just cant brace myself to tell my wife that i have the aids virus . 
another big one is that he cant find a job . 
i still have the skills ,  but its not easy . 
people dont want to accept me  ( because they say )  extramarital sex does not happen in our society . 
the cycle is simple :  pakistanis leave the country to find work ;  the migrant workers have unprotected sex and contract hiv ;  they are then deported and return to pakistan where they unwittingly pass the virus on to their partners . 
communication would be one of the major elements to create awareness as well as facilitate behavioural change ,  said saadia naeem ,  behaviour change communication campaign coordinator at the pacp . 
but the stigma associated with hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases has been a barrier for the delivery of pacps services . 
all countries in south asia have a range of factors that increase vulnerability to hiv / aids ,  especially for women . 
according to a unaids report released august <num>18</num>  , more than <num>1.5</num>  million women living with hiv in asia have been infected by their husbands or boyfriends . 
another <num>50</num>  million are at risk of infection . 
my husband was also suffering from the same disease and passed away ,  leaving her to support the large family ,  said rubina . 
at <num>35</num>  , rubina is a mother of four who was diagnosed as hiv positive last year . 
wwhl has launched a nationwide campaign on hiv / aids awareness based on a rights-based approach to create an understanding in the community on gender equality ,  womens personal health issues ,  safe sex and enable them to create such environments where stigma and discrimination of hiv / aids positive people is no longer a submissive solution ,  she said . 
despite the stigma associated with the disease ,  health care options are available . 
recently ,  a new hiv treatment centre has been established at jinnah hospital ,  lahore ,  where free indoor medical facilities are being provided ,  he said . 
pacp also established two prevention of parent to child transmission  ( pptct )  of hiv / aids centres in lahore to prevent the transmission from infected mother to child . 
swat terror traumatizes children
children sit on the ground as they listen to a speaker at the child protection centre at upper bedara village in the matta tehsil of swat . 
the centre is one of many providing counselling to children affected by violence in the region . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
the fear started after suspected taliban militants killed her father after dragging him and his two daughters from his car in broad daylight in the matta tehsil of the swat district . 
maryam is totally a changed girl now after this barbaric act of the taliban . 
some <num>90</num>  centres ,  funded by unicef and run by the aurat foundation ,  the hayat foundation and the sustainable peace and development organization  ( spado )  ,  opened november <num>1</num>  for two months . 
their operations were extended through december <num>31</num>  , <num>2010</num>  to better serve the needs of children in the area . 
such centres exist in only <num>30</num>  local councils ;  the other <num>35</num>  local councils have not yet been declared safe . 
suicide attacks ,  bombings and public beheadings by militants - not to mention the military response - have been part of daily life in the district . 
aside from the human cost ,  the government will need to spend some us$860m to rebuild destroyed homes ,  schools ,  hospitals and damaged infrastructure . 
mustafa kamal ,  monitor of upper bedara cpc ,  said that children between the ages of <num>2</num>  and <num>18</num>  have been rehabilitated by psychologists and teachers who are trying to take taliban-created fears out of their minds . 
the conflict has traumatized people from all walks of life ,  but children were hit hard and it will take time to get these affected children back to normal life ,  mustafa said in an interview . 
if there is peace and the security forces take full control of the situation in the district ,  we hope these children will be rehabilitated and they will resume their schooling as soon as possible . 
the lack of qualified psychologists hampers the humanitarian organizations efforts to help the disturbed children . 
there are not many qualified psychologists in the districts and psychologists from other cities are reluctant to come to swat ,  said muhammad umar ,  aurat foundation cpc coordinator for the district . 
what we did was that we arranged short courses for local teachers and they are helping to rehabilitate the children . 
javed akhtar ,  coordinator for the spado-run child protection centres ,  said thousands of children were affected by the conflict . 
there are taliban and military-linked fears among the swat children and displacement by the conflict also left deep scars on their mind ,  he said . 
muhammad adnan ,  <num>13</num>  , was a brilliant student before the conflict . 
today ,  his mental health worries his parents . 
the conflict has changed him . 
he is a scared boy today . 
he locks his room from the inside  ( when )  he hears gunshots ,  fazal wahab said of his son . 
i believe rehabilitation of the affected children will take some five to seven years and these centres should continue to run as long as we have not helped all these children ,  akhtar said . 
a pakistani paramilitary soldier stands on a road during a strike january <num>1</num>  protesting the suicide bomb attack on a shiite muslim religious procession in karachi . 
the december <num>28</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , bombing of the religious procession killed more than <num>45</num>  people ,  raising fears that karachi is once again in militants sights . 
 [ rizwan tabassum / afp / getty images ] 
after a week of strikes to protest and mourn the bombing that killed more than <num>45</num>  people december <num>28</num>  , things are getting back to normal as reconstruction of the burned boulton market shops picks up pace . 
but like any other city ,  diverse criminal elements -- terrorists ,  their affiliates and the citys criminal underworld -- fight for control ,  and that has the city on edge . 
the city is no stranger to terrorism . 
in the past ,  numerous high-profile terror attacks targeted karachi . 
a deadly attack on a french naval engineers bus ,  suicide attacks on the us consulate ,  and the murder of journalist daniel pearl ,  all earned karachi the title of terrorism capital of pakistan before the terror campaign shifted upcountry . 
while karachi police have periodically arrested militants ,  the ashura attack proves once again the failure of intelligence and the law enforcement agencies in anticipating a terrorist attack and preventing its fallout . 
part of this is bad coordination between the intelligence and several of the law enforcement agencies ,  their motivation and training ,  a security analyst said . 
the industrial-based economy of karachi draws people from all over the country because of its opportunities . 
not only has karachi become a haven for those with militant leanings ,  it also generates lots of funding for the ongoing terrorism in tribal areas ,  as well as in afghanistan ,  farooq said . 
as in the past ,   ( the funds from )  many major bank heists have ended up in hands of terrorist networks fighting the government in tribal areas . 
the investigations remain another problem area . 
in the immediate aftermath of the december <num>28</num>  violence ,  interior minister rehman malik in islamabad ,  and the inspector general  ( ig )  of sindh ,  salahuddin babar khattak in karachi ,  initially termed it a suicide attack . 
preliminary losses are estimated at about <num>35</num>  billion rupees  ( us$412 million )  and more than <num>10,000</num>  people have lost their jobs . 
the attack affected trading in other wholesale markets as the boulton market supplies plastic-ware to the entire country . 
many exporters also operate from this market . 
according to pakistan muslim league leader mushahid hussain ,  the area contributes as much as <num>25</num>  percent of all taxes collected in the country . 
mushahid visited the <num>400</num> -odd shops and warehouses that were damaged or destroyed in the fire ,  which raged for nearly three days . 
the police acted without any contingency planning ,  said a senior police source . 
they did not even protect the fire engines ,  open aerial firing or even fire tear gas shells to disperse the mob .

 [ aamir qureshi / afp / getty images ] 
islamabad ,  pakistan -- terrorist attacks saw a dramatic increase in <num>2009</num>  , causing huge human and economic losses to a country fighting against insurgents in both tribal and settled areas . 
but ,  despite the governments continued efforts against militants and insurgents in parts of the country ,  security analysts are not optimistic about improvement in the security situation in <num>2010</num>  .
pakistan security forces are engaged against militants in the countrys tribal belt after clearing the swat valley of insurgents . 
terrorists are adopting new strategies ,  but the government is conducting fire-fights with no clear objectives or national policy to handle the threat effectively . 
insurgency and terrorism may be linked ,  but countering terrorism needs an effective policing system and coordination between the country premier intelligence agencies . 
insurgency can be suppressed by use of force or through military operations ,  as was done in the swat and malakand divisions . 
but ,  rana added ,  unfortunately ,  presently there is no cooperation between pakistan intelligence agencies and police . 
a long-term political strategy for tackling terrorism and insurgency is lacking in pakistan . 
instead ,  the country is using short-term ,  half-hearted policies with no clear objectives . 
many times police have arrested important terrorists ,  but in the absence of proper laws ,  they  ( terrorists )  get released in court ,  rana said . 
anti-terrorism courts established in <num>1997</num>  have ,  so far ,  decided only six cases of terrorism ;  of those ,  two have been punished and the rest are in appeals courts . 
unlike the past ,  abbas said ,  now there are small pockets of militants in bajaur and mohmand tribal agencies ,  which will be soon be cleared . 
khalid aziz ,  former chief secretary of the nwfp and now a security and development consultant ,  told central asian online that a strong government is key to maintaining peace in the areas that have had problems with militants . 
without a strong civil administration ,  he said ,  the military will come under pressure and the media will demand peace deals with the militants . 
hussain said pakistan has to adopt a different strategy to deal with militancy and terrorism . 
though military operations in pakistan have stabilized swat and might get some successes in tribal areas ,  terrorism will remain a problem to deal with ,  hussian said . 
karachi stock exchange capital surges by us <num>1.2</num>  $  billion in five days
karachi ,  pakistan -- a perfect storm of financial events has pushed the capital of karachi stock exchange  ( kse )  up by us <num>1.2</num>  $  billion in five trading days in <num>2010</num>  .
on december <num>31</num>  , the capital of the kse was us <num>32.2</num>  $  billion ;  it surged to us <num>33.4</num>  $  billion in five trading sessions in january . 
the kse-100 benchmark rose to <num>9,771</num>  points by january <num>12</num>  , from <num>9,386</num>  points on december <num>31</num>  .
the stock markets first trading day of <num>2010</num>  was january <num>4</num>  .
the market was closed january <num>1</num>  to support a nationwide strike after the december <num>28</num>  bombing and torching of markets in karachi . 
after <num>18</num>  months ,  the kse index has again reached very close to <num>10,000</num>  points in the wake of different positive economic developments ,  ahmed nabil ,  coo of the javed omer vohra company  ( jovc )  told central asia online . 
oil prices ,  an infusion of money from the international monetary fund  ( imf )  and increased interest by foreign investors are pushing the jump in capital . 
nabil said that despite frequent bombings in pakistan ,  foreigners have invested us <num>280</num>  $  m in the past few months . 
the aggressive buying by foreigners indicates a positive outlook for growth and motivates local institutions and investors to actively trade ,  nabil added . 
international crude oil prices have increased to more than us <num>80</num>  $  a barrel and this has not only stabilized world stock markets ,  but has also encouraged fresh investment ,  especially in petroleum companies ,  nabil said . 
pakistans foreign exchange reserves have risen above us <num>15</num>  $  billion in the first week of january ,  a good sign for the economic recovery and stock market growth ,  he said . 
despite problems like terrorism and shortages of electricity ,  gas and water ,  investment has continued to flow into the stock market ,  he said . 
petroleum ,  fertilizer companies and major banks shares have performed well in the stock market in the past few weeks ,  saad bin naseer ,  an analyst and ceo of pearl capital management told central asia online . 
we are optimistic that by march <num>2010</num>  , the benchmark index will stay well over <num>10,000</num>  points . 
major companies being traded on the kse are expected to announce sound financial results and dividends that will improve the value of their shares further ,  he said . 
in <num>2010</num>  the disbursement of economic aid by the friends of democratic pakistan  ( fodp )  - a foreign investment group formed in <num>2008</num>  - could positively affect the economy ,  he said . 
more than us <num>13</num>  $  billion has been pledged to pakistan over the next five years . 
if terrorism ,  the national reconciliation ordinance  ( nro )  and other issues are tackled effectively ,  the stock market could show marvelous growth in <num>2010</num>  , naseer added . 
in <num>2008</num>  foreign investors pulled millions of dollars from the kse because of the global financial crisis ,  he said . 
however ,  as the world economy marches toward recovery ,  foreign investors are again turning to pakistan ,  he added . 
on april <num>20</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , the kse hit a record <num>15,773</num>  points amid the strong economic growth that took place under former president pervez musharraf . 
at that time ,  the market capital of the kse ballooned to more than us <num>76</num>  $  billion . 
the political crisis reached a critical point when it - coincided with the global economic meltdown in august <num>2008</num>  - that wiped out about us <num>37</num>  $  billion worth of kse capital and pushed the index down to around <num>9,000</num>  points . 
to pre-empt further market erosion and to save brokers and major investors from default ,  kse management capped the index at <num>9,000</num>  points on august <num>28</num>  , <num>2008</num>  .
on dec <num>15</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , kse regulators removed the cap and the index fell to less than <num>7,000</num>  points . 
it finally moved toward recovery starting in march <num>2009</num>  when the government announced a bail-out package for the brokers and investors who were facing default . 
stock market analysts are of the opinion that the market could again fall if the present government were removed in an undemocratic manner . 
international help needed to close cultural rifts
pashtun nationalist leader ,  khan lala ,  <num>83</num>  , discusses the challenges to heal the rift in the pashtun belt . 
 [ hasan khan ] 
dureshkhela  ( swat )  ,  pakistan -- the root cause of unrest in the pashtun belt is the division of this nation into four parts ,  and the international community must help pashtuns stitch these pieces together to bring peace to the region ,  said muhammad afzal khan ,  alias khan lala . 
i am not talking of drawing new boundaries ,  but of watering down the existing one  ( the durand line )  on the pattern of europe to bring pashtuns in pakistan and afghanistan together ,  khan lala said when asked how pashtuns could unite . 
otherwise ,  he warned ,  the youth will become disillusioned and might fall back in with bad elements . 
although peace has been restored in the valley ,  khan lala said reconstruction has been slow . 
it is a tough task and the government needs to start it immediately and get the people involved in economic activities ,  he added . 
north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  chief minister  ( cm )  haider khan hotis press office told central asia online the government has pumped billions of rupees into rebuilding the region . 
the government completed a damage assessment survey of the swat and malakand areas and <num>17</num>  billion rupees have been released for reconstruction . 
billions more will be spent and the international community has pledged aid ,  the cms press office said . 
however ,  khan lala believes that besides the physical infrastructure ,  the government also needs to focus on the mental and psychological rehabilitation of the traumatized community . 
according to khan lala ,  the foremost responsibility of the government is to establish an efficient judicial and administrative system . 
he said an administrative vacuum was a root cause of the insurgency . 
khan lala said it would be disastrous for pakistan and the region if militants make a comeback in the valley . 
the cms press office said extensive steps have been taken to protect against the re-emergence of militancy . 
besides doubling the regular police force ,  about <num>7,000</num>  community officers and <num>25,000</num>  retired military personnel have been augmented to the malakand security team . 
khan lala believes the seeds of unrest were planted in <num>1969</num>  , when swat merged with pakistan . 
the government introduced provincially administered tribal area - pata - regulations . 
the administrative vacuum helped sufi muhammads tehrik nifaz shariat muhammadi  ( tnsm )  launch from the dir district ,  said khan lala . 
sufis son-in-law ,  mullah fazllullah took over the movement in <num>2002</num>  , when sufi was sent to jail . 
government efforts to check mullah fazllullah and his followers were half-hearted and allowed the militancy to strengthen ,  khan lala said . 
two early military operations failed because the military did not act aggressively ,  he said . 
the military entered the valley in november ,  <num>2007</num>  , but the army remained in their barracks as differences erupted between the religious coalition partners jamat-e-islami  ( ji )  and jamiat-ul-ulema islam  ( jui )  ,  said khan lala . 
it was a big mistake ,  as in the presence of military ,  militants were brutally killing people loyal to government or army ,  he said . 
this added to the impression that military and militants are two sides of the same coin and people lost confidence in the government ,  khan lala said . 
when the military successfully pushed militants outside population centers ,  the new awami national party  ( anp )  government in the nwfp struck an agreement in february <num>2008</num>  .
the valley was handed over to mullah fazllullah ,  said khan lala ,  considered an important leader of anp . 
the agreement lasted just three months ,  and during this period ,  militants eliminated those supporting the military operation . 
in may <num>2009</num>  , the military started a decisive battle against the militants . 
by july <num>2009</num>  , the military had restored peace in the malakand division . 
khan lala ,  an influential khan of the valley ,  disagrees with suggestions that this was class war . 
in class war ,  nobody kills poor daily wagers ,  or bombs schools and poor peoples homes ,  khan lala said . 
militants have neither a program nor ideology . 
they are creating anarchy in the name of islam ,  he added . 
about economic loss ,  khan lala said ,  the valleys system has been crippled . 
the  ( economic )  loss is in billions of rupees and irreparable in decades ,  he said . 
factories were closed . 
thousands of workers lost their jobs . 
tourism ended and hotels have shut down ,  he said . 
about his role in the future ,  khan lala said he had already assembled once all the influential people from swat in islamabad in june <num>2009</num>  when he went there for medical treatment . 
i told the jirga then that problems of swat can only be solved in swat ,  not in peshawar or islamabad ,  said khan lala . 
now ,  he said ,  he wants to assemble them again at a neutral place .

 [ arif ali / afp / getty images ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- military and political analysts say pakistan is moving into the most critical stage of its war against militancy ,  and hope that <num>2010</num>  will herald a complete victory with correct focus and right direction after successes amid the death and destruction of <num>2009</num>  .
several analysts said that <num>2010</num>  will be a decisive year in terms of the war against militants in the tribal areas along the border with afghanistan and the north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  . 
the federal interior ministry in islamabad said <num>1,217</num>  people were killed in <num>80</num>  suicide attacks and bombings in <num>2009</num>  .
that average of <num>101</num>  deaths every month was up from <num>80</num>  a month in <num>2008</num>  .
civilian casualties stood at <num>863</num>  .
also ,  <num>137</num>  police officers ,  <num>102</num>  soldiers ,  <num>51</num>  paramilitary frontier constabulary personnel ,  <num>28</num>  inter-services intelligence members and <num>12</num>  pakistan rangers died . 
i am pretty sure pakistan will regain control of areas it lost to taliban in tribal and other settled areas ,  he told central asia online . 
his certainty is based on reported successes in swat and south waziristan during the ongoing military offensives launched last year that almost dismantled the command and control structure of the outlawed tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  and its affiliated swat taliban ,  and regained control of the two important areas . 
swat valley is <num>90</num>  percent government-controlled now and military operations in south waziristan pushed thousands of militants deep into the bordering north waziristan ,  kurram and orakzai tribal areas . 
hailed as a big achievement was the death of the ttp chief ,  baitullah mehsud ,  in a missile attack august <num>5</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
another attack took out senior jihadi commander haji umar ,  who was leading attacks on forces in afghanistan . 
but the country faces serious challenges in <num>2010</num>  that should not be underestimated ,  according to afrasiab khattak ,  peace envoy for the nwfp government in peshawar and former chairman of the human rights commission of pakistan  ( hrcp )  . 
the terrorists are again and again regrouping . 
the ttp creates another space after losing one . 
they are targeting urban and population and financial centres ,  he said . 
he recognizes the importance of political initiative alongside the military offensive . 
a transition from military to civilian control in swat and other tribal areas will be important ,  too . 
security and development expert khalid aziz gives four months to accomplish this goal . 
if we do not hand over control to a reformed and a revamped civilian administration in swat and south waziristan ,  the military will come under pressure and its supply line will be threatened with the media demanding peace with militants ,  khalid aziz ,  former chief secretary of the nwfp told central asian online . 
the political compact will be threatened . 
the nwfp will become poorer and the writ of the state will be weakened . 
now is the time - the next four months - in which to win our war and hand over to a well managed civilian administration in swat and waziristan . 
interviews with people affected by the militancy in swat and the tribal areas indicate that the militant groups have lost considerable public support after the brutal terror they spread . 
they hurt our sentiments about religion . 
political bickering in islamabad is affecting the war against terrorism and is encouraging all non-state actors to settle the issue with bullets ,  not with ballots ,  political commentator fazal-ur-rahim marwat said . 
unflinching public support and political ownership of military offensives and quick transition from army to civilian control of previously taliban-held areas will be the key in the war against the militancy ,  the analysts said .

blood bags lie on a table in a local laboratory on jinnah road ,  quetta . 
blood related diseases are on the rise in balochistan because of the unscreened blood trade . 
 [ ghani kakar ] 
quetta ,  pakistan - the blood pumping through balochistans blood banks might be doing more harm than good . 
residents of quetta and other cities of balochistan risk health problems as many private blood banks and pathology laboratories are being run without qualified pathologists and mandatory licenses from the provincial health department of balochistan . 
habib nulla ,  for example ,  is a populated area where drug addicts hang out . 
the addicts draw blood from themselves with used syringes . 
after collecting the blood ,  the addict sells it to the blood bank ,  which fails to test the blood . 
its a supply-and-demand cycle . 
sick people need the blood ;  the blood banks need people to provide them with blood ;  the drug addicts need the money blood banks pay for blood . 
mohammad khan ,  <num>40</num>  , a drug addict ,  relies on selling blood to pay for his habit . 
the provincial government has established two committees to regulate the system and to effectively implement the safe blood transfusion authority he said . 
according to the record ,  there are only <num>32</num>  qualified pathologists in balochistan who are legally authorized to properly run pathology labs by the rules . 
when asked why the government is not taking proper action against those who are running illegal blood banks and labs ,  qamar replied ,  in action against some labs ,  <num>14</num>  illegal pathology labs were sealed in quetta during the last couple of months while cases were also filed in courts against eight people who are being investigated . 
governmental and nongovernmental organizations  ( ngos )  are spending millions of rupees to stop the illegal blood transfusion business and make the people aware of it ,  but due to lack of management and improper monitoring ,  its objectives have not been reached . 
the federal government has moved toward establishing a federal blood transfusion authority . 
cases of hiv / aids ,  hepatitis b or c ,  malarial parasites ,  diabetes and other diseases are increasing all over balochistan due to the illegal practice of unscreened blood transfusion ,  he said . 
lack of awareness of the problem has contributed to the number of cases of hiv-infected people surpassing <num>160</num>  in balochistan ,  he said . 
pakistani film industry struggles to survive
a billboard in lahore advertises a pakistani film . 
the government has pledged to help the flagging film industry by waiving a <num>65</num>  percent excise tax and helping to build a production facility ,  but the aid has yet to be realised . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore ,  pakistan - kashif ,  a student ,  came out of a posh theatre after watching a bollywood movie and said lollywood produces no more quality films . 
viewers of domestic  ( lollywood )  films dont get the pleasure of a good story line to enjoy with popcorn ,  he said . 
most of the time i go for vcds or dvds of bollywood and hollywood movies at homes . 
now ,  pakistani filmmaking has all but vanished . 
the industry that emerged in the <num>1960</num>  second  and <num>1970</num>  second  as distinct from bollywood  ( indias film capital )  is now barely breathing . 
many cinemas are closed ,  and the rest pay heavy taxes . 
many cinemas are used for commercial functions . 
because of government laxity and rampant film piracy ,  over the past two decades the standards of the film industry have deteriorated and technical facilities have closed . 
only <num>120</num>  out of <num>1,000</num>  cinemas across the country are open today . 
she lamented that the industry needs the latest equipment and new studios ,  and producers arent investing since the equipment is obsolete . 
and she demanded a ban on indian films . 
according to sangeeta ,  showing them hurts the local industry since the foreign films are shown at the best cinemas . 
now the investors are interested in buying indian films for release here ,  she said . 
during <num>2009</num>  , only three movies were released . 
they flopped at the box office . 
such movies are the main reason for the falling number of cinemas nationwide ,  said safdar ,  a cinema owner . 
he lamented that most visible directors ,  producers and cinema owners need second jobs to make ends meet . 
few films are in the pipeline . 
private production studios have started making tv plays . 
but syed noor has established a film school to assist the coming generation of filmmakers in lahore . 
the importation of indian movies was needed … to keep the identity of cinema houses alive ,  safdar said . 
hashim ali titu ,  in charge of production at bari studio ,  said an unprofessional attitude by actors pushed lollywoods creative talent out of the industry . 
scripts got worse ,  and pakistanis stopped watching local movies . 
titu cited other challenges :  cheap or free access to films on cable channels ,  rising production costs ,  a tide of foreign films ,  higher costs for chemicals and raw materials ,  and devaluation of the rupee . 
the pakistani film industry ,  which was already on its deathbed ,  suffered another heavy blow when the punjab excise and taxation department initially imposed a <num>65</num>  percent entertainment tax on it in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  .
the amount of the total entertainment tax paid by the entire cinema industry in punjab is only around us$301 , 531 which is peanuts for the punjab government ,  said amjad farzand ali ,  chairman of the film industry action committee . 
it easily do without it if the chief minister expressed that interest . 
somebody in the government heard the industrys cry for help . 
filmmakers recently received support from the government ,  including the establishment of a production house . 
it is also said that the punjab chief minister  ( cm )  has agreed to waive the <num>65</num>  percent excise tax on cinemas in principle . 
the punjab government is all set to offer maximum possible assistance and to resolve the pakistani film industrys problems amicably ,  said khawaja imran nazir ,  media coordinator to the cm ,  punjab . 
but jahanzaib baig ,  chairman of the pakistan film exhibitors association  ( pfea )  ,  alleged that the ministers committee has expressed a negative attitude toward those in the industry . 
as the film industry has been pushed to the brink of collapse ,  the senate standing committee on culture appointed a committee to aid its revival . 
the senate group also discussed ways to elevate the industry's flagging quality ,  issues of law enforcement ,  film censorship ,  and piracy ,  including cable and video-related subjects . 
the committee urged the government to provide incentives for private film production groups to make quality low-budget films on social issues . 
new military offensives against militants unlikely this year
islamabad ,  pakistan -- growing tensions with india ,  the conflict in afghanistan and the countrys limited resources have contributed to the militarys decision not to launch new military operations against militants for six months to a year ,  officials and analysts say . 
however ,  zafar abbas ,  resident editor of the daily newspaper dawn ,  said he believes rising tensions with india and the situation in afghanistan influenced the militarys decision to consolidate gains in areas purged of militants instead of over-stretching troops in new operations against militants . 
but ,  he said the military has conducted operations at suspected miltants hideouts in the orakzai and kurram tribal agencies . 
but north  ( waziristan )  is in the control of the government with the presence of one division of the military ,  he said . 
he added that when hafiz gul bahadur  ( a militant commander in north waziristan )  killed <num>40</num>  troops ,  the military killed more than <num>70</num>  militants in retaliation . 
there is a strong feeling that increasing hostilities with india is a backgrounder for this decision and leadership will never close its eyes on it which is matter of national security ,  zafar abbas said . 
moreover ,  the situation in afghanistan may be another reason for the military not to open new fronts ,  he said . 
once fully secured and stabilized ,  zafar said ,  the government could easily tackle the retreating taliban crossing heading to afghanistan from tribal areas . 
he added that pakistans military leaders are also looking for political support before committing soldiers and incurring more casualties . 
it will embolden the militants who will feel pakistan military is tired and cant continue action against them ,  he said . 
zafar said that except for north waziristan ,  the military has mostly cleared the important areas where militants were in control of the situation . 
in the north ,  instead of operating through ground troops ,  the government might be interested in elimination of militants leadership through air attacks which has already increased in frequency during the last few weeks ,  zafar said . 
amir called the military decision pragmatic and realistic . 
the military hasnt yet finished its job in malakand ,  waziristan and other areas ,  amir said . 
unless it has not finished its old job ,  it would not be good for military to open new fronts . 
the sale of ready-made graves has emerged as a new business in balochistan because of a shortage of jobs and free graves . 
 [ ghani kakar ] 
quetta ,  pakistan - when habibullah goes to a bazaar ,  hes not buying - hes selling a new product :  pre-dug graves . 
daily ,  i spend most of my time …  ( trying )  to sell graves and to convince those people who have a dead body … to buy a grave from us ,  habibullah said . 
the idea of buying gravesites is nothing new in most countries ,  but in pakistan ,  where graves used to be free and were dug by the families of the deceased ,  its a new trade . 
a desire to earn a living in an underdeveloped region with few job opportunities is one reason behind the emergence of this new business . 
the other is a shortage of free gravesites . 
habibullah said he sought other work for a long time before becoming a gravedigger . 
amanullah ,  <num>55</num>  , who owns a local graveyard and sells plots there ,  told central asia online that gravediggers fall into one of two categories :  those who dig graves and get paid daily by the landowner ,  or those who have already dug graves in various graveyards they own and are now trying to sell the sites . 
some graves are plain holes in the ground ,  while others are covered with concrete . 
mud-based graves are cheap . 
in quetta ,  as the population has increased ,  the cost of the graves has gone up . 
but that inflation doesnt translate into higher pay for the gravediggers . 
the cost is high in part because the purchase price in quetta includes a form of protection . 
the so-called land mafia would otherwise put buildings on top of graveyards ,  taking away the ability of the survivors to pray at the graves of their loved ones . 
graveyard owners who sell gravesites can afford to pay guards to protect their land . 
because grave-selling is a new trade in quetta ,  officials havent imposed any restrictions yet . 
they see the industry as a source of jobs and as a solution to the general lack of burial space throughout the area . 
being a citizen of balochistan ,  i am very aware of the whole situation in the province ,  he said . 
in balochistan ,  the local people have been denied their basic rights for decades ,  especially by our political leaders ,  said rozi kahn ,  a former administrator of the zarghoon town in quetta . 
peace lashkars move against militants
lashkar leader dilawar khan  ( 4th from right )  holds a kalashnikov aloft after a group of adezai village volunteers return from an anti-taliban patrol through the suburbs of peshawar . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan - its a dangerous job ,  but villagers in peshawar have taken on the taliban . 
a group of armed villagers in a jeep patrol a dusty road to guard the southern periphery of peshawar against attacks by taliban militants . 
we are holding back the militants who want to make the law-and-order situation in the frontier metropolis collapse ,  dilawar khan ,  leader of the adezai lashkar ,  told central asia online . 
the lashkars have persevered even after losing lashkar chief abdul malik ,  who was killed last november by a suicide bomber . 
ethnic pushtuns traditionally raise lashkars ,  a group of armed villagers ,  or form unarmed amn  ( peace )  committees when they face a common enemy . 
they hope by banding together to deal with the enemy more effectively . 
such methods work as long as the government supplies weapons ,  vehicles and funds and provides armed backup . 
were doing all this on our own ,  dilawar said . 
well-off villagers help pay for the cost of running patrols and feeding over <num>150</num>  volunteers daily . 
the patrols are meant to thwart militants from southern darra adam khel or western khyber trying to reach peshawar . 
but so far ,  the provincial government isnt helping his lashkar ,  dilawar said . 
the government should fulfil the promises it made . 
zahid khan ,  the chief spokesman of the ruling awami national party in the north-west frontier province ,  said his party does believe that these lashkars or amn committees must be supported as they are contributing to building peace in their areas . 
khan told central asia online :  i dont think the  [ provincial ]  government grasps these problems or realises it has to do something about them . 
in the past the provincial and federal governments have acknowledged the importance of lashkars in fending off militants in the suburbs surrounding peshawar ,  lakki marwat ,  mardan and charsadda and in the tribal regions of bajaur ,  mohmand and orakzai . 
but lashkars say governmental promises of help are unfulfilled more often than not . 
their ability to keep foiling militants designs on major cities is attracting attention . 
theyve kept at it even after taking heavy losses . 
the list of dead keeps growing : 
 *  a suicide bombing october <num>10</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , killed <num>136</num>  orakzai regional tribal elders who had gathered near khadezai
 *  a suicide bombing march <num>2</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , killed <num>43</num>  tribal elders of the town of darra adam khel ,  <num>38</num>  kilometer  south of peshawar . 
they had gathered to discuss taking a unified approach against the militants . 
 *  alleged taliban insurgents have killed more than <num>136</num>  lashkar members since the spring of <num>2008</num>  in the mohmand tribal district . 
 *  insurgents also have killed more than <num>300</num>  elders in north and south waziristan since <num>2005</num>  , impeding the formation of a strong lashkar . 
the victims had been considered pro-government . 
residents of shah hasankhel ,  a <num>500</num> -family village in the impoverished lakki marwat district along the indus highway ,  raised a lashkar august <num>1</num>  following a military operation against the militants . 
these sacrifices will continue <abbr>…</abbr>  as long as we have to guard the peace ,  he said . 
but he lamented a lack of government support for the mission the villagers have taken on themselves . 
were paying for fuel out of our own pockets ,  he said . 
who says theres been any support <abbr>…</abbr>  from the government ? 
hakeemullah mehsud ,  chief of tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  ,  talks with media representatives at an undisclosed location in south waziristan in may <num>2008</num>  .
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan - a day after pakistani television reported the death of hakeemullah mehsud ,  intelligence officials are still seeking hard evidence that the leader of the tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  is dead . 
as of february <num>1</num>  , however ,  the taliban had not produced any evidence rebutting reports that hakeemullah recently died of wounds he sustained in a january <num>14</num>  attack . 
generally ,  the taliban confirms the death of its leaders ,  though that news sometimes comes late . 
intelligence officials said they were <num>80</num>  percent sure that the ttp chief died after being brought to the orakzai tribal region where the militants believed he could receive better medical treatment for his wounds because of the proximity to the hangu and kohat districts . 
hakeemullah took over the ttp from baitullah mehsud ,  who died in a missile attack august <num>5</num>  in south waziristan . 
it had been speculated earlier that hakeemullah was wounded january <num>14</num>  in the shaktoe region of south waziristan . 
sources close to the ttp confirmed to central asia online that hakeemullah was wounded in that attack . 
the central ttp spokesman ,  azam tariq ,  also conceded that the <num>31</num> -year-old ttp chief was in shaktoe during the strike ,  but said hakeemullah survived the attack . 
the volume of missile attacks has increased in pakistans waziristan tribal belt after a jordanian double agent blew himself up at the chaplan forward operating base in afghanistans khost province december <num>30</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
military sources told central asia online that details were being collected in an effort to find hard evidence that the ttp chief died . 
in a press statement from north waziristan january <num>31</num>  , ttp spokesman tariq said ,  this type of propaganda against hakeemullah mehsud has been unleashed by secret agencies of the government previously ,  and every time it has been proved wrong and this time ,  it will be the same . 
pakistan television quoted unnamed sources who said a doctor from hangu  ( close to the orakzai tribal region )  was kidnapped to help treat hakeemullahs wounds . 
the television report said a tribal elder attended hakeemullahs funeral in the mamuzai area of the orakzai tribal district january <num>28</num>  .
tariq called newspaper and tv station offices in peshawar sunday to deny the report of hakeemullahs death . 
the death of baitullah was confirmed only after weeks of speculation when the taliban themselves announced their leaders death . 
hakeemullah confirmed baitullahs death august <num>5</num>  - <num>20</num>  days after the missile attack that targeted him at his father-in-laws residence in south waziristan . 
tribal sources say waliur rehman mehsud ,  ttp waziristans chapter chief ,  and qari hussain mehsud ,  a mentor of suicide bombers ,  could emerge as candidates to replace hakeemullah if ,  indeed ,  he has died . 
winter gas shortage hurts consumers ,  business
pakistani motorists line up for compressed natural gas . 
shortages of the gas are affecting all sectors of the economy . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
rawalpindi ,  pakistan - when the price of compressed natural gas  ( cng )  goes up ,  a ripple effect is felt . 
people try to find alternatives for cooking and heating to offset the higher prices ,  but the hardship tends to hit everyone - even rickshaw drivers . 
the government is not thinking about the plight of a common man . 
every winter ,  especially in punjab ,  pakistan experiences a shortage of cng as colder temperatures increase demand ,  outstripping production and distribution . 
inefficient appliances that use up to <num>50</num>  percent more gas add to the problem . 
the shortage of cng leads to a shortage of petrol as consumers turn to other fuels . 
the government announcement of a gas load management plan  ( glmp )  has escalated the problem . 
under the plan ,  cng stations in the zones served by sui northern will be closed for eight days a month on a rotating basis . 
another plan has suspended gas to cng stations from 8am to 8pm in urban areas of punjab and north west frontier province . 
the federal minister for petroleum and natural resources and the managing director of sui northern in november said there would be no load shedding for domestic consumers during the winter . 
but many domestic gas consumers in lahore are without gas for <num>12</num>  to <num>14</num>  hours a day and are forced to use expensive alternatives -- electricity ,  wood ,  liquid petroleum gas or kerosene -- to meet their daily energy needs . 
sui northern also has activated a gas curtailment schedule for textile mills from november <num>1</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , to march <num>31</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
anees ul haq ,  secretary all pakistan textile mills association ,  punjab region ,  ascribed the gas and electricity load shedding to lack of planning ,  irresponsibility and inefficiency of the management and administration of the utility service suppliers . 
continuous gas supply to the textile industry is of vital importance at this time when industry is poised to recover and meet export orders ,  haq said . 
instead ,  haq proposes that gas to fertilizer plants be cut off ,  which would allow <num>70</num>  percent of the textile industry to resume operation . 
shortages of fertilizer could be made up through imports during this period and the government should compensate the fertilizer industry accordingly . 
finally ,  said haq ,  the gas supply to cng stations during winter should be disconnected . 
while many blame the glmp for their problems ,  the fact is there is only so much gas transmission capacity . 
projects like the iran-pakistan gas pipeline need to be materialized quickly in order to overcome the gas woes ,  lone said . 
it will be completed within <num>4</num>  years . 
a team of pakistani experts is engaged in talks with iranian authorities in tehran to give final shape to this project . 
pakistani businessmen want trade liberalisation with india
pakistans textile business has had to rely on distant countries for machinery and spare parts . 
the industry wants trade with india liberalized so they can save money and time . 
 [ javed mahmood ] 
karachi ,  pakistan - time - and distance - is money . 
tired of paying more for equipment ,  parts and supplies to arrive from far away ,  pakistani businessmen are seeking trade liberalisation with india . 
the textile industry wants to import machinery and spare parts from a neighbouring country that is famous for producing superior-quality machinery ,  akbar sheikh ,  former chairman of the all-pakistan textile mills association ,  punjab ,  told central asia online . 
the pakistani government had promised us to allow the import of these items from india from july <num>2009</num>  , but it did not happen till january <num>2010</num>  .
at present ,  the textile industry is importing machinery and spare parts from china ,  germany and elsewhere at higher prices and is paying more for freight ,  he said . 
shipping takes about two months ,  whereas importing from india would take two to three weeks ,  sheikh said . 
indian textile machinery and spare parts are much cheaper than chinese and german ,  but we cannot take advantage of this reduction in cost ,  since the government has yet to allow imports from  ( this )  neighbouring country ,  sheikh added . 
in the past four years ,  pakistans textile industry spent more than <num>4.5</num>  $  billion on importing machinery and spare parts . 
if the government allows imports from india ,  the industry could save up to <num>20</num>  percent ,  he said . 
trade liberalisation with india would end dependence on indirect trade through dubai and would benefit the businessmen and people of the two countries ,  abdul majid ,  president of the karachi chamber of commerce and industry ,  who has been trading with india for years ,  told central asia online . 
pakistan allows the import of <num>773</num>  items from india . 
other goods have to be imported through dubai . 
direct import by sea from india costs us$7 to <num>8</num>  $  per tonne ,  versus us$18- to <num>20</num>  $ -per-tonne cost from dubai . 
he said pakistan and india trade more than us$1 billion worth of goods through dubai yearly . 
trade between pakistan and india ,  which suffered a blow after the mumbai terrorist attacks in november <num>2008</num>  , gradually improved in <num>2009</num>  as the two countries strengthened their diplomatic and political ties ,  he said . 
currently ,  the countries trade about us$1 . 5 billion worth of goods a year . 
they could be trading about us$5 billion annually ,  he said . 
khan said that in <num>2004</num>  pakistan liberalised trade by expanding the list of importable categories from <num>400</num>  to <num>773</num>  , but that the policy has remained unchanged since . 
india and pakistan are among the biggest consumer markets in the world ,  and open trade  ( would )  benefit the people of both countries ,  majid said . 
the saarc  ( south asian association for regional co-operation )  chamber of commerce and industry has urged pakistan and india to hold a dialogue to promote their trade and to defuse tension ,  said iqbal tabish ,  secretary-general of the saarc chamber . 
the chamber is also motivating the businessmen of the two countries to promote trade . 
in <num>2009</num> -<num>09</num>  overall bilateral trade decreased by <num>16.9</num>  percent largely because of the global slowdown and the damage the mumbai attacks caused to bilateral relations ,  he said . 
among the hindrances to increased trade ,  is the cross-border terrorism from pakistan that is adversely affecting overall indian-pakistani relations ,  including trade . 
bilateral trade cannot reach its potential in an environment of terror ,  chhabra said . 
chhabra also said the free ,  unfettered movement of goods ,  such as that sought by afghanistan for its products to the large indian market through pakistans territory ,  will go a long way to promote trade within saarc . 
technical education deters tribal youth from militancy
khyber agency - farhanullah ,  <num>18</num>  , from the bajaur tribal region ,  was upbeat when he received his certificate after completing a four-month training course in plumbing from a peshawar technical training centre . 
the taliban had destroyed his school and intimidated him and his friends into abandoning their education ,  farhanullah said . 
with nothing else to do ,  some of his friends joined militant organisations because they saw no other option . 
muhammad nasir ,  secretary of the federally administered tribal areas development authority  ( fda )  ,  said ,  when the insurgency broke out ,  these youth proved to be most vulnerable to the tide of the times by serving as cannon fodder in the ongoing conflict . 
much damage already seems to have been done ,  and turning the tide looks <abbr>…</abbr>  difficult . 
he said that ,  previously ,  drives through the tribal areas would reveal hordes of tribal youth squatting idly by the roadsides and staring vacantly at the passing vehicles . 
it is generally accepted by authorities that the spread of militancy in the fata can be attributed to the lack of education and job skills among the tribal youth . 
to give tribal youth job skills and a sense of hope ,  the fata rural development project has organized training for unemployed youth of the khyber ,  mohmand and bajaur tribal regions . 
nisar wazir ,  a tribal political activist from south waziristan ,  said that :  a good number of tribal youth were either volunteered by their parents for suicide attacks or were kidnapped by the taliban <abbr>…</abbr>  for such purposes . 
the programme envisions enabling the tribal youth to become responsible members of mainstream pakistani society . 
the latter was designed to give the youth on-the-job training in order to expose them to experience as well as to let the potential employers assess their skill and performance ,  said nasir . 
that tribal youth were targeted by militants for recruitment is not in doubt . 
ahmad afridi ,  <num>19</num>  , who completed a television and radio repair course ,  expressed optimism that such training courses would discourage tribal youth from joining militant organisations . 
another participant ,  javed mohmand ,  said that with the completion of such healthy activity ,  their  ( the youths )  future is now secure . 
a tribal elder from mohmand agency ,  malak sher akbar ,  said the barbaric acts of the taliban have exposed their real intentions to the outside world . 
their support among tribal youth is dwindling with every passing month ,  and employment opportunities offered by government and nongovernmental agencies could cause further dents into their enrolment of suicide bombers and volunteer fighters ,  he added . 
rural development project director massod bangash told central asia online that the number of applicants is growing monthly ,  as most of the trained candidates are now leading successful lives and are role models for others in the tribal areas . 
home to the highest quality

 ( photo by massoud hossaini / afp / getty images ) 
aged <num>30</num>  , gulbahari ,  like many afghan women ,  has worked hard her entire life to support her family . 
now ,  the <num>70</num>  $   [ usd ]  monthly salary she receives has significantly improved the quality of life for her family . 
boumi ,  a handiwork and tailoring company ,  was launched in <num>2005</num>  by hassina sherjan . 
sherjan grew up in kabul before moving to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  with her family just before kabul was attacked by the russians . 
in <num>2001</num>  , after the death of her father who also worked in the textile industry ,  she returned to afghanistan . 
she decided to start a company using good quality cotton from pul-e khomri to produce high quality products like curtains ,  cushions covers ,  placemats and napkins with unique colour combinations and patterns . 
afghanistan is known for its dry fruits and carpets . 
i wanted to show the international community that other high quality products can be produced here too ,  she said . 
initially ,  starting with just seven employees ,  boumi has now grown to <num>43</num>  .
the company is rapidly expanding and looking to hire an additional <num>100</num>  to <num>150</num>  workers . 
in kabul ,  the turquoise mountain foundation is another organisation training afghans to produce high quality goods . 
after all the years of fighting ,  i feared this tradition would be gone forever . 
turquoise mountain allows me to teach the old ways to the next generation . 
years of war prompted afghanistan's artists and artisans to flee the country . 
the few that remained were forced to abandon their work and do odd jobs to ensure their day-to-day survival . 
women return to work in swat
the taliban barred women from working in swat . 
as women return to work ,  more job and social service opportunities are needed . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
mingora ,  pakistan - women in swat - the talibans former stronghold - are back on the job ,  and nusrat iqbal feels lucky to be one of them . 
seven months ago it seemed like a nightmare when taliban militants restricted women - almost <num>50</num>  percent of the districts population - to their homes . 
the militants banned employment for women and education for girls . 
nusrat is one of thousands of women in swat who lost their jobs when the taliban took power . 
psychologically ,  i was stressed because of the taliban mayhem ,  but now i am gradually returning to normal life after these bad people were thrown out of the towns and villages of my district ,  she told central asia online . 
nusrat now works for the unicef-funded child protection centre in upper swat district . 
a boom in activities of nongovernmental organisations  ( ngos )  accompanied the return of calm and relative peace after the pakistani military launched operation rah-e-rast in may ,  <num>2009</num>  .
women are entitled to receive <num>50</num>  percent of all available jobs to compensate them for three years of suffering . 
three implementing partners of unicef … have been providing <num>50</num>  percent of jobs to the women … and that is because the women need to be helped to stand on their own feet after undergoing this long ordeal ,  muhammad umar of the aurat foundation said to explain the quota . 
located in the provinciallyadministered tribal areas  ( pata )  ,  swat is home to many industries . 
the government is attempting to spur economic activity by exempting citizens from paying taxes . 
a number of pakistani cosmetic companies operated locally before the conflict ,  and others have now set up operations in the district ,  lured by the tax breaks . 
while eight firms have reportedly hired some <num>1,000</num>  women ,  finding a job remains a challenge . 
very few of these cosmetic industries are operating at the moment because not all women have returned to jobs for different reasons ,  ghani raziq ,  a labour department officer in mingora ,  said . 
asked why women are still hesitant to return to their previous jobs ,  he said ,  the taliban-linked fears will take time to go away from women ,  who were as brutalised by the taliban as the men were . 
shahnaz ,  a former elected councillor and campaigner for womens rights ,  conceded that women are still gripped by  ( taliban-driven )  fears ,  but she said other problems could be stopping women from returning to their jobs at cosmetic industries . 
the wages the women are getting are very low ,  she added . 
safety standards at these workplaces are not good enough to keep women from being harmed . 
raziq agreed ,  the problem is no labour laws are extended to pata . 
so these working women cannot move the court to seek justice . 
women have endured discrimination in many parts of the country ,  acknowledged neelofar bukhtiar ,  a former federal minister for womens development . 
i agree with the notion that women are discriminated against in pakistan even though we have been voicing out against these practises ,  she told central asia online during a trip to peshawar . 
the taliban banned the teaching of girls and the treatment of pregnant or ill women at the patients homes . 
female teachers and healthcare workers whose jobs depended on their ability to visit their patients found themselves prohibited from going out . 
there has not been a single female doctor in matta tehsil to treat pregnant women ,  and in many delivery cases newborn babies died instantly because of delivery complications ,  said a female home health aide who asked not to be identified . 
the health sector was badly affected by the taliban ,  who barred us from administering vaccinations to help children avoid catching deadly diseases like polio ,  she said . 
freed of the taliban ,  she now can administer vaccines to children to keep pakistan free of several diseases the world health organisation hopes to eradicate . 
haqqani ,  al-qaeda and the taliban share links
pakistani taliban militants gather at their base in north waziristan in <num>2008</num>  .
afghan militant commander jalaluddin haqqanis network and the pakistani taliban have teamed up against coalition forces in afghanistan and the military in pakistan . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan - a support network among the militants of jalaluddin haqqani ,  al-qaeda and tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  poses greater challenges than the individual units did to the coalition forces in afghanistan and security forces in pakistan ,  analysts warn . 
there is mutual support among these groups and people to step up attacks inside pakistan and afghanistan ,  imtiaz gul ,  director of an islamabad-based think tank ,  the centre for research and security studies ,  told central asia online by phone . 
one sign of this collaboration is a video showing <num>32</num> -year-old jordanian triple agent humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi ,  who blew himself up at a military base in afghanistans khost province december <num>30</num>  , killing seven others . 
in the video ,  he appeared alongside ttp chief hakeemullah mehsud . 
this message reaffirmed earlier warnings from intelligence agencies about deep links between taliban militants and al-qaeda with groups on both sides of the pakistani-afghan border . 
we will never forget the blood of our amir baitullah mehsud ,  said al-balawi ,  who wore afghan dress in the video . 
baitullah mehsud ,  the ttps longtime leader ,  was killed during a missile strike in august <num>2009</num>  .
the haqqani network ,  very active in the khost ,  paktia and paktika provinces of afghanistan ,  provided logistical support for the jordanian suicide bomber ,  while al-qaeda and the ttp played a supportive role in the mission . 
afghan and coalition forces battling the afghan taliban insurgency blame the haqqani network for most of the attacks they face in southern afghanistan along the pakistani border . 
jalaluddin haqqani moved to north waziristan in <num>1979</num>  as a refugee after the then-soviet union invaded afghanistan and installed a communist regime in kabul . 
in north waziristan ,  haqqani set up a guerrilla war base against the soviet army ,  established training camps and opened recruiting centres to train mujahedeen . 
taking advantage of the influence clerics had in the region ,  haqqani opened a madrassa to attract followers from the religious tribes of north waziristan . 
over this period ,  haqqani amassed piles of weapons and money that enabled him to lead the stiffest resistance to the soviet occupation . 
a formidable base in north waziristan made the haqqani network the strongest group in afghanistans khost ,  paktia and paktika provinces . 
its members are believed to have extended their activities to ghazni ;  they could be responsible for attacks in kabul ,  said yusufzai . 
the afghan war brought haqqani closer to osama bin laden ,  and bin laden fought alongside him in the <num>1980</num>  second  in khost province ,  where the al-qaeda chief set up a training camp . 
in the beginning ,  the pakistani taliban focused on attacking government and coalition forces in afghanistan . 
they found the haqqani group a reliable partner . 
the haqqani group is so important for the pakistani taliban because haqqani serves as the umbrella for almost all shades of militants . 
 [ the pakistani taliban ]  all revere haqqani the senior as much as they revere the al-qaeda leadership ,  gul said . 
observers of terrorism say the haqqani network has ties with al-qaeda and the ttp . 
each group benefits from the other on both sides of the border . 
ultimately ,  the relationship benefits al-qaeda more than haqqani and the ttp by giving it logistical and other support on both sides of the border . 
the hafiz gul bahadar-led taliban group in north waziristan is seen as lending support to the haqqani network in the region ,  and relations between gul bahadar and the pakistani government have been comparatively normal ,  unlike those with the hakeemullah mehsud-led ttp . 
the government signed a peace agreement in north waziristan in september <num>2006</num>  with local tribes ,  and the gul bahadar-led taliban also agreed to the terms . 
this was the first such peace deal in north waziristan . 
it collapsed a year later ,  and targeted killings of pro-government tribal elders began ,  driving many residents to flee . 
some concerned observers have been pressuring islamabad to extend operation rah-e-nijat  ( path to salvation )  to north waziristan ,  where the haqqani network and other militant groups have safe havens . 
however ,  mehmood shah ,  the former security chief in the tribal areas ,  argued it would serve no purpose if you hit  [ the haqqani faction ]  in the tail and not the head . 
unless its head is not hit hard ,  hitting the tail will make little difference .

islamabad - ideology are the ties that bind al-qaeda ,  tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  and punjabi taliban . 
the three groups are driven by the same motive :  to drive international forces out of afghanistan . 
the troikas members are closely connected through a thread of co-operation ,  sharing training facilities ,  sanctuaries ,  human resources and intelligence . 
and recent terrorist acts inside pakistan - which the perpetrators justify by citing pakistans siding with the west in the war on terror - indicate closer operational ties . 
three simultaneous attacks in lahore and one on general headquarters in october indicate the level of collaboration among the terror groups . 
there have been media reports saying that punjabi taliban were killed in drone attacks ,  he told central asia online . 
its obvious how the al-qaeda ,  ttp and punjabi militants are networked . 
what are these punjabi militants doing in waziristan ? 
obviously ,  they are fighting alongside ttp and al-qaeda . 
masood said the increasing co-operation among the three groups is a serious threat to pakistan ,  but that the army and intelligence agencies are aware of it . 
splinter groups of the punjabi taliban have already reached the waziristan area ,  where foreign elements connected with al-qaeda are hiding ,  so there is a connection ,  he said . 
but i wont say that all of the punjabi taliban groups have connections with ttp and al-qaeda . 
…the connection could be clearly defined once the investigations of the major terrorist acts in the country are completed . 
the pakistani army is closely watching the connection and is aware of the rising threat . 
the relationship goes back to the time when the groups fought together against the soviet occupation of afghanistan . 
after september <num>11</num>  , <num>2001</num>  , they formed a closer relationship that intensified after coalition forces entered afghanistan in <num>2001</num>  .
some observers say a <num>2007</num>  military operation against the lal masjid  ( red mosque )  in islamabad ,  the federal capital of pakistan ,  helped further solidify the links among those militant groups . 
according to estimates ,  around <num>5,000</num>  young punjabi men joined militant training centres in north and south waziristan after the action against the red mosque . 
although ttp and al-qaeda initially targeted coalition forces in afghanistan ,  observers say that military operations in the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  led to action inside pakistan . 
ahmed barakat ,  a senior journalist who has extensively covered this region for al jazeera ,  said ,  al-qaeda ,  ttp and militants from punjab used to mainly fight in afghanistan . 
now <abbr>…</abbr>  in pakistan ,  its a reaction to the military operations in fata and pakistans alliance with western countries . 
amir mateen ,  an islamabad-based journalist who closely follows the security situation ,  said ,  punjab is the recruitment ground . 
the nurseries are there . 
madrasas  ( religious schools )  are hatcheries providing human resources . 
al-qaeda is the mastermind that provides planning and training and teaches ideology . 
ttp is providing sanctuaries and training facilities . 
he said the government of pakistan needs to realise the gravity of the situation and act accordingly . 
the breeding ground of terrorists in punjab has to be dealt with . 
the network is fully operational there and may be getting stronger . 
the nexus among al-qaeda ,  ttp and punjabi taliban is a serious threat that may cross the threshold if not attacked in time . 
security forces take control of bajaur
pakistani paramilitary frontier corps troops prepare to show off tunnels used by the taliban in the bajaur district to news media . 
the paramilitary frontier corps  ( fc )  stepped up an offensive targeting taliban havens in the bajaur district after a suicide bombing killed <num>17</num>  at a military checkpoint last week . 
the fc commander said march <num>2</num>  that security forces had taken control of bajaur . 
 [ m . 
ibrahim ] 
khar ,  bajaur -- the pakistani flag was flying high at a former taliban stronghold in damadola ,  a border town of the bajaur tribal region ,  when some top pakistani army leaders visited the area . 
he said foreign militants - including egyptians ,  uzbeks ,  chechens and afghans - were among the <num>75</num>  killed in the bajaur operation . 
analysts say a number of pakistani and foreign taliban members took shelter in the orakzai agency after government forces drove them out of south waziristan . 
a sign of their effective occupation of bajaur was their presence in at least <num>150</num>  caves where they were hiding from air and artillery bombardments that destroyed most of damadolas houses . 
tariq said that the estimated <num>15</num> -<num>25</num>  %  of militants who survived that pounding had either fled to afghanistan or had melted into the local population in swat and adjoining areas . 
earlier ,  civilian and military officials in bajaur told central asia online that they were now in control of damadola ,  sewai ,  nawagai ,  banda-khar and badaan in momand - all once considered militant strongholds . 
they predicted that they would soon clear charmang of militants . 
the taliban had established training centres ,  islamic courts and a network of underground tunnels and bunkers in the sewai ,  damadola and banda areas . 
sewai was the headquarters of the taliban and their foreign sympathisers in bajaur . 
after the start of the military operation in <num>2008</num>  , the security forces secured and re-established almost all the checkpoints that the taliban either seized or blew up . 
all these checkpoints had strategic locations and were a constant cause of concern for security forces when under the control of the taliban ,  a military officer in charge of the bajaur operation said . 
facing relentless pressure from the army ,  some taliban commanders ,  including masud salar ,  surrendered . 
local residents considered salar a close aide to the taliban leader in bajaur ,  mulana faqir muhammad ,  and said salar had a strong say in the affairs of the taliban shura in bajaur . 
reports are circulating that some of the runaway taliban are regrouping in charmang under the leadership of qari ziaur rehman ,  an afghan-pakistani militant commander . 
some military observers and analysts said the leader of the swat taliban ,  mullah fazlullah ,  is hiding in charmang . 
local residents are apprehensive about possible reprisals by the taliban ,  unless troops can flush them out of bajaur . 
meanwhile ,  there are reports of a rift between top taliban leaders in bajaur . 
analysts say mula dadullah ,  who has the tacit support of qari ziaur rehman ,  has supplanted faqir muhammad as the militants leader . 
it is also rumoured that faqir muhammad ,  who is second-in-command of the tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  ,  has tactically retreated from his position because of growing criticism within the taliban ranks and widespread rejection of taliban policies . 
he ,  in fact ,  was looking for a safe exit ,  which his own colleagues provided to him ,  observed sahibzada bahauddin ,  a local journalist . 
baradars arrest confirms presence of afghan taliban in pakistan
pakistani soldiers search the vehicles of afghan nationals at the chaman border crossing february <num>23</num>  .
pakistani authorities beefed up security there after afghan and coalition forces launched an operation against the taliban in afghanistans helmand province . 
 [ asghar achakzai / afp / getty images ] 
after the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan in <num>2001</num>  , it was theorised that most members of the taliban government in kabul crossed into pakistans northwestern city of peshawar . 
now they are said to be infiltrating other areas . 
askari-rizvi said the afghan taliban likely considered pakistan the safest place for them because of sympathisers to unite strident nationalism with militancy and to emphasise that pakistans troubles are caused by its foreign adversaries . 
a pakistani intelligence officer ,  who asked not to be named ,  told central asia online that military operations in waziristan are pushing an increasing number of taliban fighters into areas northeast of quetta and other parts of balochistan ,  adjacent to the noshki district that links with the afghan border area shorawak . 
the main taliban factions ,  such as those led by jalaluddin haqqani and mullah omar ,  get support on the pakistani side of the border . 
some diplomatic sources told central asia online ,  the taliban resistance movement has apparently chosen zabul ,  spin boldak ,  kandahar and helmand as the areas where it has to re-establish its authority . 
these areas are well suited to crossing the durand line ,  which separates pakistan from afghanistan ,  because of unprotected trails that are impossible to patrol ,  sources added . 
masood added that while strikes against the afghan taliban were aimed at pressuring the militants to join peace negotiations ,  the process would be constrained and even now there would be limits as to what pakistan can do to persuade the afghan taliban to agree to reconciliation in afghanistan . 
the recent strike against the taliban in helmand province drove out many afghan nationals . 
they became easily visible in pakistan . 
after the recent arrest of afghan taliban leaders in karachi and faisalabad ,  pakistan has widened its hunt for the leaders of the afghan taliban in the non-tribal areas of the country ,  including quetta ,  kuchlaak ,  pishin ,  chaman ,  jungle peer-alizai ,  surkhab ,  noshki ,  and particularly in karachi ,  intelligence sources told central asia online . 
pakistani security agencies are hunting senior afghan taliban leadership thought to be hiding in the country . 
meanwhile ,  government forces have detained a number of taliban leaders . 
these leaders include mullah obaidullah akhundzada ,  mullah abdul nabi ,  molvi abdul nasim naeemi ,  noor mohammad saqib , sakhidad mujahid ,  mullah abdul ghani bradar ,  ameer muaaviya ,  akhunzada popalzai ,  mula hamza akhwand ,  mullah abdul salaam mullah mohammad and molvi karim dad . 
sources said pakistani security agencies have tried to set up informant networks in the tribal areas ,  but militants have exposed and executed many of those informants . 
moulvi noor muhammad ,  a leader of the tehreek-e-nifaze and a taliban supporter ,  said the claim that the afghan taliban are operating from pakistans soil is creating a dilemma for the pakistani government . 
despite the fall of the taliban regime in afghanistan way back in october <num>2001</num>  , the … taliban and al-qaeda fighters in afghanistan have gained strength and are getting stronger with every passing day after regrouping and reorganising their resistance movement in <abbr>…</abbr>  afghanistan ,  he said . 
pakistani security agencies in the past couple of years have arrested more than <num>300</num>  afghan taliban members . 
many of those arrests were made in hospitals . 
according to several hospital sources ,  taliban fighters in afghanistan bring their comrades across the border into pakistan for treatment after being wounded in battle . 
the injured fighters receive medical care by pretending to be locals . 
pakistani officials denied claims from the afghan government that their military intelligence is providing support and safe havens for the taliban . 
the only true taliban shura is the one led by taliban chief mullah muhammad omar . 
it has <num>28</num>  members and ,  according to some reports ,  it is spread around afghanistan . 
some of the members are even holding key government posts . 
according to some media reports ,  to stop the afghan taliban and other militants from illegally entering pakistan ,  the government has stationed <num>80,000</num>  troops and set up more then <num>1,000</num>  checkpoints along the long pak-afghan border . 
fatwa outlaws  " terrorism and suicide bombings " 
the stance of this pakistani-born religious scholar regarding al-qaeda's actions is nothing new . 
in his lengthy fatwa ,  sheikh qadri argued that those who carry out suicide bombings will be punished with hellfire ,  refuting the fact that suicide bombers will be rewarded with paradise and its maidens . 
he said that islamic teachings categorically reject attacks which kill innocent people ,  indicating that islam forbids killing a single innocent person even if the attack in which that person would be killed would also cause the death of dozens of miscreants . 
qadri included in his fatwa the opinions from many important scholars ,  both modern and ancient ,  who reject what al-qaeda and the taliban consider lawful ,  and he called them the  " kharijites of our time .  " 
qadri ,  born in <num>1951</num>  in pakistan's punjab province ,  received his ph . d .  from punjab university . 
the title of his thesis was  '  ' the islamic penal system and its philosophy . 
 '  '  he has served as a lecturer in islamic sciences since <num>1974</num>  and practised the legal profession from <num>1976</num>  to <num>1978</num>  in pakistan . 
he was also a legal advisor in the federal shariat court ,  the pakistani high court and a member of the national committee for islamic curriculum at the pakistani ministry of education . 
qadri said ,   " look at our deplorable situation today . 
people are killed inside mosques and on the streets . 
they are killed while sleeping in their beds . 
terrorists bomb marketplaces where women ,  children and the elderly get killed . 
there is no justification for this at all . 
these al-qaeda and taliban terrorists are smearing the image of islam by randomly killing innocent people in pakistan ,  saudi arabia ,  afghanistan ,  iraq ,  new york ,  london and madrid .  " 
undoubtedly ,  qadri is aware of the fact that it would be difficult for him to convince all the members of al-qaeda to change their beliefs ,  saying that they have been subjected to  " brainwashing "  . 
however ,  his main concern is the new generation of islamist youths who could be attracted to the ideology of al-qaeda . 
that is why he wants them to read his fatwa in order to learn about the qur ' anic verses ,  prophetic traditions ,  stories of the caliphs and the companions ,  and the opinions of the scholars in the hope that they would be convinced of the wrongness of al-qaeda and the taliban ,  and all the groups that support them . 
it pointed to the fact that qadri's organisation ,  minhaj-ul-quran ,   " has hundreds of thousands of followers throughout south asia and in the uk "  ,  and that his stance  " has set a precedent for other scholars to condemn in a similar fashion the ideas that support terrorism .  " 
a quilliam spokesperson said in a statement at a press conference in london that  " this fatwa could represent a major step towards eradicating islamic terrorism . 
the fatwas of religious scholars influenced by the wahhabi ideology and those of islamic theoreticians have been the progenitors of terrorism against civilians in recent times . 
terrorist groups such as al-qaeda continue to justify their mass killing based on interpretations of scriptural texts that suit their interests . 
but fatwas that expose the truth behind these innovations in fiqh  ( islamic jurisprudence )  such as the fatwa of qadri will send islamic terrorism to the dust bin of history .  " 
regardless of qadri's fatwa and quilliam's remarks ,  there is a clear trend within islamic movements to be critical of al-qaeda and the taliban and counter their ideologies . 
revisions made by many islamist scholars and leaders of islamic movements during the past few years have unanimously condemned random killing and bombing of civilians ,  regardless of whether the primary targets are soldiers which al-qaeda and the taliban describe as infidels or apostates . 
kidnapping ,  hijacking main sources of pakistan taliban funding
taliban fighters guard trucks hijacked in the khyber agency in this <num>2009</num>  file photo . 
 [ mehmood jan ] 
islamabad ,  pakistan -- trying to cut off funding for the pakistani taliban is no small challenge ,  but some pakistanis can at least identify its sources . 
kidnapping high-profile figures and government officials for ransom is a primary source of income . 
it is very much evident who was behind the kidnapping of tariq aziz ud din ,  a former pakistani ambassador to afghanistan ,  khan said . 
one kidnap victim was abdur rehman zazai ,  a peshawar-based afghan business tycoon . 
his family delivered the ransom in dollars . 
zazai ,  upon regaining his freedom ,  promptly moved himself and his family to dubai . 
in this type of case ,  the route of payments is peshawar to dubai and sometimes abu dhabi through hawala and hundi ,  the informal <abbr>…</abbr>  means of payment ,  said a federal investigation agency  ( fia )  official who asked not to be named . 
people in peshawar may deposit money with the local hawala and hundi holders without fulfilling any legal requirement ,  and within minutes the cash has reached its destination . 
hawala and hundi live on as popular means of transferring money internationally to family members . 
muslims living abroad who have little religious knowledge believe that islam forbids them to use the banking system ,  so they rely on the systems they know . 
the popularity of such informal cash transfer systems makes efforts to crack down on suspect banking accounts only marginally useful ,  khan said . 
money for holy causes does not come through formal routes ,  khan said . 
hawala and hundi are difficult for authorities to curb ,  said peshawar-based journalist mohammad ali . 
after the <num>9</num>  / <num>11</num>  attacks ,  a law against money laundering was introduced in pakistan . 
however ,  he said ,  efforts to crack down on illicit transfers have barely dented the annual remittances estimated at us <num>4</num>  $  billion . 
in his view ,  the system has the capacity to deliver us <num>15</num>  $  billion a year ,  since its users are switching to permissible channels . 
the authorities however say they can handle the problem . 
asad ali ,  an fia official in islamabad ,  said ,  pakistan is vigilant in controlling illegal and suspected money transactions ,  and a special investigation group  ( sig )  has been established in the federal investigation agency of pakistan for this purpose . 
the new law against money laundering also compels banks to provide records of any transactions to the fia if it demands them ,  he added . 
hijacking afghan coalition vehicles and stealing international equipment and weapons are another major source of militant funding . 
these looted items are being openly sold in pakistan and afghanistans markets ,  a tribal businessman in khyber agency told central asia online . 
i still remember the words of hakeemullah mehsud  ( leader of the tehrik-e-taliban pakistan )  ,  when he said that  ( his organisation )  didnt care who was supporting its cause ,  said haroon rashid ,  senior correspondent for the bbc urdu service in islamabad . 
local donations ,  particularly collected on the pretext of helping impoverished madrassa students ,  constitute a major chunk of this aid . 
pakistan military to end south waziristan operations march <num>30</num> 
pakistan army troops patrol near ladha in south waziristan in this november <num>2009</num>  file photo . 
pakistans military is preparing to wind down its operations in the region . 
kayani ,  while briefing officials march <num>15</num>  at a high-level meeting presided over by president asif ali zardari concerning the south waziristan agency ,  stated that an exit strategy is ready . 
he reportedly told the officials that the military would wrap up their operations in the militant stronghold by the end of this month . 
however ,  troops will remain in south waziristan to maintain security . 
kayani said the operation attained its major goals . 
vigorous ground and air offensives against hardcore militants began in south waziristan in mid-october of last year . 
the militants have been dislodged ,  and the military has taken control of south waziristan ,  once the militants stronghold ,  talat told central asia online . 
however ,  masood said the military is still facing resistance from pockets of militants in the area . 
the militants need to be eliminated . 
if not ,  they might stage a comeback ,  he said . 
masood added that it is essential for the military to keep up its holding operation until it had cleansed the area completely of militants and their backers . 
to win their  ( tribesmens )  support ,  the first challenge for the government is the honourable return and resettlement of the internally displaced tribesmen . 
however ,  senior journalist and tribal affairs observer rahimullah yusufzai questions whether the military fully controls south waziristan . 
twenty percent of the area still needs to be cleared ,  he said . 
the military is also facing attacks in the places that it controls . 
yusufzai agrees with masood on one matter :  the major post-operation problem for the government is the honourable return of internally displaced persons  ( idps )  . 
idps and their elders are reluctant to go back ,  he said . 
they conditioned their return on the restoration of peace and security and compensation for their destroyed properties . 
yusufzai said tribal elders will not put much faith in government promises of compensation . 
the idps believe the government didnt fulfil its earlier promises of compensation for damage done in previous operations ,  he said . 
he also said that it was too difficult for the civilian administration to take primary responsibility at this stage ,  and that the military will have to remain there for a long time . 
complete withdrawal is not an option at this stage ,  according to him . 
another senior defence analyst and former security chief of the federally administered tribal areas ,  brigadier mehmood shah ,  said the military completed its task far ahead of schedule . 
however ,  he advised commanders not to burden their forces with development work . 
involving the military in reconstruction and developmental activities is not good ,  as this experience failed in swat and malakand division ,  shah told central asia online . 
he added that security and intelligence lapses have permitted terrorists to pull off periodic bombings and suicide attacks . 
given those bitter experiences ,  shah recommends the civilian administration supervise development and reconstruction in south waziristan ,  while the military focuses on security . 
the civilian administration will also have to address the major problem of resettling hundreds of thousands of idps ,  he said . 
speaker of the national assembly fahmida mirza presides over a session of the lower house of the pakistani parliament . 
according to a free and fair election network report ,  women in parliament did more work than men during the past two years . 
 [ abdullah jan ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- female parliamentarians in pakistan were more vocal and active than their male counterparts in the lower house ,  the national assembly ,  over the past two years ,  according to a new report . 
 ( female members )  accounted for more than half of the parliamentary business conducted during the second parliamentary year <abbr>…</abbr>  ,  the non-profit free and fair election network said in a report . 
headed by a female speaker ,  pakistans <num>342</num> -member national assembly has <num>76</num>  female members . 
that figure includes <num>60</num>  seats reserved specifically for women drawn from four provinces . 
the largest federating unit ,  punjab ,  has <num>35</num>  female members ,  followed by sindh with <num>14</num>  .
the north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  and balochistan have eight and three female members ,  respectively . 
the assembly has <num>16</num>  other female members who won their seats in the february <num>2008</num>  general elections . 
all members of parliament enjoy identical status on the floor of the house . 
woman members have been more active ,  assertive and effective voices of citizens than their male counterparts ,  stated the report ,  released march <num>8</num>  , international womens day . 
farhat khan ,  a member of parliament ,  said pakistani women are more sensitive to the needs of the people than their male counterparts are . 
we women are practically facing the realities of life and gaining more independence ,  she said . 
that experience translates into female lawmakers work ,  she said . 
the observation of proceedings of the  ( assembly )  demonstrates greater interest and active participation of woman members ,  on average ,  as compared to their male counterparts ,  says the report . 
most of the woman members in the national assembly are educated and familiar with parliamentary business ,  said deputy mehrun nisa afridi ,  a member of the pakistan peoples party  ( ppp )  . 
afridi claimed to have jointly tabled with both male and female members many questions and other parliamentary business . 
the report says women tabled <num>1,826</num>  questions in one year . 
by comparison ,  men put forward <num>1,488</num>  questions  ( <num>45</num>  %  )  . 
women came up with <num>23</num>  resolutions ,  compared with <num>13</num>  tabled by men . 
however ,  only <num>16</num>  of the womens resolutions could be put up for discussion before the house . 
the best-known resolution against terrorism and militancy ,  passed by an in-camera joint sitting of the upper and lower chambers october <num>2008</num>  , was tabled by <num>17</num>  legislators ,  including two women . 
similarly ,  the national assembly unanimously adopted a resolution in january <num>2009</num>  condemning the violation of womens rights by militants in the swat valley . 
another four female parliamentarians were among the movers of a resolution this year that condemned publication of caricatures of the prophet muhammad  ( pbuh )  . 
woman parliamentarians are more sensitive toward social issues ,  afridi said . 
she said they pay more attention to issues faced by common citizens . 
nineteen private member bills were introduced by a woman independently and another <num>14</num>  by more than one woman . 
ten similar bills were jointly sponsored by members of both sexes . 
male members brought only four such bills independently . 
parliamentary interventions of women were focused on a broad array of issues relating to high and low politics ,  evidencing their focus on diverse matters of national importance and their desire to address them in democratic ways ,  the report said . 
the report finds women in the opposition more active than those from the ruling alliance . 
opposition members have liberty to speak in the house ,  and at times their only intention is to embarrass the government side ,  farhat said . 
female members making it into the house on reserved seats were found to be more active than those elected directly ,  and female members from punjab contributed more than their counterparts from the other three provinces ,  the report said . 
it also referred to vital issues when female lawmakers went silent . 
a prominent instance was the brokering of a deal between the nwfp government and the taliban militia in the swat valley . 
female members didnt raise implications about the people  ( of swat )  in general and women in particular ,  according to the study ,  even though ,  as mentioned above ,  they denounced violation of women's rights in swat in january <num>2009</num>  .
qadri :  jihad without state sanction is massacre
islamic scholar and spiritual leader shaykh-ul-islam tahir-ul qadri delivers a fatwa on terrorism march <num>2</num>  in london . 
in an interview ,  qadri told central asia online that only a government can declare jihad - and that many militants are nothing but criminals using the quran to justify terrorism . 
 [ dan kitwood / getty images ] 
islamabad ,  pakistan - islamic scholars and leaders have been reluctant for too long to speak out publicly against terrorists who justify themselves on islamic grounds ,  says tahir-ul-qadri . 
religious leaders condemned terrorism in their own ways ,  which could not be rendered into a collective stand against perpetrators of terror ,  qadri told central asia online in an email interview . 
qadri appealed to religious scholars to condemn terrorism in all forms . 
other scholars ,  he said ,  have limited their denunciations of terrorism and suicide bombings to brief statements . 
yet another group of scholars stayed silent to protect vested interests…or <abbr>…</abbr>  because of their sects beliefs ,  he said . 
it is mandatory for a muslim army to fight against terrorists ,  and those soldiers who sacrificed their lives are martyrs in the true sense ,  qadri said . 
i have <abbr>…</abbr>  made it clear in the light of quranic injunctions ,  sayings of the holy prophet and jurisprudential opinion that foreign coercion and oppression unleashed against the muslims cannot be a justifiable reason for terrorism <abbr>…</abbr>  or to wage an armed rebellion against the muslim state ,  he said . 
as for pakistani-based organisations fighting in indian-controlled kashmir ,  qadri said the indigenous kashmiri struggle lost its international appeal when jihadists infiltrated the kashmiri self-determination movement . 
these so-called jihadi elements developed their own agendas ,  which were harmful for the kashmir cause ,  and when pakistan tightened security on the border with kashmir  ( after )  <num>9</num>  / <num>11</num>  ,  ( the jihadists )  turned their guns against the state ,  said qadri ,  twice a member of the pakistani parliament . 
the extremists invoke  ( the palestinian territories and kashmir )  as a reflection of the worlds double standards for recruitment of muslim youth ,  he said . 
talking about the concept of jihad in islam ,  qadri said the islamic concept of jihad is quite dynamic and inclusive ,  but that extremists have reduced the idea to one of killing . 
a straight and big no  ,  qadri wrote to central asia online in reply to a query about declaration of jihad by non-state actors in islam . 
power to declare jihad has been vested in the state and no non-state actor is allowed to do so in islam . 
if it does <abbr>…</abbr>  it would be nothing but massacre of humanity and revolt against the state ,  qadri said . 
qadri said the possibility of a militant leader challenging him to a debate on the merits of his fatwa did not concern him . 
most militants ,  leaders and followers alike ,  are ignorant ,  even illiterate ,  he said . 
most of them are criminals and have masked themselves as jihadi leaders . 
they know only the language of arms ,  he said . 
however ,  should his opponents be serious ,  i would ask such a person to come up with even a few-page academic rebuttal of my fatwa ,  he said . 
pakistanis enjoying spring pursue their normal activities
as spring unfolds in pakistan ,  residents throng maal road ,  muree hilltop ,  <num>45</num>  kilometer  north of the capital ,  islamabad . 
pakistanis are defying terrorism by leading normal lives and enjoying spring . 
 [ sohail ahmed ] 
the arrival of spring is as good a reason as any . 
its a time for picnicking outdoors and enjoying nature in its glory - trees sprouting buds ,  the grass peeking up through the earth ,  and flowers coming into bloom in an array of colours . 
we cannot compromise on entertainment and… we get bored staying in our houses the whole day ,  said tahira ,  a woman in islamabad ,  when asked why pakistanis risk their safety for the sake of family fun . 
a twin-blast militant attack in lahore march <num>12</num>  rocked the arrival of spring . 
it killed more than <num>60</num>  people and injured more than <num>150</num>  .
more explosions came that night in iqbaltown . 
we used to go out every weekend ,  even though the situation is not good for heading out ,  tahira said . 
but we have to live in the given circumstances . 
here are some ways pakistanis are enjoying spring . 
the pakistan national monument adjacent to shakarparian ,  islamabads beloved picnic spot ,  is attracting many nature and art lovers . 
as terrorists resort to their inhuman behaviour and play havoc with the lives of innocent citizens ,  we too are determined to face the challenges . 
families from the twin cities of rawalpindi and islamabad thronged the place to enjoy the lush green scenery and rawal lake . 
we want to enjoy life and move freely ,  setting aside tensions and risks . 
one ,  aamir khans three idiots ,  has been showing in pakistan for the past month and a half . 
despite the prevailing law-and-order situation in the country ,  we have full houses on most weekends ,  said the clerk ,  who requested anonymity . 
we should not fear terrorism . 
we should face it with bold courage instead ,  but the government should carry out more security measures as well . 
the film hauled in a record indian rs <num>700</num>  meter   ( us <num>700</num>  meter  )  across the subcontinent in four weeks and is in its seventh week in rawalpindi . 
filmgoers appreciate its theme ,  said jehanzeb ,  manager of the cinema . 
my name is khan is about an indian-born muslims battle against being stereotyped as a terrorist . 
shah rukh khan ,  the star ,  can link the film to personal experience . 
when he arrived in the west to promote the film ,  he endured protracted questioning by security officials at one international airport because their computer flagged his name as suspicious . 
then ,  there is shopping . 
marketplaces are flooded by crowds out to eat and shop . 
bilal ,  a waiter ,  said the restaurant stays busy until all hours of the night . 
though the lahore blasts spread a fear among the people and our workload remained low for a day ,  you can see the rush of people now ,  he said . 
the jinnah super market increased security after the march <num>12</num>  bombing ,  said ashraf ,  a security officer at the main entrance of the market ,  which attracts well-to-do- pakistanis and foreigners . 
all told ,  despite the prevailing law-and-order situation ,  locals are eager to take part in recreational activities . 
the morale of the people is higher than ever ,  and whenever there is some  ( negative )  event ,  their participation is encouraging to us ,  said khalid javed ,  director general of the lok virsa theatre and museum . 
sometimes ,  we avoid holding some event as a precautionary measure . 
otherwise ,  the participation of the public is always very motivating . 
<num>8</num>  killed ,  many wounded in peshawar blasts
pakistani soldiers take positions after a huge bomb blast april <num>5</num>  in peshawar . 
eight individuals ,  including six attackers ,  were killed when heavily armed militants tried to storm a foreign consulate in peshawar . 
suspected islamist militants waged a series of attacks in northwest pakistan ,  including one that targeted a political rally and killed more than <num>40</num>  people . 
 [ a majeed / afp / getty images ] 
peshawar - a series of explosions and armed attacks by suspected militants killed at least eight and wounded more than a dozen people april <num>5</num>  in pakistans north-western city of peshawar ,  police said . 
the bombs went off within <num>15</num>  minutes of each other ,  part of an attack that included heavily armed terrorists trying to storm the us consulate . 
the violence took place an hour after a suicide bombing at a political rally in dir district ,  about <num>300</num>  kilometer  from peshawar ,  that killed at least <num>40</num>  individuals and injured more than <num>80</num>  .
at least two of the dead were security officers . 
many people ,  including schoolchildren ,  were trapped inside their workplaces and schools during the violence . 
in the street ,  chaos and snarled traffic resulted ,  and panicked callers overloaded the mobile telephone system . 
nwfp senior minister bashir ahmad bilour told journalists the assault on the consulate in peshawar came from different sides . 
six terrorists were also killed in a gunfight with police and security  ( personnel )  ,  the senior minister said . 
official sources said terrorists armed with rocket launchers ,  grenades and suicide jackets stormed the heavily guarded consulate from three sides . 
he said the other blasts followed at <num>13</num>  : <num>29</num>  and <num>13</num>  : <num>34</num>  .
a senior police official ,  karim khan ,  said the assailants arrived in one vehicle ,  but other reports said two vehicles were involved . 
upon arriving ,  one militant detonated his suicide jacket near the consulates main entrance . 
a tehreek-e-taliban pakistan spokesman claimed responsibility in a phone call to news media and said his organisation would conduct more such attacks . 
war-weary afghans want peace
colourful balloons are prepared for release as an afghan football team parades during a peace festival on nader khan hill ,  overlooking kabul ,  september <num>23</num>  .
the afghan people are fed up with decades of wars and want peace . 
 [ romeo gacad / afp / getty images ] 
kabul -- tired of decades-long wars and internecine conflicts ,  the people of afghanistan want peace at any cost . 
representatives of a cross-section of society in kabul ,  while talking to central asia online ,  said their only demand from the afghan government and international community is the restoration of peace . 
it is hell ,  not a country ,  said rahimullah ,  a low-level government official who declined to give his last name ,  when he was asked to describe afghanistan . 
rahimullah said that had the taliban not committed blunders like degrading women ,  closing schools and forcefully implementing sharia ,  the population would have accepted them . 
professor wadeer safi ,  head of the faculty of law ,  international relations and political science in kabul university ,  said the population is fed up with war . 
they think nobody is interested in the peoples problems ,  safi said . 
there is no peace and stability . 
officials are corrupt ,  and the international community is unmindful of peoples problems . 
safi said afghanistan is a battleground for international and regional powers that are fighting for their own interests . 
every country - iran ,  pakistan ,  russia and india - has proxies here . 
they want to settle scores against each other on afghan soil ,  safi said . 
i appeal to the world to let afghans put their own house in order . 
afghans have the capacity and instruments to do so if left alone . 
the country has nothing except fighting ,  suicide blasts ,  corruption and bad governance ,  he said . 
anayatullah amin ,  <num>19</num>  , a student of fine arts at kabul university ,  said afghans are human beings ,  not animals ,  who need to live in peace . 
with an expression of hopelessness on his face ,  amin said afghans do not want to fight . 
unfortunately ,   ( other countries )  are not interested in peace in afghanistan ,  he said . 
you tell me who were controlling different groups of the mujahedeen ,  who produced the taliban and who was supporting the northern alliance . 
amin continued ,  the communists ,  mujahedeen ,  and the taliban all have destroyed afghanistan . 
all are responsible for the present situation . 
he added that no one is listening to those who are dying for peace . 
the time is ripe for talks and negotiation ,  as everybody ,  including the taliban ,  has the realisation that the people of afghanistan want peace and an end to fighting ,  din muhammad said . 
din muhammad won respect in afghanistan because of his familys role in the afghan jihad . 
he is the younger brother of known mujahedeen leaders abdul haq and haji qadeer . 
din muhammad ,  who is the probable future liaison of the government with the taliban ,  said he was confident that the taliban would agree to negotiate peace once somebody makes honest efforts in this regard . 
he said neighbouring countries also want resolution of the afghan issue now . 
pakistan and iran have the understanding that the afghan issue needs to be resolved soon as further prolongation is not in their interests ,  din muhammad said . 
india ,  china ,  russia and other powers share that view ,  he said . 
for elderly gul sanga ,  her only wish is to see afghanistan as it was during the reign of the last king ,  mohammad zahir shah ,  who ruled from <num>1933</num> -<num>1973</num>  .
sanga ,  now in her <num>60</num>  second  and an employee at a guesthouse ,  has lost several relatives in the prolonged conflict . 
the mujahedeen destroyed afghanistan . 
guns smuggling on the rise in balochistan
quetta - police initially thought they had their man . 
four years ago ,  after seizing three truckloads of heavy weapons at dasht ,  the southern area of mastung district ,  police and crimes investigation department  ( cid )  officials accused a nearby farmer ,  hazaar khan kurd ,  of owning the weapons . 
authorities later determined that smugglers had brought in the weapons from afghanistan and that they did not belong to the farmer . 
cid balochistan eventually charged the official with involvement in heavy weapons smuggling . 
the quetta anti-terrorist court issued arrest warrants for the minister ,  but no action followed . 
locally purchased guns mostly <abbr>…</abbr>  go to gangsters and terrorists . 
ishaq ali changaizi ,  an investigative officer for balochistan crime branch ,  said ,  it is a matter of concern for all of us that some elements are pushing heavier weapons from afghanistan ,  where they have easy access to these weapons . 
changaizi said security forces have focused on popular smuggling points and have foiled several smuggling operations . 
the culprits often use fruit crates to deliver guns to antigovernment elements and miscreants . 
balochistan is not only a smuggling destination ;  it now holds stockpiles of illegal weapons ,  said qazi abdul wahid ,  deputy inspector general of balochistan police . 
we have reports that some smugglers are stockpiling heavier weapons in different parts of balochistan ,  he said . 
militants are still getting weapons from afghanistan ,  as they did during the talibans reign ,  he added . 
when asked why security agencies are not cracking down on those involved in the weapons racket ,  he replied ,  we all are trying our best to halt these bids ;  militants are <abbr>…</abbr>  taking advantage of a long porous border . 
in that time ,  fc and local police have made <num>55</num>  arrests in connection with charges of antistate activities . 
however ,  for narcotics ,  arms and ammunition there is no limit . 
they can be seized anywhere in the province . 
various powers have their interests in central asia ,  and balochistan is the key strategic location ,  said kamran khan ,  a defence analyst and former senator . 
they do not want stability in here . 
i think without foreign support ,  heavier arms could not be smuggled into balochistan ,  he said . 
the lucrative gun-running business is supporting gang warfare in balochistan and other provinces . 
khan agreed that border issues are the biggest reason for the growth in arms trafficking . 
but additional law enforcement efforts could curb the smuggling ,  he said . 
past governments have made half-hearted efforts to seize illicit arms or regularise the sale of weapons . 
one such attempt was made by the nawaz sharif government ,  but it ended in a dismal failure ,  he said . 
a major hurdle <abbr>…</abbr>  is the inability of our rulers to ensure the rule of law and to refuse exemptions to the privileged few . 
the balochistan government has decided to strictly enforce a ban on the public display of arms and to stop individuals from moving around with armed bodyguards . 
but hamid shakil sabir of balochistan police and district police officer qilla abdullah-chaman told central asia online that they lack sufficient resources to patrol the entire border . 
additionally ,  they said many smugglers have too much clout to be stopped . 
in balochistan ,  smugglers of heavier weapons are broadly known as those who allegedly have support from some higher-ups across the border and from some in tribal areas ,  which are half in pakistan and half in afghanistan ,  sabir said . 
the long ,  mostly unpatrolled border touches afghanistans kandahar ,  zabul and helmand provinces . 
we have raised many times the complaint that the smugglers get their supplies from there . 
but they <abbr>…</abbr>  operate without fear and hindrance . 
pakistan fights taliban effort to shut down education
the government matani primary school is shown after it was bombed in early <num>2010</num>  .
the talibans war on education has led to a drop in student enrolment in the north west frontier province . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
peshawar -- hamna afridi ,  <num>11</num>  , was getting ready for school one day and heard a bang . 
hamnas government-run primary school in gemany kelay ,  <num>35</num>  kilometer  south of peshawar ,  was blown up in march <num>2008</num>  .
suspected militants have damaged or destroyed more than <num>70</num>  %  of schools in the area ,  forcing some parents to keep their children from going to school . 
for the past few years ,  the area has been a stronghold of the taliban ,  who have made their presence felt by destroying educational institutions and music stores . 
all told ,  militants have bombed the lone girls college ,  two high schools ,  half a dozen middle schools and almost two dozen primary schools in darra adamkhel . 
but darra adamkhel is not alone . 
many parents in south and north waziristan ,  orakzai ,  khyber ,  kurram ,  mohmand and bajaur tribal agencies and elsewhere have stopped sending their children ,  especially girls ,  to schools and colleges . 
a suicide bombing near a girls school in lower dir killed seven people ,  including three coalition soldiers ,  in january . 
attacks on education have gained frequency ,  as suspected militants bombed a handful of schools in khyber ,  mohmand ,  orakzai ,  hangu and other areas in a one-week in the last week . 
that streak of violence followed a rough start to the year . 
the taliban blew up <num>16</num>  schools in the tribal regions of mohmand ,  bajaur ,  khyber and darra adamkhel during february ,  said north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  education minister sardar hussain babak . 
the trouble in darra adamkhel started in early <num>2007</num>  when the local administration ,  taking militant threats seriously ,  directed young female students to wear traditional white burqas on the way to schools . 
but that move didnt satisfy the militants . 
not only schools in darra adamkhel but also institutions in several villages of peshawar ,  sharing boundaries with the tribal areas ,  have been subjected to bombings or rocket attacks in recent years . 
the lone girls high school in badaber ,  where girls from peshawar were receiving instruction ,  was bombed last year . 
many of the students have not come to school since then ,  while others are attending classes in a temporary building without basic facilities ,  said mohammad imran ,  the father of two school-going daughters . 
he admits to worrying all day about their safety until their mother calls him to say they have reached home . 
qaisar afridi ,  a resident of sherkera ,  said militants blew up schools in nearby villages but that his town remained safe . 
however ,  parents are really worried about the safety of their children when they go to school ,  he said . 
in <num>2007</num>  , about <num>290,000</num>  students ,  male and female ,  were enrolled in primary schools ;  another <num>269,000</num>  were enrolled in middle schools ,  high schools ,  higher secondary schools ,  colleges ,  mosque schools ,  community model schools and industrial homes in the federally administered tribal areas . 
however ,  a report released in february by unesco disclosed that pakistan has seen a huge increase in attacks on schools in two years ,  with <num>356</num>  schools destroyed or damaged . 
the violence drove down enrolment in schools and colleges of tribal areas ,  especially that of girls . 
according to some statistics ,  in the swat district ,  <num>172</num>  schools suffered damage or outright destruction between <num>2007</num>  and march <num>2009</num>  , depriving <num>23,000</num>  girls and <num>17,000</num>  boys of their education . 
in december <num>2008</num>  , the taliban warned girls schools in swat to close or face attack . 
five hundred state-run schools and <num>400</num>  private schools subsequently shut down ,  affecting more than <num>40,000</num>  students . 
the situation has improved to a great extent as classes have resumed in makeshift schools for boys and girls ,  said mohammad idrees ,  deputy inspector general investigation nwfp . 
a special school securing wing  ( ssw )  has been established to ensure security for academic institutions all over swat . 
dalits demand their rights
pakistan has nearly <num>3</num>  meter  hindus ,  <num>75</num>  %  of whom are dalits . 
about <num>70</num>  dalit families have moved from aakli to the plains near mithi ,  where they are protesting the abduction of their women and demanding security . 
tharparkar ,  pakistan - long accustomed to discrimination ,  pakistan's hindu dalits are fighting a new form of harassment that is driving them from their ancestral villages in the tharparkar district of sindh . 
about <num>70</num>  dalit families have left to protest the growing incidence of kidnapping of their young women . 
the kidnapping typically leads to rape or forced conversion to islam and marriage . 
that fate befell a <num>15</num> -year-old dalit girl ,  daya ,  recently ,  the dalits say . 
kidnappers snatched and forcibly converted her ,  after which a local muslim landlord ,  mumtaz hangorio ,  married her ,  said arjan meghawar ,  a dalit . 
 " daya <abbr>…</abbr>  was kidnapped when the entire family was asleep "  ,  he told central asia online . 
 " they were told that she converted to islam in a local madrassa "  . 
her family have been unable to see her ,  he said ,  calling that situation typical for the families of such kidnapping victims . 
 " the kidnappers have ordered the dalit community to stay quiet ;  otherwise ,  they will abduct more girls "  ,  meghawar said . 
the minimum age for marriage in pakistan is <num>16</num>  .
daya was the second dalit girl victimised by men from the majority community ,  according to the dalits . 
local men kidnapped and gang-raped kasturi ,  <num>17</num>  , on january <num>24</num>  , said veerjee ,  head of the kohli association . 
the abductors are  " local bigwigs belonging to the ruling pakistan people's party ,  who are now issuing threats to keep the dalit community silent "  ,  he said . 
kasturi's parents have paid a price for disregarding such threats and complaining to the police ,  he said ;  even the police are now harassing them . 
 " even though  ( rape )  is a nonbailable offence "  ,  veerjee said ,   " the local court granted bail to the accused "  . 
kasturi and her family had to flee their village because the suspects threatened them ,  he added . 
fed up with injustice and fearful for their safety ,  the fleeing dalit families  ( about <num>400</num>  individuals )  have abandoned the village of aakli and relocated to the plains near mithi ,  said hot chand toghani ,  a social activist with the thardeep rural development programme . 
the government is doing its best to protect the dalits ,  replied shaarjeel memon ,  a member of parliament representing tharparkar from the ruling party . 
 " the district government has been directed to establish houses for them and provide food and water "  ,  he told central asia online . 
we are trying to convince them to end their protest and return to their villages "  . 
 " no one can imagine how difficult it is to leave one's ancestral village "  ,  said <num>70</num> -year-old mehendero meghawar . 
 " but we've decided not to go back "  . 
dalits encounter discrimination from both muslims and higher-caste hindus ,  khangharani told central asia online . 
the dalits'  " untouchability "  bars them from accessing public places . 
 " neither hindu nor muslim barbers will shave dalits or give them a haircut "  ,  he said . 
 " hindus and muslims won't eat food prepared by the dalits ,  either . 
such practises concerning untouchability are very common in sindh "  . 
militants enjoy <num>3</num>  major pockets of support in pakistan
madrassas are accused of teaching extremist islam to hundreds of children . 
most of the children who attend madrassas - including this one in south punjab - are too poor to go to regular schools . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
islamabad - it might not be news that jihadists belonging to outlawed groups are operating in pakistan ,  but the degree to which its happening in south punjab might come as a surprise . 
south punjab is well-known for being home to a number of top militants such as maulana masood azhar  ( wanted by india )  ,  qari saifullah akhtar  ( who joined mullah omar in afghanistan in the <num>1990</num>  second  )  and others . 
with that as a backdrop ,  the punjab cabinet received intelligence reports in may that hinted at south punjab as a potential security menace . 
south punjab is not the only area of pakistan where the taliban has some support  ,  though . 
waziristan provides training facilities and the freedom to operate and collaborate . 
karachi is a major funding source . 
but south punjab is considered a human resource centre - its one of the talibans prime recruiting regions . 
my nephew disappeared from a madrassa in our village ,  said mukhtar ,  a resident of a bahawalpur village . 
his friend said he went on jihad after learning a violent version of islam . 
i could not afford to go look for him or to confront the powerful mullah who runs the madrassa . 
thats where blandishment comes in . 
the militancy sells dreams to the youth . 
our region is beyond economic strengthening ,  a young jihadist-in-training from bahawalpur said . 
our future is bleak ,  since were an economically and politically marginalised population whose youth see no life for themselves beyond the madrassa . 
we have no idea if it is the wrong or right path ,  but now we feel we can do something . 
according to a pakistan institute of peace studies report ,  more than <num>7,000</num>  of the <num>12,000</num>  registered seminaries in punjab are in south punjab . 
militants are using madrassa premises as hideouts and ammunition storage ,  said tariq parvez ,  head of the national counter-terrorism authority . 
he cited the case of a girls madrassa in the sahiwal district where authorities found ammunition stored . 
poverty ,  illiteracy ,  feudalism and staunch religiosity in south punjab make the atmosphere ripe for taliban recruitment ,  he said . 
existing poverty is reason enough to make this area potential ground for militants . 
poor parents give over their sons to madrassas . 
but pakistan is not standing idle while the taliban tries to exploit the countrys youth . 
the government has adopted a comprehensive policy to counter growing radicalisation in  ( south punjab )  madrassas <abbr>…</abbr>  by trying to effectively spread general education among the masses ,  parvez said . 
south punjab is one of the major ideological sanctuaries and a recruitment base of taliban and muslim extremists ,  said muhammad amir rana ,  head of the pakistan institute of policy studies ,  islamabad . 
but militants recruit youth from all over the country using the influence of these radical madrassas . 
sources claim that about <num>5,000</num> -<num>9,000</num>  youths from south punjab are fighting in afghanistan and waziristan . 
pakistani researcher hassan abbas figures <num>2,000</num>  youngsters are engaged in waziristan . 
that there would be training camps in south punjab similar to those in waziristan is quite plausible ,  abbas said . 
but we can say they have ideological camps here and that jihad is an essential part of their indoctrination . 
he offered a couple of recommendations for pakistan . 
we need effective policing at the punjab border with clear monitoring instead of any massive operation ,  he said . 
secondly ,  we need to engage the local political leadership in order to tackle the issue politically . 
for an effective operation ,  the need is to work on solid evidence ,  he said . 
making arrests or an apprehension of suspected elements and recovering weapons from them is not enough . 
a strategy at both the federal and provincial proper level is required to improve the situation . 
he suggested the government adopt a comprehensive policy to counter madrassa radicalisation by effectively spreading general education and awareness and introducing reforms in these areas . 
this requires a lot of financial investment "  ,  he said . 
the country has to decide if it is worth it . 
pakistan predicts modest agricultural growth
pakistani farmers harvest wheat in lahore this month . 
wheat production is expected to be around <num>24</num>  meter  tonnes this year ,  matching last years output . 
the agriculture sector should show modest growth overall . 
 [ arif ali / afp / getty images ] 
karachi -- the agriculture sector in pakistan is poised for modest growth in fy2009-10 ,  even though the country is facing a serious shortage of water and electricity ,  senior officials and experts told central asia online . 
in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  , agriculture growth is being predicted at <num>4.5</num>  %  against actual growth of <num>4.7</num>  %  in <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  , qadir bux baloch ,  agriculture development commissioner of the ministry of food and agriculture ,  told central asia online by phone from islamabad . 
such growth is considered modest but would eliminate the possibility of a food crisis in pakistan in <num>2010</num>  .
in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  , pakistan might miss targets it set for production of some major crops ,  because of an unprecedented water shortage ,  but overall output of cotton and rice is better than in fiscal <num>2009</num>  , baloch said . 
the country has produced <num>6.88</num>  meter  tonnes of rice so far in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  , exceeding the target of <num>6.1</num>  meter  tonnes . 
the federal committee on agriculture has a target of <num>14</num>  meter  bales of cotton in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  , but output is likelier to be <num>12.8</num>  meter  bales . 
that more modest expectation is still better than <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  production of <num>11.8</num>  meter  bales ,  he said . 
the constant water shortage thwarts achievement of cotton goals . 
baloch said pakistan will likely reap <num>24</num>  meter  tonnes of wheat in <num>2010</num>  , matching <num>2009</num>  production . 
the country can look forward to a surplus of <num>4</num>  meter  tonnes  ( including <num>1.5</num>  meter  tonnes left over from last year )  ,  which will enable it to store <num>2</num>  meter  tonnes and export another <num>2</num>  meter  tonnes ,  he said . 
the government will purchase more than <num>6</num>  meter  tonnes of wheat in <num>2010</num>  to ensure food security and a fair return to growers ,  he said . 
he said that ,  at the governments request ,  domestic banks have provided <num>20</num>  %  more credit to farmers ,  which led to modest growth in this sector . 
the ministry of food and agriculture has requested faster work on new dam and reservoir construction ,  he said . 
the ministry is also implementing a strategy to develop agriculture . 
it includes a crop maximisation programme being implemented in <num>1,000</num>  villages in phases and the provision of certified cotton ,  wheat and rice seeds and fertilisers at subsidised rates ,  he said . 
the cultivation of hybrid cotton and lining of waterways are also under way to enhance crop output and to reduce waste of irrigation water . 
poverty is one of the root causes of militancy in the remote areas of pakistan ,  said naeem ahmed ,  a senior international relations professor at karachi university . 
naeem ,  who is conducting research on the causes of militancy and ethnicity in the region ,  said the government should modernise agriculture . 
doing so would not only reduce poverty but would also provide economic opportunity to youth living in rural and remote areas ,  he said . 
agriculture has suffered a major setback in khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  he said . 
farmers have fled fertile lands to avoid militants . 
domestic banks are trying to help ,  baloch said . 
they have written off numerous loans to khyber pakhtunkhwa farmers ,  who have suffered millions of dollars in losses because of the militancy . 
the provinces hard-pressed farmers are receiving free fertiliser so they can resume agricultural activity ,  he said . 
lining waterways and construction of dams and reservoirs are essential to overcome the water shortage and strengthen agriculture on a long-term basis . 
for the past two decades ,  farmers faced perpetual water shortages as previous regimes failed to build reservoirs ,  he added . 
the government should extend technical and financial support to farmers in adopting modern technology to enhance crop yield ,  nizamani said . 
reconstruction takes top priority after military operations
construction workers rebuild a school in the swat districts dheri area . 
the military and government have made reconstructing schools damaged by taliban militants a top priority . 
rebuilding in social and other sectors will soon follow . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar -- a steady reconstruction to rebuild cities and aid the victims of islamic militancy is under way in khyber pakhtunkhwa province and the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  ,  officials and civil society members say . 
a damage and needs assessment report by the world bank and the asian development bank put the total cost of reconstruction of these areas at more than us <num>1</num>  $  billion . 
as an educator ,  it gives me immense pleasure to see damaged schools for boys in general and girls in particular being rebuilt after the forces defeated the taliban in my district ,  ziauddin yousafzai ,  a staunch anti-militancy voice ,  told central asia online by phone from mingora in swat valley . 
the military has attached great importance to rebuilding schools to shape a coalition of youth against islamic militancy . 
the taliban have destroyed some <num>800</num>  schools so far in khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
militants flattened <num>401</num>  schools ,  mostly for girls ,  in the swat district alone ,  and the damage and needs assessment report estimated the bill for school repairs in the province and the fata at us <num>401</num>  . 
we are on the right path ,  as all paperwork has been completed and some progress has already been made to undertake primary reconstruction in swat and other districts in malakand region ,  besides some tribal areas ,  shakil qadir ,  head of the provincial disaster management authority ,  told central asia online in peshawar . 
rebuilding the social sector -- including livelihood and social protection ,  housing ,  education and health -- in khyber pakhtunkhwa and the fata will require us <num>401</num>  ,  while restoring physical infrastructure -- including transport ,  water ,  sanitation and energy -- will cost us <num>401</num>  . 
a military officer ,  who requested anonymity ,  called reconstruction the most important post-operation phase . 
its successful execution impacts the results  ( of fighting the militancy )  ,  and any failure will have serious consequences for all of us . 
a number of observers agree . 
civil society members said that delaying reconstruction could alienate the public and reinvigorate the militancy . 
although numerous observers warn of the perils of delay ,  a funding problem has slowed the pace of reconstruction ,  yousafzai warned . 
the lack of funding has delayed compensation to those who suffered partial or complete damage to their houses during the militancy or the military operation against it . 
homeowners and other long-suffering residents hope the government keeps its word . 
the funding shortage will lead to uncertainty among the people ,  who suffered greatly during the last three years of militancy and destruction ,  ghulam farooq ,  a newspaper editor in mingora ,  told central asia online . 
khyber pakhtunkhwa police put lives on line in war on terror
peshawar city police chief liaqat ali  ( second from right )  and deputy chief karim khan  ( far right )  salute the coffin of deputy superintendent of police gulfat hussain ,  who was killed in a suicide attack april <num>19</num>  in peshawar . 
hussains son kashif is in the white shirt . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
peshawar - facing a suicide bomber when you know he can detonate his explosive vest at any time is not an easy job . 
a foreign journalist once rightly termed this situation the hug of death ,  said malik naveed ,  police chief of khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
he said police routinely face down terrorists to spare civilian casualties . 
only six hours after naveed discussed the sacrifices of his men with central asia online ,  a teenage suicide bomber entered the crowded qissa khwani bazaar and killed deputy superintendent of police gulfat hussain ,  his two bodyguards and <num>21</num>  other individuals . 
it is not known whether the police or those they were guarding were the targets . 
at least six blasts have occurred at the same market in the past three years . 
the first one - on january <num>27</num>  , <num>2007</num>  - killed then-city police chief malik saad ,  deputy superintendent of police khan raziq and more than a dozen others . 
on at least eight occasions ,  our policemen intercepted suicide bombers in peshawar alone during the last year so they would not succeed in hitting their target ,  said naveed ,  who added that low- and high-ranking police have sacrificed themselves . 
i feel proud of my cops who stand alert at vulnerable checkpoints to stop suicide bombers and explosive-laden vehicles even after intelligence reports say terrorists have broken into the city to hit their target ,  said liaqat ali khan ,  police chief of peshawar . 
this year ,  police chief of bannu district iqbal marwat ,  <num>33</num>  , was the first officer killed by a suicide bomber . 
he had just married . 
his widow is a first-year dental surgery student . 
he was a nice friend and a fine police officer ,  said mohammad sajjad khan ,  the current police chief of bannu and a friend of marwat . 
i will never forget the moments that i spent with iqbal . 
its not the money ,  but the sense of obligation to protect the public ,  that keeps the police loyal to their cause ,  some say . 
we get a meagre rs <num>13,000</num>   ( less than us <num>170</num>  $  )  monthly salary ,  said imran khan ,  <num>25</num>  , an officer at a remote badaber police post . 
but the thing that keeps us performing round the clock is the feeling of providing security to the over <num>3</num>  meter  people of peshawar . 
terrorists are not the only challenge for the police . 
we also have to perform duty for <num>24</num>  hours in sizzling summer days and chilling winter nights without basic facilities ,  imran said . 
you need a certain technique to better detect explosives in a car or attached to a human body ,  said ali ,  a constable who refused to give his last name . 
he said police at remote posts need concrete bunkers ,  rocket launchers and heavy weaponry to counter attackers from the nearby tribal areas . 
the provincial police chief ,  naveed ,  said the family receives a residential plot ,  rs <num>3</num>  meter   ( us <num>35,672</num>  $  )  ,  a job as an assistant sub-inspector ,  full salary until age <num>60</num>  and health care and education for the children of the dead policeman . 
first we had a <num>5</num>  %  quota for the sons of martyrs in the recruitment of assistant sub-inspectors ,  but now we have decided that first their children will be recruited while the remaining posts will be filled through merit ,  naveed said . 
pakistan moves back toward democracy
president asif ali zardari on april <num>19</num>  signs the 18t amendment bill . 
the constitutional amendment transfers power from the president to the parliament and the prime minister and renames the north west frontier province khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
 [ raheel khan ] 
islamabad - by signing the 18t amendment april <num>19</num>  , pakistani president asif ali zardari indicated that pakistan wants to move back toward democracy . 
among other things ,  the amendment transfers major powers from the president to the parliament and prime minister . 
the amendment passed both houses of parliament with a two-thirds majority . 
renaming the north west frontier province to khyber pakhtunkhwa is intended to increase the countrys stability . 
with the 18t amendment ,  the pakhtuns gained an identity for their land and geography in the form of khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  khan said . 
we understand the amendment will bring political stability and strengthened democracy to the country ,  as this amendment <abbr>…</abbr>  has been reached through consensus by all the major and regional political parties . 
pakistan needs political stability to withstand the onslaught of terrorism ,  he added . 
one clause offering more stability and reinforcing the power of parliament is that which deletes a constitution provisions which empowered the president to dismiss elected prime ministers and dissolve parliament . 
ali ahmed kurd ,  former president of the supreme court bar association of pakistan praised the amendment . 
the amendment says a judicial commission will appoint judges to superior courts ,  said kurd ,  who played a vital role in restoration of judges removed by musharraf in <num>2007</num>  .
the amendment also restores some of parliaments dignity and respect ,  he said . 
but the amendment lacks provisions for the war-torn federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  . 
tribal residents of fata were disappointed not to receive any assistance ,  farhad shinwari ,  a fata journalist ,  told central asia online . 
one member of the national assembly from fata belonged to the constitutional reform committee ,  but he failed to deliver ,  shinwari said . 
the people of fata want reforms in the frontier crime regulations ,  which is a special law under which fata is governed through the political agent . 
it is the long-standing demand of the tribal people ,  as they want to be governed like any other civilised citizens . 
with the amendment passed ,  the public now wants the government to address social problems . 
pakhtunkhwa ,  in particular ,  needs assistance according to arif khan ,  an international relations scholar from the region . 
now the government must pay attention to the security problems in the country ,  particularly in pakhtunkhwa ,  he said . 
bomb blasts are a routine ;  people are dying like anything . 
their lives should be secured by investing more in security institutions and capacity-building ,  and terrorism victims should be compensated on time . 
i think this should be done by the federal government ,  as the provincial government doesnt have enough resources . 
the 18t amendment is a step in the right direction ,  he said ,  but more must be done . 
when security problems are addressed ,  there will be local and foreign investment ,  which can improve the economy and generate employment ,  he said . 
now we have a more powerful parliament . 
we expect it to make bold decisions to overcome the energy crisis and alleviate poverty ,  as there are no excuses any more about dictatorship "  . 
peshawar -- a long-awaited moment finally came for the pakhtun nation in pakistan when the national parliament agreed april <num>8</num>  to rename the north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  to khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
the move ,  which came with ratification of the 18t amendment ,  gave pakhtuns what many of their leaders called identity . 
young and old alike danced to a drumbeat at the peshawar sports complex ,  while others exulted on the streets . 
it  ( renaming the province )  has made me feel younger ,  <num>83</num> -year-old pakhtun nationalist leader afzal khan lala told central asia online before leaving for kabul at the invitation of afghan president hamid karzai . 
lala became a symbol of resistance against the taliban in swat after he stayed to defy militants trying to impose their stricter version of islam . 
the pakhtuns are the second biggest source of manpower in the army after punjab and have become a valuable source of foreign exchange by working abroad . 
millions of pakhtuns have been forced to seek work far away ,  since militancy and the decades-old conflict in neighbouring afghanistan disrupted life in khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
the renaming of the former nwfp caps a decades-long struggle for the ruling pakhtun nationalist awami national party . 
pro-establishment right-wing political forces in the country always opposed the renaming . 
in the end ,  every major political and religious group in parliament - except the pro-pervez musharraf pakistan muslim league-quaid  ( pml-q )  -backed the renaming of the province ,  where pakhtuns constitute <num>73.9</num>  %  of the population . 
the pakhtun nation ,  meanwhile ,  is battling the worst security crisis in its history as it confronts an islamic militancy that has engulfed its lands . 
taliban- and al-qaeda-linked militants have killed hundreds of thousands of civilians ,  police officers and troops with bombs and suicide attacks . 
the old ,  strictly geographic name of the province gave the pakhtuns an identity crisis and hindered them from confronting the taliban ,  scholars and politicians say . 
in the absence of identity ,  a nation cannot progress and that is what has happened to the pakhtun nation ,  khalid aziz ,  former chief secretary of khyber pakhtunkhwa and now chief of a think tank ,  told central asia online . 
identity gives you strength and respect <abbr>…</abbr>  and that is enough to face the taliban with greater determination and resolve ,  he responded to a question about identity . 
afghan girls study at an open-air school in this file photo . 
dozens of schoolgirls fell ill april <num>25</num>  and <num>26</num>  in afghanistans kunduz province . 
officials and parents accuse taliban militants of poisoning the girls . 
 [ paula bronstein / getty images ] 
kabul - parents ,  officials and other parts of afghan society are terming the outbreak of alleged poisonings afflicting schoolgirls brutal and unacceptable . 
more than <num>80</num>  girls attending khadijatul kubra and fatima high schools in kunduz suffered inexplicable illnesses april <num>25</num>  and <num>26</num>  , province officials said . 
authorities suspect insurgents of poisoning food and water inside the schools and contaminating some classrooms with toxic gases overnight ,  media reported . 
kunduz is in the relatively secure northern zone of afghanistan ,  but insurgents are active in many districts there . 
provincial officials and many residents blame the taliban for the girls illnesses ,  even though the talibans official spokesman denied any involvement . 
government authorities are trying to ascertain whether and how the girls were poisoned . 
and they have carried out this poisoning attack just to create panic and problems . 
angry teachers and parents blamed the taliban . 
he told central asia online his daughter survived the attack ;  however ,  it made him worry for her future . 
i dont know what to do ,  he said . 
i want her to study ,  but our enemies dont want us or this country to progress . 
if the schools are so insecure and if the innocent children are targeted just because they want education ,  we are left with no choice but to sit home and mourn our luck . 
many schools in the province have temporarily closed and parents are fearful of sending their children to class ,  authorities and local citizens said . 
during its rule of afghanistan from <num>1995</num> -<num>2001</num>  , the taliban prohibited females from being educated . 
hamid karzais government reopened girls schools when it came to power in <num>2001</num>  .
women flocked back to economic and social life after years of confinement to their homes . 
however ,  the taliban ,  resurgent starting in <num>2004</num>  , are trying to reverse that . 
in november <num>2008</num>  , taliban loyalists threw acid on the faces of numerous schoolgirls in kandahar province . 
police arrested ten men who said they had links to militants and had been paid to attack the girls . 
provincial name change comes at a cost
with the renaming of the north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  to khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  vehicle owners have to replace their old plates . 
motorists will have to order new number plates with the khyber pakhtunkhwa name instead of the previous name ,  nwfp ,  sabir ,  who has years of experience stamping out licence plates for vehicles ,  told central asia online from his showroom in saddar bazaar . 
i think we can make all these changes without heavy expenses if we stay calm and are not in a hurry ,  rustam shah mohmand ,  former chief secretary of the old nwfp ,  told central asia online . 
there is no need to make these changes immediately . 
what is more important for the government is to spend more on <abbr>…</abbr>  essential services to the people . 
one proposal is to apply stickers to old stationery until the supply runs out ,  he said . 
we hope we will not spend that big an amount ,  he said . 
the provincial government was quick to drop the old provincial name from its website ,  which cost next to nothing . 
however ,  urls and the texts of websites still have nwfp or its variants embedded in them ,  as do web links to various government departments . 
the coalition government will take steps to prevent excessive spending on the name change ,  khyber pakhtunkhwa government spokesman mian iftikhar hussain said . 
but we are not doing this . 
we will use stickers and stamps <abbr>…</abbr>  with the provinces new name . 
the government would rather devote that money to other development purposes ,  he said . 
re-talibanisation termed impossible in swat
islamabad -the scenic swat valley is firmly under the authorities control ,  said maj gen athar abbas ,  director general inter services public relations and chief spokesman of the pakistani army . 
he dismissed reports that taliban militants were re-emerging in swat . 
its unthinkable that taliban militants will reassert themselves in swat . 
recent bombings and suicide attacks in the swat capital ,  mingora ,  and assassinations of peace committee members have led to media stories questioning the extent of military control . 
these are sporadic individual acts aimed at creating fear and panic among the general public ,  abbas said ,  referring to recent suicide blasts in mingora . 
security forces are on high alert in the entire valley . 
it is impossible for militants to carry out their activities in big groups ,  he said . 
recent assassinations of local leaders and peace jirga representatives in the towns of kanju ,  charbagh and kabal have alarmed the population . 
the bombs and suicide attacks and targeted killing created great fear among the people in the entire swat valley ,  niaz ahmad ,  a journalist in mingora ,  told central asia online . 
the terrorism signified to locals that taliban remnants are still freely operating in the valley ,  he said . 
that makes it difficult to predict how long it will take to finish off the insurgency in the valley ,  he added . 
there can be one or two such incidents happening here and there ,  which does not mean militants are becoming powerful ,  abbas told central asia online . 
security forces are providing more personal security for political and civil society leaders to thwart further assassinations ,  he said . 
after that operation ,  the military declared the area militant-free and allowed hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons to return to their homes . 
abbas expressed appreciation for the continued co-operation of local residents with security forces in hunting down taliban stragglers . 
illegal fm radio broadcasts ,  friday sermons held responsible for militancy in swat
illegal fm radio stations ,  illiteracy ,  misuse of religion and the governance system have aided the rise of islamic militancy in the swat region ,  according to a new study . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar -- illegal fm radio stations ,  illiteracy ,  religion and the governance system introduced in <num>2001</num>  have aided the growth of islamic militancy in the swat valley ,  according to a survey released may <num>14</num>  .
the survey found that only <num>9</num>  %  of swat residents were satisfied with the militants rule from <num>2007</num> -<num>09</num>  .
conversely ,  <num>90</num>  %  expressed dissatisfaction with the militants policies ,  including public floggings and executions ,  and bans on girls education ,  tv and cinema . 
pollsters conducted the survey in february and march . 
they gathered responses from <num>384</num>  randomly selected households across <num>16</num>  union councils in the district . 
it covers numerous causes of conflict and provides comprehensive coverage of subjects ,  including :  strategic communication ,  social customs ,  development ,  foreign intervention ,  governance ,  security ,  religion and poverty . 
a vast majority - <num>70</num>  %  - of swat residents said the afghan taliban supports swat militants ,  while some cited foreign intervention as a cause for the militancys spread . 
some <num>56</num>  %  of respondents said the local government system introduced in <num>2001</num>  to replace the british era system also facilitated the militancy ,  while <num>22</num>  %  disagreed . 
the survey found widespread support for the notion that a previous provincial government of mutatahida majlis-e-amal  ( mma )  - <num>2002</num> -<num>08</num>  - in peshawar was casual in its handlings of acts of terrorism . 
while <num>82</num>  %  of respondents said the mma government did not fight the militancy effectively between <num>2002</num>  and <num>2008</num>  , <num>11</num>  %  said government had effective fought the militancy . 
the survey found a close nexus between the afghan refugees and insurgents when insurgents used mosque pulpits to preach against the state and encourage participation in jihad . 
it also found that a very high percentage of the population predicted that another round of fighting will ensue after the army leaves swat . 
eighty-five percent of respondents pointed to a link between poor socio-economic status and the militancy ,  while <num>75</num>  %  of respondents said unemployment drives youth into militancy . 
sixty-seven percent said there was a close connection between religious education and militancy ,  referring to the growth of madrassas that teach hatred of non-muslims . 
the survey found respondents largely agreeing that madrassa students were more prone to militancy than others . 
some <num>84</num>  %  of respondents subscribed to the  ( view )  that madrassa students  ( commonly known as taliban )  are more prone to militancy ,  the survey said . 
uzbek militants active in tribal areas
pakistani military and paramilitary officers pray march <num>26</num>  at the peshawar funeral of an army officer who died fighting militants . 
military operations in south waziristan have pushed uzbek militants to the tribal areas . 
islamabad - members of the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  ,  along with arab and chechen militants ,  are active in parts of the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  of pakistan ,  a top military spokesman said . 
military operations in south waziristan might have pushed the militants - whose numbers range from <num>500</num>  to <num>2,000</num>  - into orakzai agency . 
now  ( uzbek militants )  mostly are stationed in north waziristan and have spread to orakzai and other tribal areas ,  rahimullah yusufzai ,  a journalist and analyst ,  told central asia online . 
they are under great  ( military )  pressure <abbr>…</abbr>  but they dont have any choice . 
they cant go anywhere else as the central asian states are not going to accept them . 
the imus prime objective is to establish an islamic state in uzbekistan ,  he said . 
the tehreek-e-taliban  ( ttp )  and al-qaeda gave them active support and hosted them . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  in return they have to fight alongside ttp militants ,  yusufzai said . 
these uzbek militants are contributing to the <abbr>…</abbr>  activities of the ttp in pakistan . 
army spokesman maj gen ather abbas said ,  uzbek militants were quite active and resisted pakistani forces in the kaniguram area of south waziristan . 
after the military took control of the area ,  some fled to afghanistan and bajaur ,  but mirali of north waziristan is their epicentre ,  abbas said . 
uzbek militants use guerrilla warfare tactics ,  a local resident told central asia online on condition of anonymity . 
they provide the core human resources for suicide bombings . 
their prime targets have been security forces ,  the source said . 
most people believe the imu recruits boys from central asia ,  then brainwashes them into becoming suicide bombers ,  the source continued . 
the uzbeks seems to be well-funded ,  too . 
they  ( wear )  pants and shirts ,  which are alien to the local culture . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  they eat canned food ,  which comes from outside ,  the source said . 
someone must be bringing these edibles from outside -- maybe peshawar ,  karachi and afghanistan . 
they live lavishly ,  to which interestingly the local tribes have not reacted so far . 
they have established an image as fighters for islam who left behind their homes and wealth . 
people respect them for this ,  the source said . 
but contrary to this image ,  their moral values do not conform to islam and fall below those of the tribes . 
dr sarfaraz khan ,  director of the area study centre at the university of peshawar ,  provided some context for the uzbeks being in pakistan . 
 ( they )  came to afghanistan and then shifted to pakistans tribal areas after the taliban government was defeated in <num>2001</num>  "  ,  khan said . 
 " tahir yaldashev is their leader . 
he has been reported wounded a number of times but is still at large "  . 
if someone comes from soviet-era uzbekistan ,  he has been trained in warfare because he had to serve two years in the soviet army ,  khan said . 
 " military operations might weaken them ,  but they are there "  . 
 " uzbek militants along with chechens ,  turkmen and arabs have been masquerading as students in madrassas in different parts of the country ,  including in southern punjab "  ,  khan said . 
 " they are believed either to be giving or receiving training . 
anybody who wants to compound pakistan's terror and chaos can sponsor them . 
this is alarming "  . 
the recent progress of government forces against foreign fighters reportedly has tightened the noose around the imu and other militants ,  but eliminating a problem that has plagued successive governments in pakistan will require unflagging commitment and extensive resources ,  analysts said . 
hepatitis hits pakistan hard
pakistani doctors and paramedics observe world hepatitis day in karachi may <num>19</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
the ailment is spreading nationwide at an alarming rate . 
 [ rizwan tabassum / afp / getty images ] 
peshawar - gravediggers in the par hoti area in khyber pakhtunkhwa murmur about whom they will bury next . 
only last week ,  we buried ajmal hussain ,  whose father died a month ago from hepatitis c ,  sanaullah ,  one of the gravediggers ,  told central asia online over the weekend . 
today we buried  ( the son )  after he battled hepatitis c for four months . 
estimates of the diseases prevalence vary . 
dr shershah syed ,  president of the pakistan medical association ,  estimated that <num>15.6</num>  %  of the population carries the virus . 
about <num>3</num>  meter  who visited public sector hospitals per year have hepatitis b or c or both . 
the number might be catastrophic if the entire population were screened ,  he said . 
a few years ago ,  a little more than <num>11</num>  %  carried the disease ,  he said . 
hepatologist prof najibul haq estimated that about <num>10</num>  %  of the population carries hepatitis b and that more pakistanis could carry hepatitis <abbr>c.</abbr> 
by comparison ,  the national hepatitis programme estimates that hepatitis b and hepatitis c infect <num>3</num> -<num>4</num>  %  and <num>5</num> -<num>6</num>  %  of pakistanis ,  respectively . 
whatever the numbers ,  doctors call hepatitis the aids of pakistan and plead for measures to curtail the disease . 
pakistan is becoming a cirrhotic state ,  said dr fayyaz ali ,  a public health analyst at the directorate of health in peshawar . 
however ,  the absence of government-sponsored activities in khyber pakhtunkhwa on world hepatitis day ,  may <num>19</num>  , was striking . 
no conferences ,  parades or educational activities took place ,  even as numerous governments worldwide marked the day . 
silence about the causes of hepatitis can be deadly . 
two years ago ,  a world health organisation  ( who )  study revealed that <num>30</num>  %  of hepatitis b and c cases follow the reuse of syringes by unqualified medical practitioners . 
officials and doctors cant stop the cheap-syringe mafia . 
we arrested many people red-handed who were recycling and packaging substandard syringes without sterilising them ,  one health official ,  who asked to remain anonymous ,  said at a seminar . 
we reported it to higher-ups ,  but <abbr>…</abbr>  i was shown the door . 
hepatitis is transmitted through transfusions of unscreened blood ,  said who operations medical officer dr saeed akbar khan . 
un-sterilised medical equipment ,  ear and nose piercing ,  careless shaving in barbershops and unsafe sex spread the disease too . 
symptoms include weakness ,  lethargy ,  aches ,  low-grade fever ,  loss of appetite ,  and dark yellow urine ,  najibul said . 
but patients have bigger problems :  cirrhosis ,  bloody vomiting and liver cancer . 
hepatitis is the most common cause of liver cancer in pakistan ,  as in many countries . 
we have so far treated only <num>22,000</num>  patients free of charge ,  dr rashid juma ,  director general health islamabad ,  told central asia online . 
officials also are installing water filtration plants in hospitals to provide clean drinking water . 
the only option to keep the disease away is prevention ,  he stressed . 
another challenge is that the government has not fully implemented the safe blood transfusion ordinance ,  introduced in <num>2002</num>  , fayyaz said . 
the ordinance calls for a five-member safe blood authority to ensure professional blood bank management in accordance with who guidelines . 
but the authority hasnt come into existence yet .

khyber agency - jubilant youngsters from the troubled darra adam khel tribal region screamed in joy and waved their fists in the air when they were declared winners of the all-fata ( federally administered tribal areas )  youth sports gala at qayyum stadium in peshawar at the end of a week-long sports festival . 
yasir afridi ,  captain of the winning team ,  told central asia online such sporting events could bring about positive changes in the behaviour and thinking of tribal youth . 
if such events are organised on regular basis ,  we can overcome the menace of militancy in our region and infuse new sporting spirit into the tribal youth ,  he said while his teammates danced to the tune of atanr . 
teammates cheered ,  whistled and screamed in joy when group leaders were given trophies and certificates at the concluding ceremony . 
the scene was a clear departure from the recent gloomy past in most of the tribal areas ,  where many educational institutions were closed and strict restrictions were imposed on all sorts of cultural activities . 
the difference is clear ,  said wazir khan ,  head of an educational institution in darra adam khel . 
students have clearly drawn the line … saying no to militancy and yes to the revival of healthy activities ,  he said with a big smile on his face . 
such type of activities would surely desist our tribal youth from becoming suicide bombers ,  he said ,  referring to taliban tactics of employing teen-age tribesmen as suicide bombers . 
it was barely a year ago that darra adam khel ,  a semi-tribal region <num>25</num>  kilometer  south of peshawar ,  was a taliban stronghold . 
the darra taliban enforced its brand of islamic justice mercilessly ,  executing opponents in public ,  destroying government facilities and targeting tribal peace committees . 
before that ,  it was impossible to pass through and not see a cricket match being played under the lengthening shadows of the surrounding hills . 
the military operation against militants paved the way for a return of all sorts of social ,  cultural and sporting events . 
it was against this backdrop in the fata that its sports directorate arranged a week-long sporting gala for students in these regions . 
director of sports fata faisal jamil said he hoped healthy activities could prevent tribal youth from falling into wrong hands . 
nobody can deny the positive and healthy effects of sports upon the minds of youth ,  and i am <num>100</num>  %  confident that tribal youth would abhor terrorism in all its forms if such events are organised on regular basis throughout fata ,  he said . 
munir orakzai ,  the fata parliamentary leader ,  in the national assembly ,  called upon the international community to assist tribal youth in polishing their sporting skills and becoming law-abiding citizens . 
apart from enhancing their physical strength ,  sports also inculcate discipline among the young lot ,  he said . 
proving these words true ,  the fata under-13 football team was runner-up in the recently concluded nation under-13 football championship in lahore . 
the underdog fata juveniles were pitted against well-trained teams from punjab ,  sindh ,  khyber-pakhtunkhwa ,  baluchistan ,  army and islamabad . 
cricket is popular all across the tribal belt . 
pitches ,  levelled by the tribesmen in their own crude fashion ,  can be found in the tribal areas in dry riverbeds ,  in the woods and in the inaccessible mountains . 
thus ,  the fata cricket association organised three sporting events in khyber ,  bajaur and mardan . 
indeed imran khan ,  former captain of the national team ,  always advocated a talent hunt from these rugged areas . 
nasir believes that tribesmen could be found to be most favourable inclined to be part of global village ,  and that sports can help accomplish that . 
all that they lack is exposure ,  access and patronage . 
they have for long been labelled as one thing or the other … its time now to engage the tribal youth in constructive pursuits ,  he said .

pakistan will present its <num>2010</num> -<num>11</num>  budget in the assembly june <num>5</num>  .

islamabad -- pakistans <num>2010</num> -<num>11</num>  budget ,  due to be announced june <num>5</num>  , could hit the poor hard as the pakistan peoples party  ( ppp ) -led coalition government proposes to end its subsidy regime . 
the proposal also would increase pakistans defence budget <num>17</num>  %  for <num>2010</num> -<num>11</num>  from rs <num>378</num>  billion to rs <num>442</num>  billion . 
the government is allocating rs <num>110</num>  billion for security-related operations and rs <num>25</num>  billion for internally displaced persons . 
but much focus has centred on the subsidys elimination . 
abolition of the subsidy of the gst on electricity would mean a considerable increase in power costs for all pakistani consumers from july <num>1</num>  , said dr abid suleri ,  executive director of the sustainable development policy institute . 
one thing that is going to make the upcoming annual budget different from the previous ones is that the government is bound to implement commitments ,  such as abolition of the subsidy on electricity ,  given to the international monetary fund  ( imf )  for getting a <num>11.3</num>  $  billion loan under a standby arrangement ,  he said . 
the imf has pressed pakistan to reform its electricity billing system and end the subsidies . 
another major change in pakistans annual budget is implementation of a controversial value-added tax  ( vat )  beginning july <num>1</num>  and other new tax measures to achieve the ambitious revenue target of rs <num>1.7</num>  billion . 
the vat is controversial in pakistan . 
three provinces - sindh ,  khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab - are not ready to accept this new tax . 
their chief ministers told prime minister yousuf raza gilani recently that the vat is not acceptable to them . 
they foresee it as a further burden on taxpayers that might trigger strong protest . 
however ,  the government is dependent on imf loans and sees no other option but to implement the vat from july <num>1</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
as a policy decision ,  the vat will be introduced from july <num>1</num>  … and new measures will also be taken to achieve rs <num>1,700</num>  tax revenue  ( for the federal bureau of revenue )  ,  the budget document said . 
the vat will help the government substantially increase revenue and have more resources for development ,  said nazar gondal ,  federal minister for food and agriculture . 
i have no doubt that the vat is the only tool available to the government to bring all those who earn money into the tax net ,  gondal said . 
the government has set public sector development programme  ( psdp )  spending for <num>2010</num> -<num>11</num>  at rs <num>663</num>  billion . 
the major share of financial resources  ( rs <num>136</num>  billion )  allocated for psdp <num>2010</num> -<num>11</num>  is allocated for infrastructure . 
the social sector will get rs <num>124</num>  billion ,  and transportation and communication will receive rs <num>70</num>  billion . 
the psdp allocation also includes rs <num>35.4</num>  billion for water-related projects ,  including rs <num>15</num>  billion for land acquisition for the crucial diamer-basha dam . 
the psdp can make a difference as far as development is concerned only when it has a strong evaluation and monitoring system to prevent waste of public funds ,  he said . 
i recommend that the decision-makers bring in experts and professionals for making psdp and other policy work result-oriented ,  he said . 
pakistani police fight terrorism on tight budget
a policeman searches pedestrians in lahore . 
police in major cities have launched body and vehicle searches to catch terrorists before they can strike . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
islamabad - a lack of resources has never stopped pakistani police from fighting terrorism . 
i am not afraid of death ,  but a fear looming before me is how my family will survive when i die ,  ramzan ,  an islamabad police constable ,  told central asia online ,  his voice laced with emotion . 
the salary of a constable is around us <num>118</num>  $  a month - a sum hardly sufficient to feed a family - and ramzan generally works <num>16</num> -hour days . 
its a danger once restricted to the tribal regions . 
however ,  since military operations against the taliban began in the tribal belt ,  islamist insurgents have focused on urban centres ,  trying to instil panic by striking government and civilian targets . 
this is putting another group of police officers and the public at risk . 
but efforts are under way to diminish the danger for police and the public and to care for slain officers families . 
we are taking safety measures for citizens and have captured explosive-laden vehicles and suicide bombers ,  which are triumphs against terrorists ,  syed kaleem imam ,  inspector general of police ,  islamabad ,  told central asia online . 
islamabad police are teaching the public how to recognize terrorists by releasing a report on the behavioural pattern of suicide attackers ,  he said . 
a suicide bomber typically is a young man between <num>18</num>  and <num>25</num>  years ,  with a plump look from wearing an explosive jacket . 
 ( he may be )  wearing new clothes and new shoes ,  have trimmed his hair and beard ,  and be fasting and reciting . 
the handler of suicide bombers points out the target only <num>10</num>  to <num>15</num>  minutes prior to accomplish the task ,  the report says . 
police have disbursed such information to police officers ,  security guards ,  watchmen ,  students and personnel of various organisations in their jurisdiction . 
people should convey information after sensing any dubious activity or element ,  imam said as he urged the public to co-operate with police in combating terrorism . 
the public should be sharply attentive and alert and hit the suicide attacker before he hits his target . 
police have used what money they have to buy equipment to forestall terrorism . 
mobile forensic labs ,  criminal sketch software ,  criminal index card software and the national database and registration authority network are being used now . 
random vehicle searches ,  once reserved for cities ,  are occurring in rural areas ,  too ,  where mounted police have begun patrolling ,  said the spokesman of the deputy commissioner ,  islamabad . 
in addition ,  the government is trying to provide for families of fallen police officers . 
the pakistan bait-ul-mal and ministry of interior announced the establishment of the national shuhada childrens trust to enable children of police officers slain by bomb blasts to attend the best educational facilities ,  said an interior ministry spokesman ,  who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
this addresses part of constable ramzans concern as to how his family will fare should he die in the line of duty . 
the trust will provide free education ,  residences and medical facilities to the children of all the police officials who sacrificed their lives for their country and who fell victim to terrorist attacks ,  the official said . 
children of martyrs can apply for assistance from the nsct on prescribed  ( forms )  to the national crisis management cell . 
interior minister rehman malik has called for the establishment of a fully equipped educational centre in islamabad ,  followed by similar projects in all the provinces . 
authorities will extend the programme to the provincial capitals of gilgit and azad kashmir ,  a ministry spokesman said . 
under the guidelines ,  children  ( ages <num>4</num> -<num>10</num>  )  of police officers slain in terrorist attacks would be eligible for the programme . 
we are in a war ,  and now its our collective responsibility to help victims families ,  said rana sana ullah ,  minister of law ,  punjab . 
the punjab government announced an increase in the police victims fund from <num>23,949</num>  $  to <num>359,712</num>  $  , scholarships for children to meet their educational expenses and jobs for police officers survivors so that they can run their lives in the proper manner ,  he said . 
since april <num>2009</num>  , fallen police officers children have received free education from primary to postgraduate level ,  and all expenses in this context are being shouldered by the punjab government .

khyber agency -- the weakening of taliban groups in the tribal belt and elsewhere after military operations has encouraged rival militant groups to attack them . 
pakistani officials have confirmed the deaths of a total of <num>25</num>  militants during a clash between the lashkar-e-islam  ( li )  and tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  june <num>6</num>  in khyber agency . 
the dead included two important local commanders of the banned li militant organisation . 
such clashes make the job of security forces easier in tribal areas ,  a government official said on condition of anonymity . 
we are in pursuit of militants from either side as part of our national strategy of war against terrorism … and when they fight each other ,  then we simply watch from a distance . 
the pakistani military has sporadically bombed militant hide-outs in the region during the past month and a half ,  killing some <num>40</num>  militants . 
li established illegal bases there after government troops expelled it from most parts of the bara subdivision during a military operation last september . 
the li had earlier established its own courts and private jails while challenging the governments writ in all of bara . 
zardad afridi ,  a local resident who keeps an eye on the area ,  told central asia online that li cannot tolerate the existence of rival groups in areas under its control ;  thus the ttp-li clashes were imminent . 
he insisted ,  however ,  that it would take a full-fledged military operation to cleanse the area of militant groups . 
there is always danger of harm to civilians when such clashes between rival militant groups occur in tribal areas ,  afridi said . 
the bloody clashes between the taliban and li resulted from recent military successes against the taliban in south waziristan and orakzai tribal regions ,  security analysts said . 
smaller or splinter groups are now challenging the authority of ttp since its on the run from swat ,  bajaur ,  waziristan and orakzai ,  said ayaz wazir ,  a former diplomat . 
ttp incurred the wrath of the local population by demonstrating a barbaric attitude and thus faced challenges from smaller groups ,  said malak gulzada ,  a tribal elder from khyber agency . 
but li is … no lesser evil . 
punjabi taliban become more active in pakistan

punjab law minister rana sanaullah said the punjabi taliban were involved in the violence . 
 [ arif ali / afp / getty images ] 
lahore - after brutal attacks on police and minority qadyani worship places in lahore in late may ,  authorities in pakistan have acknowledged the active presence of the punjabi taliban . 
the outcome of the recent attacks on qadyani  ( ahmadi )  worship places in lahore is that for the first time ,  the provincial government of punjab and federal government have concluded that punjabi taliban are no more a myth ,  but a reality ,  senior journalist mubashir bukhari told central asia online . 
this is not only a small group but has many terrorists and a good organisational network throughout punjab . 
punjabi law minister rana sanaullah confirmed that punjabi taliban were involved . 
two terrorists were arrested from model town and revealed that they were trained in north waziristan agency ,  sanaullah told news media . 
terrorists came from bannu ,  reached lahore may <num>21</num>  , and stayed in different madrassas in and around lahore for six days . 
two terrorists arrested in model town were from the rahimyar khan district of punjab and the swat district of khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  intelligence sources said . 
those arrested were identified as muaaz and abdullah ,  who were associated with the badar mansoor group of the taliban . 
badar mansoor was the commander of harkat ul-mujahideen  ( a banned jihadist outfit )  ,  that used to fight in indian-controlled kashmir . 
however ,  after its banning ,  this group split ,  and  ( some members )  found their way into taliban ranks ,  an intelligence report said . 
badar mansoor is from punjab ;  he is the mastermind of attacks in punjab and he trains punjabi taliban for attacks ,  the same report said . 
muaaz said he was shown caricatures of prophet muhammad  ( peace be upon him )  and asked to attack qadyanis ,  said dr javed akram of jinnah hospital lahore . 
qadyanis or ahmadis have been declared a non-muslim minority in pakistan since <num>1974</num>  .
this is not the first time that minorities have been attacked ,  but its the first time that the taliban hit minorities ,  bukhari said . 
attackers killed five qadyanis in punjabs narowal district in october <num>2000</num>  , <num>18</num>  christians in a bahawalpur church in <num>2001</num>  and six others in the christian school muree near islamabad in august <num>2002</num>  .
another eight qadyanis were killed in mandi bahauddin in november <num>2004</num>  , while seven christians were killed in gojra in august <num>2009</num>  .
these are major ,  deadly incidents ,  but there have been a number of attacks on minorities in kasur ,  rahimyar khan ,  bahawalnagar ,  texla and in other areas of punjab ,  leaving many injured ,  bukhari told central asia online . 
federal interior minister rehman malik ,  probably keeping in view the talibans involvement in attacks on minorities ,  considers a military operation in south punjab essential ,  bukhari said . 
however ,  he might not want to risk differences with the pakistan muslim league-n-led government in punjab and has softened his stance regarding a military operation . 
the punjab government supports a search operation but calls a military operation like those in swat and the federally administered tribal areas impossible . 
we dont think that a military operation is a must in south punjab for eliminating the punjabi taliban ,  sanaullah said . 
jihadi newspapers are readily available throughout pakistan . 
sindh home minister zulfiqar mirza directed authorities to stop the sale and distribution of inflammatory literature and audio cassettes . 
 [ zia ur rehman ] 
karachi -- school curricula ,  mainstream media ,  sectarian speeches and easy access to jihadi literature and websites are key to the radicalisation of pakistani youth ,  analysts say . 
at least three generations of pakistanis have grown up intoxicated on a curriculum and literature of hatred ,  bigotry ,  militancy ,  sectarianism ,  dogmatism and fanaticism ,  said akhter hussain baloch ,  former co-ordinator of the human rights commission of pakistan  ( hrcp )  . 
the school system fostered a cadre of religiously conservative youth by applying a narrow ,  politicised definition of islam to build pakistani patriotism that continues to poison the nations youth ,  he said . 
the textbooks authored and altered during the <num>11</num>  years of general zia ul-haqs military rule are still used in schools ,  baloch said . 
such textbooks incited militancy and violence ,  including the encouragement of jihad and shahadat ,  glorified war <abbr>…</abbr>  and spread hateful stereotypes of non-muslims ,  he added . 
the sdpi commissioned <num>30</num>  scholars to analyse an array of textbooks used in primary and secondary schools . 
now religion is to be taught in focused courses ,  rather than being infused into social studies ,  civics ,  urdu and english . 
the government is preparing a revision of curricula that are being unveiled this year . 
if there is any objectionable content ,  it will surely be removed ,  an anonymous ministry of education official in sindh said . 
the mainstream media have been criticised by some analysts ,  who say they contribute to radicalising youth when they present taliban militants as heroes in articles . 
the media are building up the atmosphere of distrust and hype ,  amin khattak ,  secretary-general of the awami national party sindh ,  told central asia online . 
if you read pakistans newspapers or watch tv news ,  you will find phony news items --like those saying that the cia is recruiting locals through blackwater -- are behind all the terrorist activities carried out nationwide ,  and will seize the countrys nuclear assets if pakistan collapses ,  khattak said . 
one provincial government trying to stem the tide is in sindh . 
provincial home minister zulfiqar mirza banned the sale or distribution of objectionable or provocative literature and audio cassettes and ordered police to monitor banned groups activities ,  the sindh government said in a statement . 
observers attribute the action to pressure resulting from recent terrorist attacks in lahore on the ahmadi community . 
a government ban on jihadi literature is not stopping jihadi and sectarian organisations from their work . 
they simply change the names of their publications ,  elahi said . 
hate literature and jihadi newspapers are not as easily available as they once were in karachi ,  but they can be obtained through certain mosques and book stalls or members of the appropriate group ,  baloch said . 
those publications run ads that raise money for their causes ,  he warned . 
religio-political parties ,  especially their student wings ,  are exploiting the anti-western sentiments of youth in academic institutions ,  said ali raza ,  a student leader at the university of karachi . 
he said he knows a few students from well-heeled karachi families who joined the taliban and died battling the army in the tribal areas . 
to some extent ,  young pakistanis are influenced by jihadi literature circulating on various islamist websites and discussion forums ,  and the militants use of the internet for <abbr>…</abbr>  recruitment and public relations has been well demonstrated ,  a security analyst said on condition of anonymity . 
more than half of pakistans population is under the age of <num>30</num>  .
ironically ,  alvi became a victim of violence after the news conference :  religious anti-facebook demonstrators attacked him outside the press club .

 [ rizwan tabassum / afp / getty images ] 
karachi -- sindh police launched a crackdown june <num>15</num>  against terrorists and banned organisations in karachi ,  sindh home minister dr zulfiqar mirza told central asia online . 
officials of the crimes investigation department of sindh police are co-operating in the effort . 
police would initially round up <num>175</num>  suspected hard-line terrorists who had recently been released from prison and who are thought to still be involved in terrorism and targeted killings in karachi ,  mirza said . 
the federal government will not tolerate terrorism and target killings ,  interior minister rehman malik told central asia online . 
president asif zardari ordered the crackdown . 
the government suspects that terrorists from banned organizations might have been involved in a series of targeted killings in karachi . 
after the initial arrests ,  the police will extend the operation to apprehend as many militants as possible ,  mirza said . 
the strongholds of the banned outfits in karachi are nagan chowrangi ,  bufferzone ,  new karachi ,  orangi town and banaras . 
raids are being conducted in these areas ,  mirza added . 
he said <num>28</num>  alleged criminals had been arrested in raids ,  but their identities are being kept secret for interrogation and security purposes . 
malik said that in the past month more than <num>30</num>  people ,  including four doctors ,  have died in targeted killings in karachi . 
after a gap of a month or two ,  the terrorists suddenly resumed targeted killings in karachi ,  he said . 
mirza said the government is serious about cracking down on militancy and terrorism ,  and will not be deterred by threats . 
i am receiving threats from sipah-e-mohammad as i did not allow the outfit to  ( hold )  a protest rally in karachi . 
i am also motivating the government to start an operation against militants and that was annoying the terrorists ,  mirza said . 
malik said the government will get support from the political ,  ethnic and religious parties in karachi to discourage terrorism . 
malik does not see the need at the present time for a military operation in karachi . 
however if the law-and-order situation deteriorates then the military could be involved ,  he said . 
a number of the banned religious organizations have changed their names in an attempt to continue operating . 
malik said their offices would be sealed and their members arrested . 
hundreds of seminaries in karachi will also remain under police surveillance to determine whether or not the institutions are promoting terrorism ,  he said . 
musharrafs return deemed unlikely
former pakistani president  ( ret )  gen pervez musharraf makes a speech at chatham house ,  in london february <num>15</num>  .
musharraf has declared his desire to return to pakistani politics ,  saying he would do anything for pakistan . 
but if he were to return he would be arrested on a number of criminal charges . 
islamabad -- while former president  ( ret )  gen pervez musharraf has declared his desire to return to pakistan and run for political office ,  such a return is unlikely say analysts and political figures . 
although i am working to help musharraf get back into politics ,  until there is a big political change in the country i cannot advise him to come back ,  musharraf spokesman barrister muhammad ali saif said . 
it will be better to make money by giving lectures in foreign countries rather than coming back and spending time in jail . 
political campaigners for musharraf - including former presidential spokesman  ( ret )  gen rashid qureshi and barrister saif - have entered the political arena to seek political support for musharrafs party ,  the all pakistan muslim league . 
musharraf once was a popular leader in pakistan ,  but today even former loyalists are unlikely to even receive him at the airport . 
at a time when no one in the government ,  the judiciary and the army wants him back ,  i dont think he will try to come back ,  said islamabad-based senior journalist haroon ur rashid . 
the pakistan peoples party government is accused of helping musharraf flee ,  haroon said . 
the army is not interested in his return and most of the judges in judiciary are victims of musharraf ,  he said . 
musharraf has claimed to have <num>200,000</num>  supporters on facebook . 
it doesnt make any difference ,  haroon said . 
facebook is not for pakistani people only ;  there are also americans and people from other countries on facebook that is why they cannot be called pervez musharrafs supporters . 
fear of the judiciary and lack of public support will stop musharraf from coming back ,  an active member of pml-q said on condition of anonymity . 
the former president faces serious cases in various courts ,  ranging from the supreme court of pakistan to session court . 
some of the cases against musharaf include the imprisonment of <num>80</num>  senior judges ,  the murder of sardar nawab akbar khan bugty ,  the murder of benazir bhutto and the cases of hundreds of missing people . 
musharraf lacks immunity from criminal prosecution despite his status as a former president and army chief ,  according to constitutional and legal analysts . 
he is likely to be arrested if he returns to pakistan before those cases are decided ,  analysts said . 
one lawyer ,  barrister saif ,  said that the cases against musharraf are false . 
the taliban would be very happy to see him on pakistans land ,  he said . 
they cant wait to kill him . 
pakistans economy hit hard by war on terror

pakistans financial hub has been widely affected by terrorist activities . 
pakistans economic survey report says terrorism has taken a heavy toll on the economy . 
 [ rizwan tabassum / afp / getty images ] 
islamabad -- terrorism in pakistan cost the nation <num>6</num>  %  of its gross domestic product  ( gdp )  in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  , and has killed nearly <num>9,000</num>  pakistanis in the past eight years . 
terrorism has taken a heavy toll on pakistans economy since <num>2001</num>  , according to pakistans <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  economic survey report released earlier this month by the ministry of finance . 
militants intensified their campaign in <num>2009</num>  , specifically targeting pakistans urban centres ,  according to the interior ministrys national crisis management cell . 
officials recorded <num>1,906</num>  terror attacks in the country ,  resultng in <num>1,835</num>  deaths and <num>5,194</num>  injuries ,  from january <num>2009</num>  to april <num>2010</num>  .
pakistan has become an epicentre of terrorist activity since late <num>2001</num>  .
at least <num>8,141</num>  terrorist attacks have killed <num>8,875</num>  civilians and law-enforcement personnel ,  and injured <num>20,675</num>  , between the end of <num>2002</num>  and april <num>2010</num>  .
casualty tolls do not capture the cumulative effects of terrorism on the country ,  however . 
a decline in gdp growth ,  reductions in investment ,  lost exports ,  unemployment and the depreciation and inflation of incomes and exchange rates are the most affected areas of pakistans economy . 
the price of security-related and civil relief operations ,  for instance ,  demonstrates the magnitude of terrorisms direct costs :  pakistan has spent an additional us <num>4</num>  $  billion since <num>2007</num>  , the ministry reports ,  or <num>2.4</num>  %  of the average gdp . 
the government has also spent us <num>2.4</num>  %  during this fiscal year to help the more than <num>3</num>  meter  people displaced by terrorism and counter-terrorism operations . 
pakistan may face a permanent degree of welfare loss due to the diversion of development spending toward the security budget ,  capital flight and brain drain ,  and due to the trade diversion it has suffered since <num>2001</num>  , according to the report . 
electricity use in the industrial sector fell by <num>6.5</num>  %  while gas consumption by the industrial sector declined by <num>8.2</num>  %  . 
swat valley sees signs of peace returning
shop shutters painted with pakistani flags are opening for customers as normalcy returns to swat after successful military operations against taliban militants . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
swat -- the previously scared population of swat is now optimistic that a sense of normalcy will return to their lives very soon ,  after successful military operations and the dismantling of major terrorist groups . 
loud music can also be heard ,  as militants had banned playing music in the valley . 
unlike last year ,  many people were busy buying and selling in the cheena market  ( primarily for women )  ,  as well as china plaza ,  nishat chowk ,  sohrab chowk and other popular markets . 
many doors and shop shutters are painted with the pakistani flag . 
from mingora to kalam ,  one can see thousands of flags along the road . 
we have painted these flags on the doors to show our patriotism as well as support to the army in operation against militants . 
many have also written slogans in favour of the country and army ,  said naeem ,  a shopkeeper in barikot . 
education is also returning to normal ,  albeit in make-shift schools . 
our school was completely razed to ground . 
the swat police have introduced a special school security wing to teach safety to students and their parents . 
more than <num>200</num>  schools ,  <num>28</num>  police posts ,  four police stations ,  and several hospitals ,  dispensaries ,  houses ,  shops and other buildings were damaged during bomb ,  shelling and rocket attacks . 
reconstruction began in the district after people became confident that militants would not re-emerge . 
a six-storey building in our area was severely damaged during the violence . 
the owner has recently started re-construction after several months of peace in the area . 
several schools ,  health centres ,  trade centres and especially houses are being built ,  said ramzan ,  a resident of matta road in mingora . 
the construction of dozens of schools ,  hospitals ,  offices and police stations is underway . 
the government has provided compensation money to the locals to help them reconstruct their damaged houses ,  said an official of the district administration in swat . 
khyber pakhtunkhwas provincial government ,  according to reports ,  has sought rs <num>21</num>  billion from the federal government for the reconstruction of swat and other districts of malakand division . 
the picturesque valley is secure and tourists from the country and abroad are welcomed in swat ,  said ayub asharai ,  provincial minister from the area . 
asharai announced the construction of a park spread over <num>40</num>  acres in bedarra . 
while normalcy is returning to swat ,  military operations continue ,  and militants and their supporters are still apprehended almost every day . 
a list of around <num>150</num>  militants has been handed over to their respective families and they have been warned of being thrown out of swat if they refused to hand over the wanted men . 
peshawar - the wheels of justice often move slowly and expensively in pakistan ,  causing public disgust that reputedly strengthens the militancy . 
now khyber pakhtunkhwa is addressing this problem through a musalihatee ,  or reconciliatory committee ,  to restore public confidence and isolate the taliban . 
this dispute resolution method takes pressure off police ,  freeing them to tackle the militancy more efficiently ,  observers and police officials told central asia online . 
it is proving very good for the people ,  the police and ,  above all ,  the government ,  senior police official nisar tanoli said about the alternative mediation method in khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  where the taliban-linked militancy has wrought havoc for the past few years . 
it gives us space to take on the even bigger threat of militancy . 
the restorative justice system appeared in the united states in <num>1970</num>  and spread across the globe . 
its need here became felt when the fight against the militancy pressured the police and courts . 
police stations were flooded with petty cases while bombs were going off outside . 
a lack of judges and court facilities meant disputes took years to settle . 
that caused problems for the poor in particular ,  and the taliban exploited the situation by presenting an alternative system of quicker and cheaper justice . 
the ploy worked initially ,  as pakistanis said ,  the taliban are offering quicker and cheaper justice than the state does . 
that perception among the public set off alarm bells for the government . 
we first introduced the restorative justice system in the hazara region in <num>2008</num>  on an experimental basis ,  and when we got good results ,  this system was slowly and gradually extended to some other districts of pakhtunkhwa province ,  tanoli told central asia online . 
the musalihatee committee network extends to abbottabad ,  mansehra ,  haripur ,  swabi ,  mardan ,  nowshera and peshawar ,  where ,  according to police officials ,  encouraging results are coming in . 
the government eyes expansion of the system to all other districts of the province ;  however ,  logistical problems are causing some delays . 
the nowshera committee earns high praise from khyber pakhtunkhwa chief minister ameer haider hoti and police chief malik naveed khan . 
this system of dispute resolution is quick and cost-free too ,  said ali gohar ,  head of the ngo just peace international ,  which is working with police to run the alternative system . 
all sorts of disagreements - except terrorism and issues of the countrys defence and security - can be considered . 
a six-month review  ( september <num>2009</num>  to february <num>2010</num>  )  of musalihatees in nowshera underscores the public confidence in the system . 
some <num>1,587</num>  applications - including <num>21</num>  murder cases and <num>19</num>  for attempted murder - were received . 
women welcome the method because they can avoid lodging complaints at police stations ,  where they complain of unwanted attention by some policemen . 
we know women avoid going to the police station … the alternative dispute resolution mechanism ,  however ,  is bringing women to the musalihatees for resolution of their disputes with males ,  gohar said . 
women also are joining the committees ,  empowering themselves . 
we are encouraging women to come forward for resolution of their disputes with their men ,  gohar said . 
the panel settled the matter within a month by awarding two-thirds of the area to khawaray and one-third to dargai . 
land disputes can take generations to settle through regular pakistani courts . 
non-resolution of land quarrels in the swat valley contributed to the rise of taliban-linked militancy ,  when the lower class sought vengeance against long-time landlords . 
militants will find little public support if the state provides quick and cheap justice and improves services ,  observers said . 
kazakhstan has new head of national security committee

 ( photo by viktor drachev / afp / getty images ) 
<num>7</num>  , kazakh national security committee president amangeldy shabdarbayev tendered his resignation ,  which was accepted by president nazarbayev ,  who named nscs first deputy president ,  adil shayahmetov ,  to the position . 
the senate confirmed his appointment on <abbr>dec.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
shabdarbayev will now act as an advisor to the head of state . 
most commentators link the nsc chiefs resignation with the scandalous inter-departmental battles waged by his subordinates with the ministry of internal affairs and the financial police . 
freedom radio reported that the disputes came to a head with the arrest by almaty nsc officers of first deputy head of the almaty financial police department aydin zhanteleyev . 
criminal proceedings were then initiated against the nsc investigators . 
having replaced his former supervisor as president of the nsc ,  shayahmetov stated that he did not believe shabdarbayevs resignation had anything to do with the scandals engulfing the security services . 
i believe that the security council has become less effective of late . 
there has been a lot of bureaucracy and narrowness of focus . 
we need to make changes and overhaul the way we do things ,  he said . 
companies in europe and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  are against the use of child labour in harvesting uzbek cotton
the retail networks of tesco ,  marks  & amp ;  spencer ,  target ,  and the gap previously submitted a similar appeal to the government of uzbekistan-to stop using children and young people to harvest cotton . 
in november <num>2007</num>  , the very large finnish company marimekko stopped buying textiles manufactured by the estonian company kreenholm ,  claiming that the producer of the cloth was using cotton fibre harvested by uzbek children . 
tashkent is categorically denying all the accusations of using enforced child labour on cotton plantations . 
according to the financial times each year uzbekistan produces more than <num>800,000</num>  tonnes of cotton ,  worth more than <num>930</num>  $  million . 
according to approximate estimates ,  more than one-third of the cotton produced by the country goes to europe . 
tashkents new look creates some concern
tashkent used to have several areas with stately trees . 
now ,  one such area has been stripped of century-old trees ,  leaving green spaces like this fewer and farther between . 
 [ getty images ] 
tashkent ,  uzbekistan - first to go were the trees along amir timur avenue ;  now a former church building at the teachers college of matbuotchilar street is being razed . 
not long after tashkent celebrated <num>2,200</num>  years of history this fall ,  the cosmetic changes being made in the uzbek capital started creating some consternation . 
trees being cut down in a central square and avenue raised the most concern . 
i never worried about trees so much before . 
when i recall these memories i start crying ,  because i cannot change anything . 
the trees along amir timur avenue dated to the 19t century and ,  although the government said they were being cut down for sanitary reasons ,  tashkent residents said the trees appeared healthy . 
the blessed grand duke alexander nevsky church also dates to the late 19t century . 
it is unclear what will be built in its place ,  though bloggers speculate its demolition is linked to a forum palace built earlier this year . 
the embassy of uzbekistan to the united states defended changes to the city . 
our state has always been tenderly preserving the national heritage of its people ,  it said in a press release issued before the trees were cut down in late november . 
the embassy said tashkent has been spending much effort in restoring monuments . 
when officials cut down the trees ,  though ,  the action drew protests . 
pakistans fight against militants poses threats to journalists
a police officer stands in front of the peshawar press club . 
the media in pakistan are facing serious threats amid a military offensive that is going on against the taliban and al-qaeda in south waziristan . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan- armed guards stop visitors on the ground floor for a security check and then more guards ask them to wait on the fifth floor before they can enter the premises of pakistans most widely watched private tv channel . 
we are taking these threats seriously and that is why we have stepped up security measures ,  the burly-looking senior journalist added . 
the ttp says it has been singled out in the media coverage of the offensive ,  following the federal governments instructions that zero-level tolerance would be exhibited if the media was open to the militants propaganda . 
since the september <num>11</num>  terrorist attacks in the united states ,  the security situation in pakistan has deteriorated and so has the situation for press freedom . 
the country is experiencing regular bombings and suicide attacks . 
these have left thousands of civilians ,  police and paramilitary personnel and soldiers dead ;  and <num>29</num>  journalists ,  including daniel pearl of us daily the wall street journal ,  have been killed since <num>2002</num>  .
last year pakistan was second to iraq in the number of journalist fatalities when <num>12</num>  were reported . 
this year the country shares the record with somalia with six journalists reported killed . 
we have to walk a fine thin line ,  jan said ,  explaining how difficult it is to balance reporting in the face of threats from both sides . 
both parties expect favour from the media . 
the security threat to the media is so high geo news channels peshawar office is protected by <num>16</num>  private security guards around the clock . 
other media offices in peshawar and other big cities do the same . 
we have been told there should be no coverage of taliban nor their press conferences will be attended ,  nor their videos aired on any news channel ,  khattak ,  <num>33</num>  , told central asia online . 
we are in a situation between the deep sea and the devil . 
it appears the threats are geared primarily toward electronic media . 
the ttp focuses on radio networks followed in the countrys rural and tribal areas and tv ,  with it strong images from battle zones . 
alamgir bitani ,  voice of americas pashto language radio correspondent ,  said he was worried about the situation . 
the problem is the taliban militants phone you and the government agencies intercept such calls and their interpretation of conversation with the militants is totally different ,  he told central asia online . 
as a reporter visited one radio journalist a call came in from a taliban spokesman . 
security concerns aside ,  international press freedom organizations are worried by the situation in pakistan . 
for decades ,  press freedom in pakistan was jeopardized by the state ,  … but for two years ,  it is under attack by a new enemy - the taliban and other extremist groups . 
such violence is not completely new ,  but since <num>2007</num>  , it has reached a critical level of killings ,  threats and censorship . 
five tribal journalists have been killed since february <num>2005</num>  and many others have quit the profession or migrated to safer places like dera ismail khan to escape physical harm , 
the journalists organization is taking up the security threats with top government officials ,  but there seems little change on the ground . 
we have taken up the issue of security threats during our meeting with president asif ali zardari and we are waiting  ( to see )  what steps the government will take ,  pervaiz shaukat ,  president of pakistan federal union of journalists ,  said by phone from islamabad . 
because of the increasing number of attacks in pakistans cities ,  journalists have restricted their movement to avoid taliban-linked bombings . 
this has affected their ability to do their work and has led to self-censorship . 
ismail khan ,  editor of the dawn newspaper for the frontier province ,  said both sides respect press freedom as long as it suits their agenda . 
we have to report what we see ,  hear or observe . 
but having said this ,  we must all understand that these are difficult times and therefore ,  at times one has to use ones own discretion ,  and not censorship ,  about what is shareable and what is not shareable with the readers . 
uzbek elections pass without significant controversy
the uzbek central election committee ran billboard ads ahead of sundays election . 
 [ rashid musayev ] 
it was not a case of one vote per person in uzbekistans elections sunday ;  sometimes it was one voter per family . 
my family is still sleeping ;  we dont care who to vote for . 
we dont even know who the candidates are ,  she said . 
sobir ,  <num>56</num>  , said he also voted for his whole family . 
my kids and wife have no idea about the candidates . 
the election committee members here tell everyone where to put the cross ,  and so i did . 
i read the last name of the person i voted for and just found out it is the mayor of our city ,  he said . 
police and national security service representatives were at every polling station ,  watching the voters . 
central asia onlines correspondent did not witness active voting ,  and by <num>3</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr>  there were almost no voters . 
the election committee members either showed or at least hinted to voters who they should vote for ,  according to the reporter . 
central asia onlines correspondent reported most of the voters were elderly ,  though he noticed some students at polling stations near universities . 
a representative of an opposition party ,  who didnt want to give his name ,  said ,  the election of <num>2009</num>  is a performance . 
we have about <num>3</num>  million labour migrants in russia and central asia . 
will they be participating in the election ? 
probably their relatives will be forced to vote instead of them . 
the osce office for democratic institutions and human rights spokesperson jens eschenbaecher told central asia online there would be no preliminary statement because the osce sent only <num>14</num>  people to assess the vote in uzbekistan this time . 
in its pre-election needs assessment report ,  it said ,  the current political spectrum does not offer the electorate a genuine choice between competing political alternatives . 
other foreign observers said the elections followed international standards . 
bushman gubta ,  from india ,  said ,  everything is organized on the international standards level . 
especially the polling boxes ;  we dont have that in india . 
in the evening ,  the central election committee  ( cec )  members and police representatives ,  visited hospitals and multi-storied buildings telling those who hadnt voted that they must do it as soon as possible . 
uzbekistan president islam karimov voted sunday morning . 
he told uzbek state tv ,  i am sure the principles of justice and transparency will be strictly observed during todays elections . 
elections mean a free voting with deep understanding of ones rights . 
by participating in the elections ,  we not only realize our right to vote ,  guaranteed by the constitution ,  but also acknowledge our responsibility for the future of our motherland . 
the cec reported at <num>10</num>  : <num>30</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr>  that about <num>15.1</num>  million voters ,  or <num>87.8</num>  percent of registered voters ,  cast ballots . 
cec chairman mirza-ulugbek abdusalomov said the elections of the deputies of the legislative chamber are considered legally valid . 
the chairman said that ,  the elections were held with observance of all democratic norms and principles ,  outlined in the constitution and in the election laws ,  and that no information on violations of the election legislation were received . 
uzbekistan has <num>135</num>  polling districts with <num>8,447</num>  polling stations . 
more than <num>500</num>  parliamentary candidates fought for <num>135</num>  seats . 
central asian countries sentence more islamists to prison for longer terms
bishkek - central asian governments dont differentiate between moderate ,  non-violent islamic religious movements and radical ones ,  deepening the divide between secular governments and the faithful ,  according to a new report by the international crisis group  ( icg )  . 
and just as communist revolutionaries a century ago called prisons universities of the revolution ,  central asian radical islamists might be using prisons to recruit and organise new followers . 
central asia :  islamists in prison ,  finds that problems within jails in central asia have been known to seep outside the prison walls and the expansion of radical islamist thought within prisons is likely to have serious consequences . 
the icg is an international non-governmental organization dedicated to preventing conflict . 
the report was published december <num>15</num>  .
the report notes that politicians in kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan are very aware that addressing social and economic conditions and fighting corruption are the best ways to defeat extremism . 
but too often ,  faced with the risk of renewed islamic insurgency ,  central asian governments target radical islamists and send more of them to prison for longer periods of time . 
such tough steps give the appearance of an effective policy ,  but probably advance the islamist cause ,  the report says . 
many islamists see the prisons as one arena of their political struggle ,  and a place to recruit new followers . 
islamists who are sent to prison have also begun challenging the obshchak ,  the organisation created by criminal prisoners that has traditionally held power inside central asian prisons . 
prison directors are often reduced to mere observers of the power struggle taking place within their own establishments ,  the report concludes ,  and it says islamists will soon wield more power in the prisons than criminal structures . 
that power is not limited by prison walls ,  as corruption and underpaid staff often run errands and do tasks for prisoners in the outside world . 
with some access to both prisoners and prison officials in kyrgyzstan ,  and prison officials in kazakhstan ,  the study was able to get some sense of the penal systems in those countries . 
in tajikistan ,  turkmenistan and uzbekistan conditions are believed to be even worse ,  and the numbers of jailed islamists much higher ,  but there is no access and little information available about life behind prison walls there . 
in uzbekistan - with a prison population estimated at <num>34,000</num>  - an overwhelming majority of the <num>4,400</num>  political prisoners are believed to be islamists . 
the report did not provide figures for other central asian countries . 
the report says the islamists are using their time in prison as just one dimension of a political strategy aimed at establishing an islamic state across the whole region . 
russian language increases in popularity in southern kyrgyzstan
more parents in southern kyrgyzstan are choosing to send their children to russian-language schools with the hope that they will get an education that will serve them better . 
 [ bakyt ibraimov ] 
osh - in the southern kyrgyz city of osh ,  where inhabitants are mostly ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks ,  an increasing number of students are learning in russian . 
we have had to start offering classes with russian language instruction in some kyrgyz and uzbek secondary schools ,  abdivali baltabayev ,  the head of the osh education administration ,  told central asia online . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  parents want their children to receive a school education in the official language . 
kyrgyz and russian are official languages . 
a total of <num>57</num>  secondary schools operate in osh . 
seven conduct classes in russian . 
most of the remainder are kyrgyz ,  uzbek and mixed schools ,  so-called national schools because they teach in the language of one or the other nationality . 
in northern kyrgyzstan most education has long been done in russian . 
many parents are motivated by the fact that they want their children to speak russian well ,  kantserova said . 
an osh city hall employee ,  who asked to remain anonymous ,  admitted there are other reasons :  in many of the national schools ,  the disciplining of students is weak and their educational work is poorly conducted . 
moreover ,  these schools are less well-equipped with teaching materials and textbooks on school subjects . 
teachers say the lack of textbooks in the uzbek language is an obstacle . 
students have to study with textbooks left over from soviet times or published in soviet uzbekistan . 
the reason for this is a lack of funding in the state budget . 
the reluctance to get a secondary education in uzbek schools is due to the fact that the quality of the teachers leaves much to be desired ,  noted the director of one local school ,  who asked to remain anonymous . 
given the lack of qualified teachers ,  we are forced to hire graduates from local universities who do not have work experience . 
moreover ,  in some schools senior university students conduct the classes . 
local officials think the number of students in national schools is decreasing not only because of the students desire to get an education in russian ,  but also because of a downward trend in the overall number of students . 
in the <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  academic year ,  our general-education schools had <num>51,862</num>  graduates ,  whereas in the <num>2007</num> -<num>08</num>  academic there were <num>53,628</num>  and in the <num>2006</num> -<num>07</num>  academic year there were <num>54,549</num>  students ,  baltabayev said . 
according to him ,  this is due not only to the migration of students parents to other cities and countries ,  but also the overall demographic situation in kyrgyzstan . 
however ,  according to the national statistics committee ,  the population of kyrgyzstan on january <num>1</num>  , <num>2009</num>  totalled <num>5,276,100</num>  people ,  <num>183,300</num>  more than in <num>2005</num>  .
kazakhstan outlines <num>2010</num>  osce priorities
kazakhstans secretary of state and foreign minister kanat saudabayev outlines kazakhstans priorities for its chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe  ( osce )  on january <num>14</num>  in vienna . 
kazakhstan took over the one year chairmanship of the osce from greece january <num>1</num>  .
 [ samuel kubani / afp / getty images ] 
kanat saudabayev ,  osce chairman-in-office and the kazakh secretary of state and foreign minister ,  along with president nursultan nazarbayev ,  outlined their vision for kazakhstans chairmanship in speeches delivered in vienna january <num>14</num>  .
saudabayev appeared before the osce permanent council ,  while nazarbayevs remarks were contained in a video-taped speech shown at the meeting . 
wolfgang zellner ,  head of the center for osce research in germany ,  told central asia online ,  not every chairman-in-office pays a visit to the south caucasus so early ,  and this is a good sign . 
but zellner says kazakhstan will not be able to do much with regards to afghanistan as there is no basis for the osce to work inside or outside of afghanistan . 
former kazakh senator zauresh battalova ,  now with the civil society foundation in astana said ,  in relation to those priorities which kazakhstan has set ;  they have a place and there is no doubt that their realization is necessary to support security and stability at the international level . 
saudabayev also mentioned economic-environmental issues ,  tolerance ,  trafficking and gender issues as main priorities ,  which according to zellner is not a big surprise either . 
much of what he said was decided at the osce ministerial council in athens . 
but analysts found saudabayevs expressions of support for ,  and expressed commitment to work with the osces office for democratic institutions and human rights  ( odihr )  ,  and the representative on freedom of the media ,  interesting . 
ainur kurmanov of the talmas movement in almaty said kazakhstans chairmanship of the osce so far does nothing for the democratization of the country . 
the promises made by kazakhstan before its chairmanship to the osce for liberalization of laws which regulate freedom of assembly ,  freedom of speech ,  freedom of conscience ,  and the right on political association … were not fulfilled ,  he said . 
now is the time when the leaders of the osce-participating states should demonstrate their political will and focus on solutions to the difficult challenges facing our nations . 
a summit would not only give a powerful impetus to adapting the osce to modern challenges and threats ,  but would also increase the confidence and respect enjoyed by the organization itself among our peoples ,  he said . 
the council didnt say yes or no ,  but something really important must happen during this year - like a major break in one of the protracted conflicts or a security document signed . 
otherwise i cant imagine  ( us president barack )  obama or  ( russian president dmitri )  medvedev and others gathering in kazakhstan - they are all busy people . 
if an osce summit is agreed to ,  it would likely be held sometime this summer . 
prosecution of journalists in tajikistan said to have chilling effect
paikon ,  a weekly newspaper ,  published an open letter accusing a state agency of corruption and creation of obstacles to business . 
a court ordered the paper to pay <num>300,000</num>  tjs  ( us <num>69,000</num>  $  )  in damages to the agency . 
tajikstandart claimed the signatures on the letter were false . 
the presence of articles criminalising libel and defamation in tajikistans legislation limits the ability to enjoy the democratic principle of the freedom of speech in media ,  nuriddin karshibayev ,  chairman of the national association of independent media of tajikistan  ( nansmit )  ,  told central asia online . 
for several years ,  media organisations have specifically worked to decriminalise libel and defamation ,  he said . 
at present ,  no tangible results have been observed ,  as authorities are still not ready to discuss the topic . 
at issue is whether government officials and agencies should be able to claim defamation . 
according to international norms ,  the concept of honour and dignity belongs to individuals ,  while the concept of commercial reputation applies to private companies . 
in the paikon case ,  the court ruled that tajikstandart ,  a government agency ,  could suffer defamation . 
the union of journalists of tajikistan  ( szht )  and nansmit have urged the appellate courts and judicial supervisory authority to take into account these international norms with regard to paikon . 
we are deeply convinced that sanctions on the media should not lead to the bankruptcy or closure of publications ,  the groups said in a january 12t statement . 
article <num>13</num>  of the tajik criminal code provides criminal liability for libel . 
the criminal code also provides special protection for public officials ,  with article <num>137</num>  protecting the president from libel and defamation and article <num>330</num>  protecting government officials . 
rakhmatillo zoiirov ,  chairman of the ngo tajik consortium ,  said ,  according to these articles ,  the head of state and high-ranking officials have special immunity and are subject to special protection ,  even though the countrys constitution says that everyone is equal before the law . 
he said the laws provide stricter punishment for libel and defamation of officials than for that of ordinary citizens ,  violating the principle of equal protection . 
another problem is the high compensation that courts set for civil claims and the alleged disproportionality of fines for moral damages . 
one recent case followed the publication last july of a letter from a rudaki village resident and an article written by a lawyer ,  both questioning <num>31</num>  year sentences given to a group of teenagers and questioning the judges handling of the case . 
the judge accused the editors and authors of libel and defamation and demanded compensation of <num>10,000</num>  times the minimum wage ,  <num>300,000</num>  tjs  ( us <num>69,000</num>  $  )  . 
latypova did not have information on the trials progress because authorities removed the judge from office several months ago . 
latypova said judges need to take into account the poor finances of newspapers and their role as public watchdogs . 
many newspapers would have to close if they had to satisfy a huge court-ordered settlement . 
but simonov is not sure changing the laws will be sufficient because the laws have ceased to obey public opinion ,  and public opinion has stopped working in central asia . 
simonov says the only real solution is to bring international pressure to bear on countries that pass such laws . 
gulmira kuzhukeyeva ,  a lawyer with the internews network in kazakhstan ,  said there have been at least four unsuccessful attempts to decriminalise libel and defamation in kyrgyzstan . 
then-kyrgyz president askar akayev initiated the first attempt in <num>1997</num>  , but parliament refused to support him . 
kuzhukeyeva said the number of lawsuits against the media has grown steadily ,  with most of them alleging libel and defamation . 
this is due to several factors ,  she said . 
the burden of proof rests on the defendant  [ the media ]  ,  the defendant is responsible regardless of whether he was aware of the falsity of the information ,  the fee plaintiffs are charged for filing defamation lawsuits is very low and it is possible to receive monetary compensation for moral damages caused to the claimant . 
moreover ,  there are no clear criteria in the legislation for the amount of compensation for moral damages . 
the result ,  according to journalists and human rights advocates ,  is that defamation and libel laws have become a useful tool for governments to control their critics or to bankrupt them into silence . 
the main building of the cica secretariat in almaty
opening the third ministerial meeting of the conference on interaction and confidence-building measures in asia  ( cica )  on <abbr>aug.</abbr> 
unfortunately ,  there are still many hotbeds of instability and tension on the asian continent . 
the situation in afghanistan is still causing great concern . 
this long-suffering country has become one of the largest centres of the international narcotics industry which accounts for about a third of the annual turnover of the economy of terrorism ,  nazarbayev said . 
we have to take all efforts to enable afghanistan to quickly switch to a peaceful life . 
using all the opportunities of collective diplomacy ,  we should direct our efforts towards fighting international terrorism ,  religious extremism ,  organised crime ,  drugs trafficking and illegal migration ,  nazarbayev added . 
he also said asian countries should strengthen cooperation in the military-political sphere to this end . 
russian deputy foreign minister aleksey borodavkin used the cica meeting as a platform to convey his countrys version of the war in the caucasus . 
this cica meeting is being held against the background of the recent tragedy in the caucasus . 
as the result of georgian military aggression against south ossetia ,  thousands of people ,  civilians ,  many of whom were russian citizens ,  died . 
protecting them ,  dozens of russian peacekeepers laid down their lives . 
georgian armed forces barbarously fusilladed the capital of south ossetia ,  tskhinvali ,  and razed dozens of south ossetian villages to the ground ,  borodavkin said . 
he blamed a lack of understanding concerning whether it was inadmissible to use force unilaterally without <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  sanction . 
the south ossetian tragedy has become a graphic example that in the world ,  unfortunately ,  there is no strong understanding of the inadmissibility of aggression and illegal unilateral use of force bypassing the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  charter ,  borodavkin said . 
only thanks to the involvement of russia ,  which forced georgia to peace ,  was it possible to stop this criminal war unleashed by tbilisi ,  which aimed to physically kill residents of south ossetia . 
nuclear disarmament in asia was also touched on at the conference . 
nazarbayev called for a diplomatic solution for iran . 
election observers in tajikistan point to some errors but hope for transparent elections
dushanbe - registration of candidates for the february <num>28</num>  elections for the lower house of parliament is finished ,  and <num>266</num>  candidates ,  <num>73</num>  of whom are affiliated with parties ,  will compete for the <num>61</num>  seats . 
on february <num>8</num>  , the election observation mission from the organisation for security and co-operation in europes office for democratic institutions and human rights  ( osce / odihr )  issued its first interim report on the elections . 
in the report ,  experts and observers express concern that the lack of domestic ,  non-partisan observation could significantly hinder the transparency of the elections . 
i think only domestic observers acting in the nongovernmental sector could provide an objective evaluation of the elections . 
after all ,  the results are not important to us ;  the process itself is important for us ,  said the representative of a rasht region nongovernmental organisation who requested anonymity . 
they criticise and really point out the shortcomings of our elections . 
according to the osces estimation ,  <num>540</num>  international representatives from the osce / odihr ,  osce parliamentary assembly ,  european parliament ,  sco and cis will be observing the february <num>28</num>  elections . 
mamadazimov said the presence of national observers is important for electoral transparency as it allows civil society to independently evaluate the electoral process . 
the association of political scientists of tajikistan is preparing national observers but by law can train only political parties and media representatives . 
farangis azizova ,  general manager of the tajik office of the international foundation for electoral systems  ( ifes )  ,  told central asia online that an effort was made last year to amend the election law to permit more observers but that parliament did not take up the amendment . 
among them are recommendations for inclusive and pluralistic training of electoral commissions ,  clear statutes on voter registration and voting ,  procedures for ballot counting and procedures for handling complaints about electoral violations . 
mamadazimov said ,  thanks to the high deposit ,   [ t ] here was most likely an order from above not to impede the registration of parliamentary candidates from the opposition . 
if they dont win ,  the deposit will not be returned and will be transferred to the budget . 
the osce / odihr also points to the lack of media access in remote areas ,  a lack of media plurality ,  and libel and slander laws that might inhibit media from reporting complaints and violations . 
some resent the osce / odihr telling tajiks what to do . 
the recommendations of the osce / odihr do not always correspond to the realities of our lives ,  said nusratullo khalimov ,  an activist in the tajikistan youth union . 
if we say that we do not have universal values that are important for every person ,  then we would revert back to hundreds of years ago ,  where there would be no respect for people ,  women ,  he said . 
it would be an egocentric government ,  an egocentric society where everyone could do what they want . 
international experts and observers have so far refrained from preliminary evaluations based on current observations and forecasts . 
however ,  ifes office head michael getto said ,  the elections may be held transparently and democratically if the law is enforced at all levels . 
what is most important is for the law to be followed by local authorities . 
tajik youth show upsurge of interest in islam

some experts predict tajikistan may become an islamic state as interest in islam continues to grow . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
dushanbe - islam is winning over numerous youths in tajikistan . 
young citizens are attending friday prayer in growing numbers ,  fasting and performing salat . 
more and more women are wearing the chador . 
akhror khakimov ,  <num>19</num>  , said a desire to perform salat - participate in the five daily prayers - came over him after a few of his friends began to attend mosque . 
my parents never performed salat ,  he said . 
i myself learned this recently and am proud that i became closer to the religion and allah ,  because faith in the almighty is the one thing that remains holy in our modern lives . 
i was used to wearing european clothing ,  but i gradually started getting used to the chador ,  she said . 
i reconciled myself to it . 
preserving the family was ,  of course ,  most important . 
at first ,  many friends wondered how i could agree to this ,  but now many girls are wearing the chador and society is already comfortable with this . 
zulfiya atoyeva ,  a professor of english in dushanbe ,  expressed concern about the situation . 
rustam ergashev ,  a supplier of turkish outerwear to dushanbe markets ,  said last year he did not supply european womens clothing because the demand for it was practically nonexistent . 
women buy national fabrics and hijabs ,  so bringing in european womens clothing is pointless ,  he said . 
now i deliver only mens and childrens clothing ,  something that brings in a good income . 
makhmadali khaitov ,  deputy chairman of the islamic renaissance party of tajikistan ,   ( pivt )  explains this phenomenon as the return of tajiks to the purity of islam . 
when the authorities try to restrict the activities of political parties <abbr>…</abbr>  the youth have no choice but to join the pivt ,  he said . 
the authorities are trying ,  to some extent ,  to give priority to the pivt in order to draw investment from islamic countries into the countrys economy . 
according to him ,  the government has not fought the spiritual rebirth ,  but has encouraged it . 
this is reflected in the opening of madrasas - islamic schools - and the only islamic higher educational institution in central asia that is funded by the state ,  he said . 
a separate discipline on the study of islam has been introduced in schools . 
all of this suggests that the authorities are trying to control the spread of islam ,  not only in the countrys political life but also in education . 
olimov said that even though the country has a firmly secular constitution ,  the state could still take on an islamic orientation . 
therefore ,  tajikistan has strong odds of becoming an islamic state . 
khakimov contended that tajikistan is an indisputably secular state . 
according to him ,  other countries have shown that when representatives of religious organisations gain power ,  they have the ability to initiate a referendum for the adoption of a new constitution or to make amendments . 
the countrys authorities must find solutions to  [ our ]  socioeconomic problems and ensure a decent life for tajik society in order to prevent any kind of extremism ,  he said . 
dovudkhon abdukhon ,  vice dean of the islamic department of the imam al-azam islamic institute in dushanbe ,  is confident that in the next decade tajikistan will not become an islamic state . 
perhaps our society will become more religious ,  but that is logical ,  he said . 
today ,  more than <num>97</num>  %  of the countrys population is muslim ,  but this does not mean our country should declare itself islamic . 
despite the support of tajikistans authorities for islam ,  <num>14</num>  islamic organisations have been banned by the state ,  according to the prosecutor-general . 
among them are :  al-qaeda ,  the islamic movement of eastern turkestan ,  the islamic party of turkestan ,  the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  ,  the taliban ,  the muslim brotherhood ,  lashkari taiba ,  the islamic group ,  jamaat-e-islami of pakistan ,  jamaat ut-tabligh ,  sozmoni tabligot ,  tajikistan-i ozod ,  hizb ut-tahrir and salafiya . 
according to various sources ,  over the past two years more than <num>50</num>  people were sent to prison in tajikistan for membership in salafiya ,  hizm-ut-tahrir and the imu . 
along with several other organisations ,  the activities of the party hizb ut-tahrir are prohibited in tajikistan ,  he said . 
this is the right thing to do ,  since the activities of this organisation are prohibited in many countries and it really does threaten state security . 
tajikistans pivt is the only officially functioning islamic party in the commonwealth of independent states . 
established in <num>1991</num>  , the pivt became the core of the former united tajik opposition during the <num>1992</num> -<num>1997</num>  civil war . 
the government froze its activities in response . 
in <num>1998</num>  , the pivt regained official status . 
the party won two seats in the lower house of parliament in the <num>2005</num>  elections . 
according to the party's leadership ,  it has approximately <num>35,000</num>  members ,  half of whom are women . 
uzbekistan and tajikistan argue over talco emissions
talco official abdugafor abdullayev  ( right )  measures air fluorine content . 
uzbek environmentalists call the talco smelter a gross polluter ,  while tajiks call it the cleanest smelter in the cis . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe - for <num>35</num>  years uzbeks have lived with an aluminium smelter near its border with tajikistan . 
not once in all this time have the uzbek environmentalists been able to prove that the environment is being harmed ,  tajik environmentalist atakhon latifi said . 
tajiks reject the criticism ,  calling the smelter the cleanest of its kind in the commonwealth of independent states . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  nobody would be left living here if the industrial emissions contained toxic substances . 
the talco complaints are part of an artificially created environmental organisation personally overseen by uzbek president islam karimov ,  tajik political analyst saimiddin dustov said . 
this is not so much tied to the plants environmental faults as it is to tajikistans building of the rogun ges . 
the most recent complaint about talco came in march ,  when uzbeks in surkhandarya oblast protested a proposed expansion of its operational capacity . 
uzbekistan is opposing the increase in the plants production capacity to <num>517,000</num>  tonnes per year ,  but this is the rated capacity of the plant ,  nothing more ,  nothing less ,  said bakhodor urumbayev ,  director of occupational safety ,  ecology and quality control at the factory . 
the plant has never reached that level of production ,  he said . 
presently ,  talco emits approximately <num>300</num> -<num>400</num>  tonnes of hydrogen fluoride  ( annually )  into the atmosphere ,  the uzbek state committee for nature protection has contended . 
the proposed production increase would raise emissions to <num>500</num>  tonnes annually ,  it claims . 
the maximum allowable concentration of hydrogen fluoride emissions in the atmosphere is <num>0.5</num>  miligram  per cubic metre ,  he said . 
on plant property ,  it is now <num>0.02</num>  miligram  per cubic metre . 
his lab tests the air daily ,  he said . 
uzbek leaders ,  even in soviet times ,  periodically rallied about the perceived evils of talco ,  koshlakov recalled . 
but those protests always dwindled because several environmental committees worked at the plant . 
there was a large international crew . 
…they established the aluminium plants level of impact on the environment . 
moscow would have closed the smelter had the uzbeks had a valid point ,  he said . 
a soviet-era official from the uzbek side disagreed with koshlakov . 
in those years ,  neither uzbekistan nor tajikistan spoke about adverse effects on the ecosystem . 
the uzbeks are short on proof that talco is causing problems ,  kosklakov said . 
simply saying the vineyards are drying does not tell us anything . 
but tashkent claims the smelter is a rogue operation . 
tajikistan has operated in bad faith ,  the uzbek state committee for nature protection claimed ,  citing a november <num>1994</num>  agreement the two governments signed promising to improve the environment . 
the tajiks never coughed up the funding they promised for remediation and research programmes ,  the committee said . 
 ( and )  talco is planning to conduct an international environmental assessment of the business ,  she said . 
dustov said uzbekistan is agitated enough about the project that it might even resort to force . 
the task of the uzbek side is to  ( thwart )  this project ,  and i think they will accomplish this ,  said dustov . 
kazakhs ,  uzbeks show well at judo tournament
suwon ,  south korea - for the second tournament in a row ,  uzbekistans martial artists had a strong showing . 
all three of them walked away with medals from the judo world masters tournament in suwon ,  south korea . 
the two-member kazakh team also won a medal . 
the uzbek team finished fourth overall in the january 16th-17th tournament ,  which featured competitors from more than <num>30</num>  countries . 
the tournament has a us <num>200,000</num>  $  purse and is part of the international judo federation  ( ijf ) s world circuit . 
after suffering disappointment in last months tokyo grand slam ,  rishod sobirov won all four of his matches - including a victory over the rival who eliminated him in tokyo - to take gold in the under-60kg weight class . 
choriev fell to kirill denisov of russia but clinched a bronze medal ,  as he had done in tokyo last month . 
choriev has seven medals in international competition ,  including two gold and one silver . 
he ranks fourth in the world in his weight class ,  according to the ijf . 
representing the kazakhs ,  maxim rakov put up a valiant fight in the under-100kg semifinals but could not top eventual gold medallist takamasa anai of japan . 
rakov did ,  though ,  clinch a bronze medal - his fourth medal in international competition in the past three years . 
he moved up to fourth in the world rankings . 
all five central asian competitors are likely to qualify for the <num>2010</num>  paris grand slam ,  which is the next stop on the ijf world circuit and is scheduled for february 6th and 7th . 
the three uzbek men and rakov are also likely to qualify for the mens world cup in tblisi ,  georgia  ( january 30t and 31st )  . 
poor peshawar village home of squash dynasty
salman mohib and saqib zia play squash at the qamar zaman squash complex ,  peshawar . 
the nearby village of neway kelay has produced seven squash world champions . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan - when airplanes makes their final approach to peshawar international airports lone runway ,  they fly over the ramshackle houses of historic neway kelay . 
but this poor town has an even greater claim to fame :  it has produced seven squash world champions for pakistan ,  including five from a single family . 
in fact ,  they are the only squash champions the country has produced . 
the champions villa in the village ,  located about 2km west of the peshawar cantonment on a road leading to the tribal khyber agency ,  is a small unkempt building that is currently used by the grandchildren of hashim khan . 
he was the first of the champions from the khan dynasty . 
once ,  there were plans to develop neway kelay as a model village in recognition of the khans . 
but those promises went unfulfilled . 
former squash player farmanullah ,  who became a businessman ,  says the town doesnt have even a single squash court . 
their collective destination is the practise courts in the cantonment . 
he won the games biggest tournament for seven years :  <num>1951</num>  - <num>1956</num>  and again in <num>1958</num>  .
a relative ,  roshan khan ,  interrupted his winning streak in <num>1957</num>  .
from <num>1954</num>  through <num>1963</num>  , every british open final became a family show - a duel between the khans from neway kelay . 
roshan khan won the british open every year from <num>1959</num>  to <num>1962</num>  .
in <num>1963</num>  , the championship tradition carried down to roshans son ,  mohibbullah khan . 
pakistan did not win the tournament for the next <num>11</num>  years ,  but another denizen of neway kelay ,  qamar zaman ,  brought it home in <num>1975</num>  by defeating compatriot gogi allaunddin . 
even then ,  the best was still to come . 
jehangir khan ,  son of roshan khan and brother of mohibbullah senior ,  is arguably the best player who ever lived . 
advised by a doctor never to play squash after a childhood illness ,  jehangir emerged as british open champion in <num>1982</num>  by beating hiddy jahan <num>9</num> -<num>2</num>  , <num>10</num> -<num>9</num>  and <num>9</num> -<num>3</num>  .
neway kelay has produced seven world champions for the country who have ruled over the game for <num>37</num>  long years . 
he said peshawar has <num>35</num>  squash courts . 
but ,  access isnt universal . 
according to him ,  government officials reserve some courts for their own exercise ,  leaving those who want to make a future in squash on the outside looking in . 
neway kelays status as home of squash champions is inseparably tied to the khan family . 
the familys passion for the game has rubbed off on others in the village ,  leading them to see squash as a way out of poverty ,  even though the games players and fans are mostly middle and upper class . 
some budding players are jealous of the attention given to the youngsters from the champion family . 
had we played these championships ,  most of our players would be in the top <num>100</num>  of the world ,  said nosherwan khan ,  an <num>18</num> -year-old star who is preparing for the world open ,  to be held in the united states this august . 
look ,  this is a cycle ,  he said . 
presently ,  players from other countries are dominant ,  and we are not producing champs . 
i dont see anyone in the existing lot . 
but from among the next generation ,  yes ,  i am sure we will produce more champions very soon . 
archa-beshik ,  kyrgyzstan - golden eagles are beishenaaly konurbayevs whole life . 
i have dedicated my entire life to eagles . 
all of my best memories are connected to them ,  he said . 
once ,  a golden eagle even saved my life . 
konurbayev ,  an eagle trainer or berkutchu ,  in chui oblast ,  kyrgyzstan ,  said ,  my favourite golden eagle ,  which i named ak-tumshuk  ( white beak )  ,  was very smart and strong . 
in <num>1984</num>  , while hunting in the mountains ,  i came across a wolf . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  the wolf grinned and was about to throw himself on me . 
after that ,  konurbayev freed ak-tumshuk . 
it is common practise for us to release hunting birds as a sign of gratitude ,  he explained . 
konurbayev has kept eagles for more than <num>30</num>  years . 
he said berkutchu need to know how to recognise the hunting instinct in small chicks . 
you must know how to observe ,  evaluate and develop the birds natural instincts ,  he said . 
but the most important thing is to love birds . 
without this ,  incompetent berkutchu risk raising not a faithful friend ,  but a sworn enemy . 
konurbayev presently keeps one very young eagle . 
he entered a courtyard to show off the bird ,  which was sharpening its claws on a stone . 
the black bird spread its powerful wings . 
the owner had it step onto his gloved hand and admired the birds strength and beauty . 
bela-berkut  ( baby eagle )  will earn a new name once its trainer sees how it hunts . 
i searched for a golden-eagle nest for a long time . 
finally ,  i found one . 
i carefully made my way to the nest ,  and in it i saw two chicks . 
i took one and left the second . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  as the chicks grow ,  the strong will kill their weaker brothers . 
during such training ,  sticking to a diet is necessary :  the wrong amount of food will adversely affect the birds character . 
konurbayev set his new pet on the grass . 
he said the eagle will be able to hunt rabbits and foxes . 
whether this golden eagle will be able ,  like ak-tumshuk ,  to take on a wolf is still difficult to say "  ,  he said . 
 " he's on the small side . 
in six or seven months ,  i plan to take him on his first real hunt . 
we will see what his first trophies will be "  . 
buzkashi survives in central and south asia
buzkashi is a rugged game traditionally played in afghanistan ,  pakistan and the central asian states . 
afghan refugees brought the game to pakistan from afghanistan . 
 [ ghani kakar ] 
quetta - the rules sound simple enough to those who know the game . 
you cant tie the goat to your saddle . 
you cant hit an opponents hand to get the goat from him . 
if those rules sound a little odd ,  consider them a quick lesson in buzkashi . 
those are not all the rules ,  of course ,  but those familiar with the rugged game recognise them as good sportsmanship . 
buzkashi is one of the oldest traditional games played on the steppes . 
it dates back to genghis khan ,  the mongol warrior whose army swept across asia in the 13t century . 
the game is still played in northern afghanistan and by afghan refugees in many parts of pakistan ,  as well as throughout central asia . 
it draws thousands of fans and in pakistan is popular in the provinces of maimana ,  mazar-i-sharif ,  and kataghan . 
as a rule ,  women are forbidden to watch it . 
mostly buzkashi is played in winter ,  because it is the agricultural slack season and horses and riders can play then without overheating ,  said zahir hussain serwari ,  general secretary of the pakistan buzkashi federation . 
whatever its form and occasion ,  buzkashi depends on sponsorship for the winning horses and riders and for the ceremonial event in which buzkashi is played . 
in the traditional ,  rural perspective of northern afghanistan and in pakistan where buzkashi is played ,  both types of sponsorship are the realm of tribal chiefs - men of social ,  economic ,  and political importance who constitute the informal and ever-shifting ruling elite of local life . 
the tribal chiefs own the horses whose bloodlines they proudly chronicle and whose success in buzkashi contributes to owner status . 
the tribal chiefs and celebrities of areas likewise employ special riders - called chapandaz - for their horses . 
most important is their sponsorship of the festive events at which buzkashi is traditionally played . 
for buzkashi the carcass of an animal is used . 
goats are preferred ,  but small calves will do if goats are in short supply ,  hussain serwari said . 
before a buzkashi match starts ,  the players drench a carcass in cold water for at least <num>24</num>  hours . 
this is done so the carcass will remain intact and not be torn to pieces as hundreds of chapandaz compete to grab and carry the carcass to the winning circle ,  hussain added . 
hajji ali ahmed ,  a well-known buzkashi player ,  told central asia online ,  the buzkashi horses are bred for the game and have special qualities . 
if the chapandaz falls off his horse during the game ,  the horse halts in an all-pervasive cloud of dust . 
those who train buzkashi horses feed them dry fruits and butter at regular intervals ,  along with their normal diet of oats and barley ,  he added . 
buzkashi is a very popular game among the south central asians ,  such as the pashtuns ,  hazaras ,  tajiks ,  uzbeks ,  kyrgyz ,  kazakhs ,  and turkmen ,  said abbas ali ,  a member of the afghan olympic federation . 
in the <num>1950</num>  second  ,  the afghan government promoted buzkashi as a tourist attraction and a symbol of centralised power and national unity ,  ali said . 
there were provincial teams and an annual tournament overseen by the king . 
the soviet-installed government ended the tournament . 
buzkashi players train intensively for years . 
many of the seasoned competitors are over <num>35</num>  years old ,  he said . 
playing properly requires trained horses ,  ali said . 
such a horse can be purchased today for us <num>15,000</num>  $  to <num>20,000</num>  $  .
he said ,  this sport was transferred to pakistan by afghan refugees and in the taliban era ,  when it was played primarily in the northern provinces of afghanistan . 
when you read the rules and history of this game ,  it appeals to the typical spectator .

 [ bryn lennon / getty images ] 
amsterdam - after a two-year hiatus ,  alexander vinokourov is back riding high professionally - only this time ,  its the high of success . 
after being linked to a doping scandal in the <num>2007</num>  tour de france ,  vinokourov served a one-year suspension from cycling . 
then he took a one-year retirement . 
vinokourov never admitted to using epo ,  a drug that increases the production of red blood cells ,  or any other performance-enhancing drugs . 
thats why i wanted to come back ,  to show what i am able to do . 
that wont prevent me from aiming to win a stage ,  if possible ,  said vinokourov ,  who has won three individual stages of the tour . 
but alberto knows that ill never try to double-cross him . 
i promised to help him win the tour de france ,  and i will keep it . 
that means vinokourov will be contadors lieutenant in the mountain stages of the tour . 
oscar pereiro ,  benjamin noval ,  david de la fuente ,  enrico gasparotto and maxim iglinskiy will be the others who will lead team astanas point man up the mountains . 
when i started the morning on my bike ,  i tried to imagine that i had a competition the following week . 
that was my motivation even if it was all fictional ,  vinokourov said . 
it hasnt always been easy ,  but i held out . 
this is also why i had no problem quickly finding the rhythm of the competition in august <num>2009</num>  when i came back . 
i kept the same strength in my legs and my head . 
vinokourov was one of the creators of team astana in <num>2006</num>  .
and i plan to continue  ( my involvement with the team )  as a manager because i want to help my country ,  kazakhstan ,  develop in international cycling ,  he said .

asia cup opens with pakistan against sri lanka june <num>15</num> 
pakistani cricket players stretch during a june <num>14</num>  practice at the rangiri dambulla international cricket stadium in dambulla ,  sri lanka . 
the four-nation asia cup will be played in sri lanka june <num>15</num>  - <num>24</num>  .
peshawar -- with all-rounder shoaib malik and speedster shoaib akhtar on board ,  national team captain shahid afridi says his team stands a chance to win crickets asia cup ,  which starts june <num>15</num>  in sri lanka . 
pakistans team will put up a fighting performance and this team cannot be written off ,  afridi said before leaving for colombo to face sri lanka in the tournaments opening match . 
india and bangladesh are the two remaining teams competing for the cup . 
the last time pakistan won the asia cup was in <num>2000</num>  in bangladesh . 
asia is the only continent with enough cricket teams to field a proper tournament . 
the asian cricket council approved the idea of the asia cup in <num>1983</num>  .
in <num>1984</num>  , the first edition was introduced in sharjah . 
india and sri lanka have won the cup four times ,  while pakistan has won just once . 
sri lanka is the only team to participate in every asia cup . 
fresh from icc t-20 world cup in the west indies ,  where they could not defend the title ,  national selectors recalled fast bowler akhtar and all-rounder malik to strengthen the team . 
malik had been suspended for breaching discipline codes during pakistan teams tour australia last year . 
however ,  the pakistan cricket board reversed its decision to allow him to rejoin the team . 
the national selector ,  mohsin khan ,  considered akhtar for the team to add speed to the bowling attack of pakistan . 
the asia cup ,  however ,  might be a last-gasp chance for the veteran akhtar to revive his chequered career . 
afridi said his team has a chance to win the cup ,  but what concerns him more is the issue of discipline among the team-mates . 
the pakistan team looks balanced in the bowling and batting departments . 
in the bowling department ,  muhammad asif ,  abdul razzak and muhammad aamer will join speedster akhtar to challenge any strong batting line-up ,  while specialist spinners saeed ajmal and abdur rehman can spin the ball to deceive any top-class batsman . 
as tensions rise ,  food prices follow

the kabul resident works more than <num>12</num>  hours a day ,  six days a week ,  but says he cant keep up with spiralling food costs . 
omari ,  <num>44</num>  , says he has to pay <num>250</num>  afghanis  ( <num>5.00</num>  $   [ usd ]  )  to buy <num>7</num>  kg of flour every other day . 
i work from <num>6</num>  oclock in the morning to <num>7</num>  or <num>8</num>  at night ,  but these days im not able to afford my expenses . 
everything has gotten two or three times more  [ expensive ]  in the bazaar ,  he says . 
omari has five children ,  all in local schools in kabul ,  and now fears he cannot provide for his family . 
in the last six months ,  living costs in afghanistan have risen sharply . 
the rapid increase in commodity prices worldwide ,  combined with a lack of security ,  direct and indirect taxes on imports ,  and bribes and government corruption have hit afghans particularly hard . 
add increased unrest with pakistan ,  through which most imports come ,  and afghanistan is experiencing an economic crisis . 
afghan customs officials in torkham ,  on the afghanistan side of the afghan-pakistan border ,  say pakistan has taken this action because it is afraid that during the unrest in their own country they will face food shortages and famine . 
he said there has also been a <num>10</num>  $  rise for a <num>16</num>  kg container of pakistani oil and a <num>14</num>  $  increase in the cost of a <num>50</num>  kg bag of pakistani rice . 
afghanistan provides its needs mostly from pakistan and other neighbouring countries . 
if the situation is not good in pakistan ,  or they dont let anything be exported into afghanistan ,  living costs increase quickly ,  said mulahkhil . 
but ghulam rabani haqiqat yab ,  head of the census and marketing department in the ministry of agriculture ,  says that pakistan is not the only reason that living costs in afghanistan have gone up . 
in <num>2007</num>  , the ministry of agriculture in kabul announced that afghan farmers grew more than <num>90</num>  percent of the cereals needed for domestic consumption . 
rabani believes if afghanistan can become self-sufficient in grains ,  then the prices will drop again . 
if you look at prices in afghanistan now compared to last year ,  a loaf of bread has doubled in price ,  a <num>7</num>  kg bags of wheat is up from <num>120</num>  afghanis to <num>240</num>  afghanis ;  a litre of petrol from <num>34</num>  afghanis to <num>60</num>  afghanis . 
poppy cultivation in afghanistan decreases
head of the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  office on drugs and crime ,  antonio maria costa speaks in kabul on <abbr>aug.</abbr> 
opium production in afghanistan has fallen from the record high reached last year ,  but officials warned that there is no room for complacency . 
poppy cultivation fell <num>19</num>  percent to <num>157,000</num>  hectares in <num>2008</num>  , down from <num>193,000</num>  hectares last year ,  according to a joint report compiled by the afghan ministry of counter narcotics  ( mcn )  and the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  office on drugs and crime  ( unodc )  . 
production also fell ,  but less markedly ,  declining <num>6</num>  percent to <num>7,700</num>  tonnes . 
the money will be spent on building two water dams and a small hydro-electric power station . 
judging from the fact that there are now <num>18</num>  opium-free provinces ,  a growing number of governors are really playing by the rule book ,  antonio maria costa ,  the head of unodc ,  said in an interview with reuters news agency . 
a less encouraging explanation for the drop in production was the weather ,  especially in the north and north-west where the poppy crop failed due to drought . 
the income ratio of opium to wheat shrank from <num>10</num>  : <num>1</num>  in <num>2007</num>  to <num>3</num>  : <num>1</num>  in <num>2008</num>  .
poppy cultivation is now limited to seven provinces in the south and south-east . 
helmand ,  kandahar ,  uruzgan ,  zabul ,  farah and nimroz now account for <num>98</num>  percent of afghanistans opium cultivation . 
this underlines the link between drugs and insurgency . 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  military stated earlier this year that suicide bombings were up <num>27</num>  percent in <num>2007</num>  compared with <num>2006</num>  .
their occurrence has rocketed <num>600</num>  percent since <num>2005</num>  .
high cultivation levels are concentrated in the unstable south of the country . 
but he added ,  we are in this for the long haul . 
the <abbr>u.k.</abbr>  is the lead nation of afghanistans counter drugs strategy . 
malloch-brown urged the international community once again to provide support to afghanistan . 
old urban heritage remembered and restored
afghanistan is home to some of the worlds most ancient sites . 
the once famous covered roof bazaar of tashqurghan in samangan province is one of the countrys many treasures . 
it was built during the <num>1800</num>  second  to serve as a major trading centre for merchants crossing from india into central asia . 
for over a century ,  it served as one the areas main markets until it was destroyed in the early <num>1980</num>  second  during the soviet invasion . 
the tashqurghan :  an afghan heritage lost ? 
and for the young generation of afghans ,  it has been a chance for them to get know their countrys rich history that has been rattled by nearly three decades of fighting . 
i hope for continued peace so afghanistan can revive what once was ,  said asim shah ,  a <num>15</num> -year-old student who came to see the exhibition . 
kabul museum general director omara khan masoudi explained ,  the government of holland wants to work alongside the afghan government to rebuild the <num>1,000</num>  shop bazaar in its old fashion . 
it will be a great economic improvement giving locals the opportunity to work and attracting thousands of afghan and foreign visitors . 
ahmad shah is one of the many visitors who came to look at the museums photographic display of the old bazaar . 
these pictures show what we were in the past . 
we can see how we once were ,  living in such grand conditions compared to today ,  he said . 
the exhibition at the kabul museum has helped the public remember one of the countrys most famous markets and rally support for it to be rebuilt . 
in addition to restoring the citys traditional bazaar ,  the afghan ministry of information and culture also has plans to build a regional museum in the bagh-e jehan nama palace in tashqurghan . 
kyrgyz interior ministry dissolves ninth department
bishkek - new authorities have abolished the ninth department ,  accusing its staff of gathering compromising information on the opposition . 
officially ,  the interior ministry department was assigned to fight religious extremism and illegal immigration ,  but acting interior minister bolot sher accused them of going beyond that mission . 
tracking opposition journalists and spying on members of the opposition were both their  ( ninth department personnels )  jobs ,  sher told central asia online . 
now we are determining to what extent they may be implicated in attacks on journalists last year . 
the department only duplicated the state national security service  ( snss ) s functions ,  analysts said . 
the fight against terrorism is the special services prerogative . 
the ninth department operated for four years and its staff attended dozens of seminars and workshops ,  including osce and collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  sessions . 
no one thought about the fact that real professionals who worked according to western models worked there . 
the snss does not have that calibre of people . 
ngos have criticized shers decision . 
i often saw them in the courtroom . 
i think that the compromising information leaked on omurbek tekebayev and others under  ( kurmanbek )  bakiyev was the work of the ninth department . 
it fought extremism only on paper and in workshops . 
the country faces no present threat of religious terrorism ,  state committee for religious affairs chairman kanybek osmonaliyev said . 
the south is ablaze ,  he said . 
extremists … are not going to attack the country at such a time . 
if we are going to regret the loss of the mias ninth department ,  it will be much later . 
but another scholar disputed that view . 
there was and always will be a threat of extremism ,  said leonid bondarets ,  a regional security analyst at the kyrgyz-russian slavic university . 
so ,  follow through on what you say . 
some security officials had expressed hopes that the department would be reorganised ,  not dissolved . 
bakyt dubanayev ,  who works in the mias anti-terrorist centre ,  said he is sorry to lose such valuable staff . 
the exact number of department employees is a state secret . 
the department handled illegal immigration ,  said aigul ryskulova ,  a former labour ,  employment and migration minister now serving as the interim governments special representative on refugee matters in the south . 
now there is no one in the special services dealing with it ,  she said . 
the times are confused ,  and this is an important issue . 
it seems to me that we have lost important rear-echelon services . 
in addition to russia and china ,  the shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  includes states from central asia ,  namely ,  uzbekistan ,  tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  and kazakhstan . 
to this end ,  she continues ,  and in order to coordinate actions concerning the extradition of suspects ,  in <num>2004</num>  the sco created the regional anti-terrorist structure . 
its main task is to help the intelligence services in the member countries to avoid the obstacles created by national laws and the standards of international law in the extradition of suspects . 
the greatest obstacle is the extradition procedure ,  which proposes that the decision on extraditing a person be made at the level of the prosecutor general . 
the sco states have gone a long way in formulating this new system . 
thus ,  the shanghai convention allows official bodies of signatory countries  ( for example ,  the intelligence services of uzbekistan or china )  to request that the laws of their respective country be applied on the territory of ,  for example ,  russia . 
this applies to cases in which the essential elements of a crime that fall within the purview of the specific provenance of the authorities in another state are not found in russian law . 
another obstacle confronted by intelligence services wishing to extradite a citizen of their own country from a neighbouring state is refugee status . 
this is what has often saved uzbeks and tajiks prosecuted in their own countries for their religious convictions or opposition activities . 
the programme envisions a series of measures to increase the legal awareness of farmers and provide communication channels and information resources to them . 
the proposal concedes that the cotton industry ,  one of tajikistan's economic pillars ,  has fallen into a deep financial crisis that threatens the country's overall economic development  ( thirty-four regions of the country are cotton growing areas )  . 
cotton growers' debt burden to investors totals more than <num>500</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  ,  while debt to state coffers and non-budgetary foundations hovers around <num>90</num>  $  million . 
these debts have been piling up for years through the practice of giving commodity credits to farmers . 
before this year ,  these credits were allocated to cotton growers by tajik futures traders acting as mediators between farmers and foreign investors . 
the collective farms received material and technical assistance for cotton growing ,  but misused their resources . 
and when the time came to restructure the collective farms into freeheld farms ,  these debts were automatically transferred to the newly restructured farms . 
also ,  when futures traders started to supply credit to the farms ,  they did not lend them real money . 
instead ,  they supplied the growers with seeds ,  mineral fertilizer and fuel at <num>200</num> -<num>250</num>  percent the actual market price ,  "  explains professor khodzhimakhmad umarov ,  head specialist of tajikistan's institute for economic research . 
according to umarov ,  the farmers cannot take their harvested cotton to market because they are forced to hand their crop to a local processor who is in no hurry to give them money . 
an earlier study commissioned by the independent commission and conducted by the national association of managers and marketers of tajikistan shows that the <num>2006</num>  debt burden for each farm averaged <num>50,000</num>  $  .
annual interest on these debts has snowballed ,  making cotton growing today a losing proposition for the overwhelming majority of tajikistan's farmers . 
murodov states that the new strategy envisions the creation of a steering committee and interdepartmental coordinating commissions in each of the country's regions . 
these structures will be charged not only with keeping the people informed of government decisions ,  but also with collecting feedback from farmers . 
citizens of pakistans poorest province hope for improvement
drinking water ,  such as this woman consumes in balochistan ,  is in scarce supply in that part of pakistan . 
balochistan remains one of pakistans least developed provinces with high rates of infant and maternal mortality ,  poverty ,  illiteracy and malnutrition . 
hundreds of baloch citizens ,  who often feel ignored by pakistans central government ,  have rallied to get the attention of the new administration . 
pakistan activist syed mirza said much must be done by the new government to help develop the province which has long been isolated from the rest of the country . 
under article <num>25</num>  of pakistans constitution ,  women are entitled to a number of economic and social rights ,  such as rights to food ,  social security ,  housing ,  education ,  an adequate standard of living and healthcare . 
such policies must be translated into action to help empower the people of province and allow the new government to gain support here ,  he said . 
balochistan has the highest infant and maternal mortality ratio in pakistan . 
for example ,  in karachi the maternal mortality ratio is <num>281</num>  per <num>100,000</num>  live births while in rural balochistan its <num>673</num>  .
pakistan health officer ali aziz said ,  the maternal mortality ratio is <num>650</num>  per <num>100,000</num>  live births in balochistan - nearly two times pakistans national average . 
he added that thousands of maternal deaths that occur each year could be avoided if there was safe drinking water . 
the health expert also cited poor sanitation as one of the major causes of infant and maternal mortality in the province . 
the baloch womens panel has organised a number of protests and rallies to raise attention to inequality in their province . 
one of their key missions is to highlight the disparity that exists in education . 
while just <num>27</num>  percent of students in the province go on to higher education ,  the figure is <num>64</num>  percent in punjab . 
the state bank of pakistan has also released figures revealing that balochistan and nwfp have the highest rate of female unemployment . 
the baloch womens panel has advocated for more vocational training centres in their province . 
while <num>111</num>  womens vocational and training centres exist in punjab ,  there is just one in balochistan . 
the training centres in punjab have enabled women to become more capable and confident in their ability to qualify for the job market . 
it should be the priority of the government to provide such opportunities countrywide . 
the people of pakistan demanded that the old leadership go and we now have hopes that our new leaders will listen ,  said womens right activist sumaira sodha . 
today the local people of balochistan are pushing for political empowerment and demanding clean drinking water ,  electricity ,  education ,  basic health facilities ,  roads and infrastructure . 
the new government in pakistan has committed to uniting the country and we hope to see more efforts to unite balochistan with the rest of pakistan ,  said sodha . 
afghan media gains popularity ,  faces new challenges

after its initial success ,  the media in afghanistan is facing new challenges . 
several independent media outlets have found difficulty sustaining operations after donor communities have gone . 
many have taken funds from local political parties in order to help sustain their operations . 
while president hamid karzai was a major supporter in developing a free media in afghanistan ,  since the formation of the parliament in <num>2005</num>  , afghan officials have been at odds over how freedom of the media should be defined . 
afghan intelligence chief amrullah saleh speaks to the media after a press conference .

many believe the creation of a public broadcasting service could help support local stations and educational programming . 
afghanistans state run rta could potentially be transformed into a public broadcasting service similar to western countries . 
the corporation is run by the bbc trust with a charter pledging that it remain free from both political and commercial influence and answer only to its viewers and listeners . 
independent media has played a great role in parliamentary and presidential elections . 
often times ,  journalists cannot express their own ideas without threats from influential warlords who have their own armed groups ,   [ that ]  can create lots of problems for people ,  he adds . 
a strong public service broadcaster could help local stations stay independent and make them less vulnerable to the pressures put on them by local political parties . 
afghan journalists also say there is a need for advanced training institutions . 
while a lot of money was spent on teaching afghans basic journalism skills ,  the country still lacks longer term training programmes . 
its really hard to find professional journalists because its such a new thing in afghanistan ,  says khaleeq ahmed ,  former deputy director of communication and spokesman for international affairs in president karzais administration . 
while afghan journalists are finding their place in society ,  tensions between some politicians in the democratically elected afghan government and the independent media continue to grow . 
the ministry of culture recently banned indian soap operas from airing in afghanistan ,  deeming them against islamic culture . 
female education remains a top priority
nasima shah ,  who teaches at a girls school in kabul ,  remembers when the taliban took over the city . 
all girls were told they had to leave the schools and only boys were allowed to attend . 
women were no longer allowed to teach ,  not even from their homes ,  she said . 
her husband ,  ashraf shah ,  said that such behaviour was neither islamic nor part of afghan culture . 
as a result ,  millions of afghans fled the country looking for better educational opportunities for their children elsewhere . 
after the fall of the taliban ,  president hamid karzai took power and committed to reopening schools for both boys and girls . 
nasima returned to kabul and once again began teaching . 
she said that while the abundance of girls school is high ,  it is still a challenge to help afghan women who were denied an education under the taliban . 
the ministry of education and the ministry of womens affairs are working to create educational and vocational opportunities for women aged <num>17</num>  and older . 
in baghlan province ,  for example ,  over <num>200</num>  women recently took part in computer and english classes . 
maneja attended the programme and said ,  i have learned three microsoft office programmes and continue to see my english improve as i attend language classes . 
i could not afford private school fees and the ministry of womens affairs has given many women an opportunity to attend classes for free ,  she said . 
vocational schools are being run across the country to give women the opportunity to generate income . 
in more conservative areas where women do not feel comfortable leaving their homes ,  teachers have gone door to door in many communities to provide literacy classes and vocational training . 
the afghan ministry of education is not only in support of such initiatives ,  but has also responded to the recent food crisis by raising wages for teachers . 
while educational opportunities have improved tremendously for both girls and boys in afghanistan ,  the rise in food prices made it difficult for teachers to survive . 
but the government showed their appreciation for the role teachers play in society and raised our wages ,  said nasima . 
kyrgyzstan rids itself of uzbek refugees
on august <num>14</num>  , a group of uzbek asylum seekers reported that the republic of kyrgyzstan state committee for migration and employment had refused their request for an extension of the period of registration that would give them the right to legally remain in kyrgyzstan until their application for refugee status had been reviewed by the un high commissioner for refugees  ( unhcr )  . 
during the personal review process of a case ,  which may take several months ,  the period of registration may be extended for up to one year by the state committee for migration and employment . 
however ,  according to individual reports ,  the kyrgyz authorities suddenly started to refuse uzbeks who had applied for an extension in order to legally remain on the countrys territory . 
when a refugees period of registration expires ,  he or she is vulnerable to all kinds of unpleasantness ,  including problems with the authorities and law enforcement agencies . 
officials of the migration department refused to discuss the situation on the telephone . 
anna ni ,  national counsellor on refugee rights in the unhcr ,  told nbca that she had been unable to get an exhaustive response on this problem from those same migration officials . 
but we nevertheless hope that after negotiations  ( with the kyrgyz authorities )  this complicated situation may be resolved . 
however ,  vitaliy ponomarev ,  the head of the central asian project of the memorial public foundation in moscow ,  sees nothing strange in the fact that the kyrgyz authorities have started to refuse extensions to uzbek refugees ,  and he suggests that official bishkek is drawing on the experience of the russian federal migration service ,  which assumed a similar position late last year . 
but this is not grounds for fearing that uzbek refugees will soon be deported . 
this is quite logical since ,  for all these years in kyrgyzstan ,  it has been the practice to carry out the registration whenever an application is received . 
since the may <num>2005</num>  events ,  when uzbekistans government troops fired on demonstrators in the city of andizhan in the east of the country ,  a stream of refugees has been pouring into neighbouring kyrgyzstan . 
some of them have managed to obtain legal status ,  about <num>400</num>  have gone to europe ,  the united states ,  and canada ,  but many still remain in kyrgyzstan and are waiting to learn their fates . 
however ,  for them this is an alarming moment . 
accepted for military service but given no housing support
speakers at the press conference confirmed that in almaty alone <num>33</num>  retired military personnel are in possession of court orders obliging the ministry of defence to provide them with living accommodation . 
turkmen president gurbanguly berdymukhammedov .

turkmen president gurbanguly berdymukhammedov has shaken up the way in which the countrys oil and gas resources are managed and has carried out a major overhaul of the management of the fuel and energy sector ,  russian daily vremya novostyei reported today . 
previously all key decisions were taken by berdymukhammedov and his immediate entourage ,  but the government and its ministries had wide-ranging powers . 
now the cabinet ,  including its influential deputy chairman for the fuel and energy sector ,  tachberdy tagiyev  ( who is not a direct protege of the president )  ,  has effectively been sidelined from the decision-making process . 
yagshygeldy kakayev ,  who since february <num>2007</num>  has headed the turkmengaz state company ,  has been put in charge of the newly-created state agency . 
for more than a decade he was a lowly head of department within the ministry of the oil and gas industry during saparmurat niyazovs presidency . 
kakayevs promotion last year was on the basis of a six-month trial period . 
it now appears that he not only passed the trial ,  but also proved his unconditional loyalty to the countrys new president ,  vremya novostyei reports . 
<num>6</num>  , <num>2005</num>  , the new law will apply equally to both national and foreign oil and gas companies and will also make it possible to extend the validity of mining licences from <num>25</num>  years to <num>35</num>  years . 
this will have a major impact on the exploitation of new deposits requiring considerable investment in exploratory works and the creation of the necessary industrial infrastructures ,  such as the oil and gas deposits in the turkmen section of the caspian sea ,  the state information agency reported . 
however ,  to date ashgabat has failed to find any investors willing to plough money into prospecting for and exploiting the probable reserves of turkmenistans section of the caspian sea shelf . 
gazprom chairman alexei miller recently had to sign an agreement with berdymukhammedov regarding an interest-free loan to finance the construction of the turkmen stretch of the caspian coastal pipeline and development of the shelf ,  according to a russian newspaper . 
the tajikistan ministry of education has proposed the introduction of <num>11</num>  years of compulsory education in the country . 
tajikistan deputy ministry of education irina karimova ,  participating in the work of a round table on the problem of girls education in the republic ,  spoke to the prima-news information agency about this on september <num>4</num>  .
this proposal has already been endorsed by the head of state ,  karimova stated . 
according to her ,  this step will encourage an increase in the level of education as a whole and particularly for girls . 
we are in the process of drafting amendments to the applicable laws ,  karimova stated . 
specialists believe that in order to address the lack of gender balance and increase access to education it is necessary to conduct continuous educational work in local communities and with parents ,  and to better coordinate actions taken by state agencies ,  local authorities and civil sector institutions as well . 
airplane crashes in kyrgyzstan ,  <num>68</num>  killed
tragedy struck on august <num>24</num>  near bishkek's manas airport when a passenger boeing <num>737</num>  jet crashed upon takeoff . 
according to the latest information ,  the accident claimed <num>68</num>  lives ;  <num>22</num>  people were rescued from the crash site . 
bishkek's hospitals are caring for <num>18</num>  victims ,  eight of whom are in critical condition ,  kyrgyzstan's health minister marat mambetov told journalists . 
citing mambetov ,  ria novosti reported that <num>14</num>  kyrgyz citizens and <num>11</num>  iranians were receiving medical treatment . 
the aircraft's black boxes were recovered at the crash site and delivered to the international aviation committee ,  according to kyrgyzstan's civil aviation department . 
there was no evidence of technical malfunction ,  and authorities have struck terrorist activity from the list of scenarios that could have brought down the aircraft . 
an emergency response centre set up by the country's emergencies ministry issued updated figures on the tragedy . 
the boeing <num>737</num>  , en-route from bishkek to tehran ,  was carrying the citizens of six countries aboard :  <num>24</num>  kyrgyz citizens ,  <num>52</num>  iranian citizens ,  one citizen each from the countries of turkey and china ,  two canadians ,  and three kazakh citizens . 
among the plane's passengers were two lawmakers from the bishkek municipal council ,  bilal chynybayev and bakhtiyar kadyrov . 
also on board the plane was kyrgyzstan's national youth volleyball team ,  comprised of <num>17</num>  athletes . 
cnn has reported that seven of the seventeen-member youth team survived the crash . 
the flight was operated by the iranian company aseman airlines ,  while the crew was from the kyrgyzstan airline itek air ,  which also owned the aircraft .

in the ensuing crisis ,  the plane's crew requested return to the airport for an emergency landing ,  according to mamytov . 
the aircraft never made it back to the airport . 
at <num>20</num>  : <num>43</num>  the plane crash-landed near the village of zhany-zher in kyrgyzstan's sokuluk region . 
the force of the plane's collision with the ground caused the craft to break up and burn . 
according to mamytova ,  a commission has been formed to investigate the tragedy ,  even though the cause is believed to have been technical failure . 
among the possible scenarios being studied are malfunctions in the engines or control systems . 
two hours before the tragedy ,  the plane returned without incident from moscow ,  after which it underwent pre-flight check-ups and was assigned a fresh crew for the bishkek-tehran leg . 
during the emergency meeting of kygryzstan's administration ,  an itek air spokesperson confirmed that the airplane's diagnostics were all normal . 
the kyrgyz government has formed a commission ,  headed by prime minister igor chudinov ,  to investigate the causes of the boeing 737's crash . 
despite the tragedy ,  the manas airport continues to operate normally . 
authorities in bishkek deny that terrorists could have brought down the boeing <num>737</num>  .
 " there is no question that terrorism played no role in the crash ,  "  transportation minister nurlan sulaymanov stated . 
according to the minister ,   " there is no preliminary evidence to suggest that a terrorist attack could have taken place on board the airplane .  " 
the transportation minister also announced that kyrgyzstan's general prosecutor's office has opened a criminal case on the forced landing of the plane and the subsequent fire on board that caused the deaths of passengers . 
the minister stated that the craft's black boxes had been recovered from the crash site and would be used as evidence in the criminal trial . 
the boeing <num>737</num>  is the most popular narrow-body passenger jet in the world . 
the boeing corporation has been manufacturing the aircraft since <num>1967</num>  .
the <num>737</num>  has attained such widespread use that an average of <num>1,250</num>  of these aircraft are in the air at any moment ,  with a <num>737</num>  taking off and landing every five seconds . 
kyrgyzstan's leadership has declared august <num>26</num>  a national day of mourning . 
caspian seals on the brink of extinction
the boat takes supplies to oil rigs . 
along the ice canal you can see compact groups of female seals with their pups . 
the behaviour of over <num>400</num>  seals was studied . 
the world bank participated in the financing of this project ,  thereby flagrantly breaching its own procedures . 
and if it remains indifferent to the fate of a thousand people who were made hostage to the oil business ,  then it is hardly likely to be sensitive to the fate of the caspian seal . 
the aim of the world bank is to reduce the political and financial risks of oil companies having to pay environmental fines .

inflation in uzbekistan

<num>22</num>   ( photo by maxim marmur / afp / getty images ) 
<num>2</num> -inflation in uzbekistan has become both a permanent phenomenon and a predictable cyclical recurrence ,  writes the internet site fergana . ru .  while creeping price increases occur continuously ,  twice a year an especially strong surge occurs when within a month ,  the cost of goods and services increases by <num>10</num>  to <num>20</num>  percent or more . 
the cause is the so-called presidential increase in wages ,  pensions ,  allowances and social benefits ,  which are also usually between <num>15</num>  and <num>20</num>  percent . 
this year ,  such increases occurred in april ,  following a raise in wages to government employees and pensions of <num>12</num>  percent and in september of <num>20</num>  percent for a total of <num>34</num>  percent over the first ten months of <num>2008</num>  .
the minimum wage increased from <num>18,630</num>  to <num>25,040</num>  sum ,  and the level of minimum pension and benefits to invalids from childhood increased from <num>36,900</num>  to <num>49,600</num>  sum during that period . 
simultaneously with these increases prices headed upwards . 
on october <num>1</num>  , tariffs on central heating and hot water increased <num>15</num>  percent and the cost for housing services went up <num>10</num>  percent . 
prices for food ,  public transportation and public services increased by similar rates . 
the long-standing history of observations of the jumps in inflation in uzbekistan attest to the fact that each increase in wages and social benefits is used by authorities as a pretext for an increase in tariffs ,  tax and customs rates ,  prices for petrol and other types of solely-supplied goods and services .

local residents have built a new waiting room for females ,  which has helped increase the number of people travelling to the clinic . 
the waiting room not only benefits the patients ,  but also the clinic staff who use the rooms for meetings . 
it can also be used to address large groups during public information campaigns . 
we had already built a wall around the clinic and ,  when it was completed ,  the clinic staff asked us to build a waiting room . 
the wall has so far been hugely beneficial both for staff and patients . 
we hope that everyone will benefit just as much from the waiting room ,  says laszlo fekete ,  a hungarian ,  who is deputy commander of the prt . 
provincial shura leader narya hamidi says she is grateful to local residents who helped with the construction and was impressed with prt efforts to improve health services in the province .

free media and the people
pakistans new government has moved to overturn a series of draconian gagging laws imposed on the countrys media last year . 
and they have ordered an urgent enquiry into claims journalists were tortured by agents of the state . 
president pervez musharraf banned live television broadcasts and outlawed any criticism of his regime when he declared emergency rule in november . 
the amendments will remove the entire apparatus of restrictions imposed on the press she said . 
 " we will put our own house in order and we will allow the press to broadcast not just live telecast ,  but all that they feel fit to broadcast .  " 
rahman told reporters it was the new government's aim to restore and safeguard the freedom of pakistan's prolific news media . 
she said ,   " on completion of the formalities ,  it will become a law .  " 
under the emergency legislation ,  pemra was given authority to fine broadcasters up to <num>96,000</num>  €  .
the amendment will cut the maximum penalty to <num>96</num>  €  .
it also limits pemra's powers to imprison broadcasters ,  reporters and media owners . 
rahman condemned attacks on media professionals ,  and she said the government was investigating reports of torture and violence against journalists . 
she also promised new measures to safeguard reporters and assured that provisions will be made to care for the families of journalists killed in action . 
she said ,   " we will also make sure that this process is made transparent as the welfare of journalists is part of our agenda . 
 "  musharraf tried to gag the media in the wake of popular unrest following his decision to sack the country's chief justice iftikhar mohammad chaudhry . 
last month ,  police stormed a television station in the midst of popular riots . 
officers fired tear gas at the channel's employees after their editors refused to stop broadcasting footage of demonstrations .

the programme is designed to cut the number of unwarranted or harassing official checks and inspections carried out by authorities ,  and to raise awareness of the legal rights of businessmen . 
one of its main goals is to tackle government corruption with support from usaid . 
the kolokol programme will register complaints from businesspeople ,  which will be dealt with by a special group including ministry officials ,  trade and business associations ,  and a film crew ,  the minister of economic development and trade ,  akylbek zhaparov said . 
according to figures released by the ministry ,  in <num>2007</num>  the authorities made a total of <num>47,400</num>  compliance checks ,  four percent lower than the figure for <num>2006</num>  .

sadiq zaidi ,  a former energy development advisor at the asian development bank ,  asserted that pakistan will address the crisis and move in the right direction . 
zaidi suggests that pakistan use its untapped resources to tackle its energy crisis . 
there are five dams in pakistan that can generate <num>20,000</num>  mw . 
the country has tremendous energy production potential ,  he says . 
as an example zaidi points to india whose development of its renewable energy sector led to an increase in investment in the countrys wind energy . 
in order for pakistan to reach its full potential in energy ,  zaidi says ,  the government must share its vision with provincial leaders and give them ownership in renewable energy projects .

information about uzbekistan appears in the foreign press regularly ,  which means that there are people who transmit it out of the country ,  said freelance journalist kudrat akhunov . 
afghanistans media faces growth and challenge
afghani newspaper
afghanistans media has played a critical role in helping unite the war-shattered country . 
during the harsh taliban regime ,  television was banned and the country had just one state run radio station and newspaper . 
rather than airing a variety of radio shows ,  the station conveyed only religious programming . 
newspapers were limited in number and with literacy rates of <num>29</num>  per cent for men and <num>12</num>  per cent for women ,  not the most effective messaging tool . 
a limited number of afghans were able to secretly access international radio stations such as the bbc world service and voice of america . 
after the ousting of the taliban in <num>2001</num>  , an aggressive campaign funded by the international community began in order to help develop an independent media in the newly democratic afghanistan . 
despite lack of infrastructure and building on the countrys difficult terrain ,  its evolution has been regarded as one of afghanistans great success stories since the fall of the taliban . 
the countrys population of <num>25</num>  million has been divided by social and ethnic lines for decades . 
afghanistans local media has been one the most critical civil society actors bringing together different languages and easing cultural biases . 
it is the first time many afghans have had a unified outlet of people all across the country to exchanging views with one another . 
many television and radio stations for example mix dari and pashto together in radio programming helping to reinforce the countrys two national languages . 
it has also been an important tool for the government to convey public information messages . 
when president hamid karzai first entered power ,  he was regarded by many as the mayor of kabul . 
for many afghans ,  a local ruling warlord has been all they have known . 
afghanistans independent media helped the new government tremendously in being able to do outreach and stay connected to people all across the country . 
despite its initial success ,  afghan media faces many challenges . 
small newspapers and radio stations in smaller provinces have trouble attracting the same level of advertising revenue as those based in the countrys major cities . 
many media outlets have been forced to shut down or take funding from local warlords limiting their freedom of speech . 
increasingly ,  more and more journalists have been under threat from either the taliban or government officials who do not receive criticism well . 
as the country continues to develop its legal structure and policies ,  sustaining a free media that has begun in the country is critical . 
government officials need to stay committed to the idea of a free and open media . 
after decades of war and unrest ,  afghanistans media has already shown itself to be an important tool for recovery . 
tajikistan to establish free economic zones
tajik coat of arms  ( ipd ) 
 " to attract foreign investors ,  without whom the fezs cannot function ,  the state must begin to invest its own resources to create an appropriate infrastructure on fez territory and resolve the problems of providing them with electricity ,  "  said farkhod saidov ,  an expert on economic issues . 
to assist them with their analysis ,  specialists of the tajikistan committee for investment and state property are studying proposals from the china development bank . 
financial groups from arab nations have already expressed interest in investing in a tajik fez . 
two artists ;  one family
the works of rakman and dilber are familiar to art enthusiasts throughout the country . 
both are from lebapsky province in south-eastern turkmenistan ,  and both graduated from the tashkent theatrical and art institute . 
rakhman spent many years teaching students at the lebapsky specialised art school and later directed the childrens art school in turkmenabat . 
dilber worked for the chief artist at the lebapsky state music and drama theatre . 
rakhmans works on display were graphics ,  paintings ,  portraits ,  landscapes ,  and still lifes . 
it is interesting that as different as they are in their artistic expression ,  their art forms harmoniously complemented each other in the ministry of culture exhibition . 
rakhmans brilliant compositions are full of humanism and love of his homeland and its national traditions . 
dilber ,  a set-designer ,  often creates artistic images with her own hands ,  moulding theatrical models and costumes from various materials . 
it is not surprising that ceramics enthral her so much . 
the small terracotta figures have become an extension of her experiences on the path to knowing the reality surrounding her . 
her amusing and kind clay heroes leave warm memories in the hearts of those who see her work .

rasulov said in order to transport cargo outside the country right now a businessman must gather <num>12</num>  kinds of documents ,  which can take <num>30</num>  to <num>40</num>  days . 
according to the asian development bank ,  transport costs in tajikistan constitute up to <num>21</num>  percent of the value of foreign trade ,  the highest percent among central asian nations .

ashgabat - inflation in gas-rich turkmenistan is expected to be between <num>7</num>  and <num>8</num>  percent in <num>2009</num>  , according to government spokespersons .

consumer price index data were released for the first time last summer . 
in a bid to attract foreign investment ,  the new government has eliminated double-entry bookkeeping ,  standardised exchange rates ,  and will revalue turkmenistans national currency ,  the manat ,  in <num>2009</num>  .
it also proclaimed a gradual transition to a market economy in the new constitution .

the global economic crisis will have far less serious consequences for turkmenistan for the simple reason that the country is not integrated into the global economy ,  said michael dennison ,  a global risk analyst with the london-based consultancy firm control risks . 
he added that turkmenistans financial sector is much less developed than those of other former ussr states ,  and global trends are less applicable to it .

<num>12</num>  , the lower house of tajikistan's parliament passed the federal budget of the republic of tajikistan for <num>2009</num>  , which details <num>1.77</num>  $  billion  [ usd ]  in state expenditures . 
finance minister safarali nadzhmidinnov told journalists that ,   " tajikistan's <num>2009</num>  budget puts considerable resources into developing the main pillars of the economy ,  the country's key industries . 
the rogun hydroelectric project ,  considered the largest dam in central asia ,  is slated to receive <num>156</num>  $  million in construction funds . 
for example ,  salary increases in some areas are less than half the amount needed to match rises in the cost of living .  " 
deputy shodi shabdolov of the parliament's committee for energy ,  industry ,  construction and telecommunication ,  believes that  " salaries for secondary school teachers remain inadequate ,  which may lead to a shortage in qualified personnel and a corresponding drop in the quality of education .  " 
according to nadzhmidinnov ,  however ,  social expenditures account for <num>764</num>  $  million of the <num>2009</num>  budget ,  with education receiving <num>320</num>  $  million ,  a figure substantially higher than in the <num>2008</num>  budget .

ukraine investing in tajik energy
the ukrainian company ukrvazhmash will build two hydroelectric plants in the dangarinsky and vakhdatsky regions of tajikistan
ukrvazhmash must prepare feasibility studies by the end of <num>2009</num>  related to building two small hydroelectric plants in the dangarinsky and vakhdatsky regions with capacities of five and <num>50</num>  megawatts ,  respectively ,  first deputy energy and industry minister pulod mukhiddinov said . 
preliminary figures indicate that building the five-megawatt hydroelectric plant in the dangarinsky region alone will cost between <num>6</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  and <num>8</num>  $  million . 
they will become the property of tajikistan after investors recoup their investment and the units turn a profit . 
several other small and medium hydroelectric plants are being built in tajikistan under similar buyout arrangements by kazakh ,  iranian ,  and chinese investors . 
according to tajikistans state investment and property committee ,  this is not the first time ukraine has invested in the countrys energy sector . 
for some time now the ukrainian turbine and mechanical plant has been manufacturing and supplying hydro turbines to modernise the nurek hydroelectric plant ,  the countrys largest . 
president karimov explains why uzbekistan is withdrawing from the eurasian economic community
russias president dmitry medvedev ,  kazakhstans president nursultan nazarbayev  ( l )  and uzbekistans president islam karimov  ( 2nd l )  at the collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  summit last september . 
 ( photo by sergei chirikov ) 
tashkent - in a letter addressed to the eurasian economic community  ( eec )  ,  president islam karimov wrote that uzbekistan will terminate its membership in the organisation . 
he wrote that ,  the main aims and the list of issues for discussion on the eecs agenda largely duplicate the activities of the commonwealth of independent states  ( cis )  and collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  . 
the eurasian economic community is an international organisation with belarus ,  kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  russia ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan as members . 
armenia ,  moldova and ukraine have observer status . 
taking the above into account ,  the uzbek side hereby informs you of the termination of its membership in the eurasian economic community and requests that member countries be notified of this decision ,  the letter concluded . 
the reconstruction will cost <num>66.8</num>  $  million with the government of tajikistan providing the remaining <num>12.2</num>  $  million needed to fully fund the project . 
the head of energy policy at tajikistans energy and industry ministry abdullo kurbonov said equipment is already being replaced at a <num>220</num> -kv outdoor switchgear under a <num>25</num>  million euro loan provided by german development bank kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau . 
the nurek hydroelectric plant with a capacity of <num>3,000</num>  megawatts generates more than <num>70</num>  percent of the electricity in tajikistan . 
the plant also plays a key role in the power supply of kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  turkmenistan and uzbekistan . 
the reservoir is not just important to the hydroelectric plant ;  it also accumulates and supplies water to other central asian countries during the summer to irrigate their crops . 
specialists believe ,  however ,  that the completion of the rogun hydroelectric plant upstream on the vakhsh river will serve as a filter for the reservoir ,  which will solve the mud problem at nurek .

nevertheless ,  the republic must be prepared to respond ,  yakubova emphasised .

kazakhstan plan to tackle financial crisis
approximately <num>40</num>  percent of loans have been affected by the paralysis that has stricken the construction sector and borrowers difficulties in keeping up with mortgage repayments . 
the plan will provide financial support for five sectors of the economy :  the financial sector ,  the property market ,  small and medium-sized enterprises ,  the agricultural sector ,  and industrial and infrastructure projects . 
president nazarbayev stated earlier that <num>4</num>  $  billion will be set aside to support the countrys major banks . 
an additional <num>1</num>  $  billion will be spent on helping small and medium-sized enterprises ,  and the same amount will be used to boost agriculture and implement landmark infrastructure projects .

uzbek army conscripts to face competitive selection process
perks for citizens serving in the army are not a new phenomenon . 
for example ,  only people who have completed their compulsory military service are allowed to work for government institutions . 
in the opinion of military expert ruslan abdullayev ,  the conscription shake-up will reduce the uzbek armys operational capacity . 
since conscription will occur once a year in february and march ,  and conscripts will be dismissed in march and april ,  this means that for at least three months before the new conscripts complete their initial training our army will be at less than full fighting strength ,  he says .

on the eve of the festival ,  islamic and christian leaders of the country extended their good wishes to kazakhs . 
one of the most important of all muslim festivals ,  kurban ait is celebrated on the 70t day after the end of ramadan .

on this day ,  all muslims must keep a tablecloth laden with sweets in their homes ,  since guests can turn up at any moment . 
kazakh religious leaders welcomed the announcement that kurban ait was to be made a public holiday alongside christmas ,  as this now means that everyone in the country can celebrate religious festivals in accordance with traditional rites . 
festive greetings were also expressed to kazakh muslims by the countrys christian orthodox leader metropolitan methodius who said that kazakhstan is currently witnessing a time of reform in the legislation governing religion ,  of further harmonisation of relations between the state and faiths and of improved cross-faith relations . 
we have seen that the spiritual traditions of islam and orthodoxy … call for mutual respect and good neighbourliness ,  which are important for the nation and are needed by modern-day kazakh society ,  methodius said .

are afghan farmers turning their backs on the poppy ? 
wheat is becoming the new cash crop in afghanistan
the heroin trade in afghanistan is taking a big hit as farmers turn onto wheat as worldwide food costs soar . 
farmers are capitalising on higher food costs by growing wheat instead of their traditional poppy crop . 
some say that its the global economic situation that is eradicating poppy production and not the presence of <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  forces . 
he said :  the higher price of commodities has encouraged farmers to switch from poppy cultivation to wheat . 
local farmer haji dawood said this was the first time since he planted wheat that he can now afford to feed his family . 
he said the price of wheat is going up and the price of the poppy has gone down . 
but the taliban stronghold areas remain the key locations for poppy farming ,  most farmers there are still too afraid to start planting wheat ,  he said . 
and the effects of the higher wheat prices are being felt in new york ,  the home of pizza . 
pizzeria owner joe vicari has seen the cost of a <num>50</num>  pound bag of flour rise from <num>16</num>  $   [ usd ]  a bag four weeks ago ,  to <num>37</num>  $  a bag . 
he says that if the cost rises above <num>40</num>  $  a bag then he will have no choice in passing the increase onto his customers . 
at the chicago board of trade  ( cbot )  ,  a bushel ,  <num>60</num>  pounds of wheat ,  now trades for more than <num>1100</num>  $  , more than two-and-1 / <num>2</num>  times what it was just a year ago . 
part of the blame lies on the cost of ethanol . 
huge demand for ethanol ,  bio-fuel ,  has farmers planting more corn to produce the fuel when they could be growing wheat . 
ethanol was competing against wheat for acres in <num>2007</num>  , said joe victor ,  grain analyst with allendale inc . 
poor growing conditions last year also affected the global wheat crop ,  from a winter freeze in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  to droughts in australia and france . 
the united nations announced in <num>2006</num>  that poppy cultivation soared and was expected to increase by almost <num>60</num>  percent in <num>2006</num>  .
according to the united nations ,  afghanistan supplies some <num>92</num>  percent of the worlds supply of opium .

speaking at a conference on border patrol and drug control in central asia in october ,  tajik president emomali rakhmon called on volunteers to coordinate efforts to fight the drug trade from afghanistan . 
due to its geopolitical location and extensive border with afghanistan ,  combined with a harsh climate ,  tajikistan has become one of the main routes for the export of afghan drugs to the cis ,  europe ,  and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  rakhmon said at the time .

tajikistan - a ministry of education initiative supported by president rahmon will require pupils in tajikistan to stay in school for a minimum of <num>11</num>  years . 
this comes in light of education minister abdujabbor rahmonovs statement that just over <num>60</num>  percent of girls who reach year nine complete their educations . 
on average ,  just <num>15</num>  percent of those do go on to study at technical or vocational colleges . 
last year only <num>27,000</num>  girls obtained certificates of secondary education . 
under the old system ,  children had to complete nine years of schooling ,  and many parents did not allow their children to continue their studies beyond that . 
studies carried out by save the children in <num>2007</num>  showed that female pupils and teachers are rare in tajik schools ,  which is attributed to misconceptions regarding the place of women in society . 
in some schools in the religious and conservative north of the country ,  where it widely believed that girls do not have to study ,  there are no female teachers at all . 
most girls in these regions receive an unofficial religious education in private homes and drop out after five or six years . 
factors that prevent them from receiving a full secondary education include large families ,  poverty and worker migration . 
children can often be seen working at markets during school hours . 
the minister of education also revealed that tajikistan still does not have enough schools . 
in dushanbe ,  <num>24</num>  schools operate on a three-shift basis . 
in addition ,  there is currently a shortage of <num>3,600</num>  teachers in the country .

the heritage foundation released its own <num>2008</num>  rankings ,  which assessed freedom of business ,  trade and society in <num>183</num>  countries . 
other indicators contributing to the rankings include fiscal and monetary policy ,  ownership rights ,  and investment climate . 
based on these criteria ,  the report puts kyrgyzstan in 74t place ,  grouped with kazakhstan  ( 83rd )  among the relatively free . 
sixty-seven countries were categorized as mostly not free including tajikistan  ( 122nd )  and uzbekistan  ( 148t )  . 
turkmenistan ,  in 169t place ,  was included on a list of <num>29</num>  countries designated as repressive .

by order of azimova ,  in the autumn of <num>2008</num>  students in grades five through <num>11</num>   ( <num>11</num> -<num>17</num>  years old )  from several schools in the district were mobilised to harvest cotton . 
in tajikistan ,  cotton is a strategically important crop . 
it is the countrys second largest export product ,  after aluminium ,  and is harvested by hand by tajik asiatic peasants . 
in order to gather the harvest in time ,  local authorities often enlist school children and students . 
as a result ,  students are taken away from their studies for prolonged periods . 
in <num>2008</num>  , the ministry of education of tajikistan appealed to the general prosecutors office requesting that this practice be stopped . 
in the same year ,  a ban on enlisting school children to gather the harvest when school is in session was declared . 
independent expert khakim abdulloyev believes that this case will set a good precedent and will help stop this evil practice . 
peshawar - the wheels of justice often move slowly and expensively in pakistan ,  causing public disgust that reputedly strengthens the militancy . 
now khyber pakhtunkhwa is addressing this problem through a musalihatee ,  or reconciliatory committee ,  to restore public confidence and isolate the taliban . 
this dispute resolution method takes pressure off police ,  freeing them to tackle the militancy more efficiently ,  observers and police officials told central asia online . 
it is proving very good for the people ,  the police and ,  above all ,  the government ,  senior police official nisar tanoli said about the alternative mediation method in khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  where the taliban-linked militancy has wrought havoc for the past few years . 
it gives us space to take on the even bigger threat of militancy . 
the restorative justice system appeared in the united states in <num>1970</num>  and spread across the globe . 
its need here became felt when the fight against the militancy pressured the police and courts . 
police stations were flooded with petty cases while bombs were going off outside . 
a lack of judges and court facilities meant disputes took years to settle . 
that caused problems for the poor in particular ,  and the taliban exploited the situation by presenting an alternative system of quicker and cheaper justice . 
the ploy worked initially ,  as pakistanis said ,  the taliban are offering quicker and cheaper justice than the state does . 
that perception among the public set off alarm bells for the government . 
we first introduced the restorative justice system in the hazara region in <num>2008</num>  on an experimental basis ,  and when we got good results ,  this system was slowly and gradually extended to some other districts of pakhtunkhwa province ,  tanoli told central asia online . 
the musalihatee committee network extends to abbottabad ,  mansehra ,  haripur ,  swabi ,  mardan ,  nowshera and peshawar ,  where ,  according to police officials ,  encouraging results are coming in . 
the government eyes expansion of the system to all other districts of the province ;  however ,  logistical problems are causing some delays . 
the nowshera committee earns high praise from khyber pakhtunkhwa chief minister ameer haider hoti and police chief malik naveed khan . 
a neutral committee hears the case when two sides willingly agree to such mediation without involving police or any other legal system . 
this system of dispute resolution is quick and cost-free too ,  said ali gohar ,  head of the ngo just peace international ,  which is working with police to run the alternative system . 
all sorts of disagreements - except terrorism and issues of the countrys defence and security - can be considered . 
it takes up murder or attempted murder cases and family or financial transaction disputes ,  and within less than two weeks ,  the dispute is resolved ,  said mian jamshed ,  a member of the committee in nowshera district . 
a six-month review  ( september <num>2009</num>  to february <num>2010</num>  )  of musalihatees in nowshera underscores the public confidence in the system . 
some <num>1,587</num>  applications - including <num>21</num>  murder cases and <num>19</num>  for attempted murder - were received . 
women welcome the method because they can avoid lodging complaints at police stations ,  where they complain of unwanted attention by some policemen . 
we know women avoid going to the police station … the alternative dispute resolution mechanism ,  however ,  is bringing women to the musalihatees for resolution of their disputes with males ,  gohar said . 
women also are joining the committees ,  empowering themselves . 
we are encouraging women to come forward for resolution of their disputes with their men ,  gohar said . 
the panel settled the matter within a month by awarding two-thirds of the area to khawaray and one-third to dargai . 
land disputes can take generations to settle through regular pakistani courts . 
non-resolution of land quarrels in the swat valley contributed to the rise of taliban-linked militancy ,  when the lower class sought vengeance against long-time landlords . 
militants will find little public support if the state provides quick and cheap justice and improves services ,  observers said . 
turkmen president approves new military doctrine
the president also said that the new military doctrine ,  which focuses on defence matters ,  is aimed at protecting peace and ensuring respect for his countrys territorial integrity . 
the head of the state border service ,  bayram alovov ,  was sacked for losing control over his subordinates and multiple breaches of the law in the departments he presided over . 
alovov has also been demoted . 
unfortunately ,  the mismanagement and various breaches of regulations ,  in particular those concerning fire safety ,  that were occurring within the state border service were not stamped out ,  the president stated in his decision to dismiss the head of the border service . 
yailym berdyev ,  who previously headed the state customs service ,  has now been appointed to the post of defence minister . 
murat islamov ,  the former president of the state anti-narcotics service ,  is to take over as chief of the border service . 
uzbekistan takes stock of an eventful <num>2008</num> 
tashkent - <num>2008</num>  was an eventful year for uzbekistan . 
the death penalty was abolished ,  the european union partially lifted its sanctions against the country imposed after the may <num>2005</num>  andijan uprising ,  progress was made towards the eradication of child labour in cotton fields and uzbekistan exited the eurasian economic community  ( eaec )  . 
in september ,  prime minister shavkat mirziyayev signed a resolution to implement conventions ratified by uzbekistan on the minimum age for employment and the prohibition of child labour . 
he had previously warned subordinates that the use of child labour in agriculture would be severely punished . 
in october ,  the ec partially lifted its sanctions against uzbekistan imposed in <num>2005</num>  following the events in andijan when an anti-government demonstration was brutally crushed . 
the ec did not lift its restrictions on the sale of weapons ,  ammunition and other equipment to uzbekistan ,  but did ease visa restrictions on eight uzbek officials . 
uzbekistan has started an aids relief programme
in addition to the clinic ,  the national plan provides for the manufacture by domestic companies of medical equipment ,  devices and medication for aids treatment . 
official <num>2008</num>  aids statistics have not yet been announced ,  but experts believe that the number of those infected with hiv will be higher than it was in <num>2007</num>  .
aktobe manager vladimir mukhanov made three changes to his starting line-up for the final . 
a further change was made in midfield ,  with marat hairullin replaced by aleksandr mitrofanov . 
two minutes before the end of the second period ,  mukhanov was sent on as a substitute for sidelnikov due to his ability to save penalties .

tajikistan prepares for annual locust infestation
a locust invasion is recorded annually in regions along the afghanistan-uzbekistan border . 
 ( photo by samuel aranda / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - the tajikistan ministry of agriculture is developing two programmes to combat agriculture pests and protect plants . 
this year ,  approximately us$1 . 5 million is being allocated from the state budget for the preparation of special machines ,  chemical pesticides and the localisation of the centres of infestation of agricultural lands by the larvae of locusts and other pests . 
to combat agricultural pests during the planting season it is necessary to establish cooperation with neighbouring countries ,  experts say ,  because measures to localise centres of the appearance of the pests must be taken simultaneously in all potentially dangerous border regions . 
joint measures also make it possible to significantly reduce material and technical expenditures in doing that . 
with financial support from the fao ,  tajikistans ministry of agriculture has acquired a sufficient amount of special machines ,  chemical pesticides and two new airplanes to be used in this years efforts to combat the locust menace .

a step forward for freedom of the press in kazakhstan
the kazakh president signed amendments to the law on mass media . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
miklos harasti ,  the osce representative responsible for freedom of the media ,  welcomed the amendments ,  but stressed that the liberalisation of kazakhstans media laws must continue ,  since they do not yet meet international standards . 
harasti offered the kazakh government his agencys aid in conducting further reforms in this area . 
the kazakh president ,  on the same day ,  also signed amendments to the law on political parties making the process of registering new parties easier . 
national bank of kazakhstan devalues the tenge
at some bureaux de change the exchange rate jumped from <num>121</num>  to <num>200</num>  tenge to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar . 
 ( photo by mustafa ozer / afp / getty images ) 
marchenko ,  who only recently took over from anwar saidenov ,  a staunch opponent of devaluation ,  said the decision was dictated by the need to maintain our current level of gold and foreign-currency reserves and keep exports competitive . 
other reasons for the exchange rate adjustment include the fall in oil prices and currency devaluations by some of kazakhstans trading partners ,  in particular russia . 
despite the national banks assertion that the potential for any expectations of further falls in value will be eliminated once the announced guideline of <num>150</num>  tenge is reached ,  the guideline was based on the assumption that a shortage of tenge will not give rise to steady demand for foreign currencies . 
the bank has also threatened to clamp down hard on any attempts at speculation on the currency markets . 
at the time of writing the exchange rate at some bureaux de change had jumped from <num>121</num>  to <num>200</num>  tenge to the dollar . 
the market rate was between <num>139</num>  and <num>149</num>  tenge to the dollar . 
he said the decision was implemented within <num>12</num>  hours of being taken ,  preventing any leaks of information . 
the news came as a shock to the public and drew highly critical reactions from the media . 
without wishing to cast doubt on the economic prudence of the decision ,  it is clear that this should have been done more gradually ,  taking not only economic interests but also public expectations into account ,  wrote the kazakh newspaper delovaya nedelya . 
this makes things a lot harder for banks and businesses that have to pay off foreign debts . 
one dollar will cost them around <num>20</num>  tenge more than it did ,  and if this is multiplied by several billion ,  it means their outgoings will run into the hundreds of billions of tenge ,  wrote delovaya nedelya .

tajikistan- on january <num>30</num>  , the tajikistan flag was raised in antarctica by professor abdulhamid kayumov ,  who became the first tajik to travel there . 
he arrived as part of an international expedition and delivered the flag to the russian mirny station there . 
kazakhstan - kazakhstans foreign ministry has officially said the country has allowed the transit of civilian cargo through its territory to support the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  military contingent in afghanistan . 
stabilising the situation in afghanistan was mentioned as a priority in cooperation between kazakhstan and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  during a recent telephone conversation between presidents nazarbayev and obama . 
kazakhstans decision ,  which comes as the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  military base in kyrgyzstan is closing ,  raised questions among russian journalists who attended the briefing as to astanas plans to join nato . 
kazakhstan is indeed building a partnership with the alliance ,  but has no plans now or in the foreseeable future to join nato ,  ashikbayev said . 
he met <abbr>feb.</abbr> 
<num>6</num>  with secretary of state hillary clinton . 
sautbayev said the new <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  administration plans not only to expand its strategic partnership with kazakhstan ,  but also give strong impetus to interstate relations as a whole . 
we firmed up the understanding of the importance of our country in washington not only in terms of bilateral relations but also in terms of international affairs . 
<num>12</num>  , <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  engineers began construction of an automobile engine factory that will manufacture <num>360,000</num>  engines a year . 
the factory belongs to the joint uzbek-u . s .  enterprise gm powertrain uzbekistan and is being built in a tashkent industrial zone with a six-lane highway connecting the construction site to the main railway terminals . 
militant threats chill pakistani entertainers
as taliban militants gain a stronger hold in this region of pakistan ,  they are imposing their view that music ,  singing and other such arts are un-islamic . 
criminal gangs seeking to extort money are also suspected of involvement as overall security deteriorates . 
the campaign has further weakened a once-thriving cultural scene ,  despite hopes for a comeback after a secular party defeated an islamist coalition in elections last year . 
the austerity also runs contrary to a rich tradition of music ,  dance ,  singing and poetry among the pashtuns ,  the ethnic group that is dominant both in the area and amongst the taliban . 
 " if we get killed ,  no one cares "  ,  he said .

tajikistan - in <num>2008</num>  , the consumers union of tajikistan  ( spt )  helped to return <num>4,700</num>  somoni  ( us$1 , 270 )  to its clients as compensation for damages caused by poor quality goods and services . 
since the organisations creation in <num>2003</num>  , approximately <num>75,000</num>  somoni  ( more than us$20 , 000 )  has been returned to consumers in legal process . 
earlier ,  similar cases were hardly ever examined . 
in the opinion of specialists ,  an effective system of consumer protection in tajikistan must consist of a complex structure of state ,  public and judicial protections ,  including effective legislation .

about <num>70</num>  percent of the countrys population lives in extreme poverty in rural areas ,  though hunger exists in the cities as well . 
tajikistans electrical system is suffering from near complete collapse for the second winter in a row ,  according to icg experts . 
tajikistan has to buy gas and electricity abroad ,  though weeks ago neighbouring uzbekistan cut its gas supplies to tajikistan in half because of dushanbes growing debt . 
the authors of the report call on western countries to review their aid programmes for tajikistan ,  and recommends the tajik government develop a plan to create new jobs and prevent starvation . 
not everyone in tajikistan agrees with their assessment . 
according to economist firuz saidov the factors the icg report mentions dont justify a prediction of bankruptcy . 
as he put it ,  tajikistan always listened to the recommendations of international organisations ,  and if the country is headed down the wrong path ,  then it means the recommendations werent all that useful . 
regarding the energy crisis ,  saidov said that tajikistan has a solution in the rogun hydroelectric station ,  which has not been fully constructed . 
the economist shares the icg's opinion that corruption is growing in tajikistan ,  but noted that the phenomenon also prevails in many other countries . 
tajik armed forces celebrate 16t anniversary
after the civil war ended with the loss of between <num>100,000</num>  and <num>150,000</num>  lives ,  the army lacked manpower ,  a officer corps ,  materiel and equipment ,  which severely limited its war-readiness . 
today ,  tajikistan's armed forces are fairly battle-worthy and include land-based and mobile units ,  an air force and an anti-aircraft force . 
estimates of the military's size and equipment vary widely depending on the source . 
according to experts ,  the tajik army numbers about <num>20,000</num>  personnel . 
three tajik battalions are part of the collective rapid-response forces of the collective security treaty organisation . 
military service in tajikistan is mandatory at present . 
each year the military calls up to duty as many as <num>9,000</num>  people for <num>24</num>  months . 
that term was reduced to <num>12</num>  months this year and mandatory military service will be cancelled in the not too far distant future .

there was a subsequent cooling in relations between turkey and uzbekistan ,  however ,  because turkey refused to extradite erk opposition party leader mukhammad salikh . 
uzbekistan had convicted him in absentia for connections with extremists and considered him a suspect in a plot to assassination president islam karimov . 
consequently nursis pamphlets were banned and uzbek-turkish vocational schools were closed in uzbekistan .

deputy transport and communications minister bek zuhurov said at the meeting that the csc is necessary to tighten up national security and make the activity of operators more transparent . 
the ministry contends that the money passing unseen through telecommunications networks is costing the government millions of dollars every day . 
it is also argues that the csc will greatly assist law enforcement agencies by providing swift access to information of interest to them and precluding the need to contact private mobile operators . 
tajiktelecom ,  the existing state-owned telecoms operator ,  which operates on the market with private companies ,  has been proposed as the base for the csc . 
kazakh ngos demand return of remains of last kazakh khan
the request said ,  we need to restore the primacy ,  historical roots and spirit of our steppe nation . 
at the end of february a group of kazakh ngos made their latest request for the presidents help in bringing back and burying the remains of kenesary kasymov ,  the last kazakh khan who was a significant 19t century historical figure . 
his body is presumed to be buried in kyrgyzstan ,  and his head is somewhere in the archives of a russian museum . 
kazakhstan's official inquiries about the return of kenesary's head have yielded no results . 
the situation with his body is even more complicated . 
the khan's executioners left nothing to mark his burial place . 
tajikistan declares march <num>8</num>  mothers day
tajikistan - on march <num>7</num>  , tajik president emomali rakhmon renamed international womens day ,  which is celebrated on march <num>8</num>  and became widely popular during the soviet era ,  as mothers day . 
the presidents announcement declared that tajik mothers must now celebrate march <num>8</num>  not as they did before ,  but in the spirit of our culture and the traditions of our people . 
rakhmon said that a holiday celebrating mothers existed in what is now tajikistan <num>3,000</num>  years ago . 
around the end of february or early march the arian men gave their wives and mothers tokens of their appreciation . 
this is more acceptable for our culture ,  he said . 
the president cited scholar aburaikhona beruni ,  saying that the holiday was called muzhdagiron in persian . 
today our independent nation must resume that forgotten national holiday ,  mothers day ,  and show that our people have always had respect for mothers ,  the president said . 
the tajik president has made several similar changes over the past three years . 
he has banned proms at schools and universities ,  the abc day at schools ,  and limited the time and days when weddings and funerals can be held . 
analysts identify tajikistans efforts to move away from its soviet past and return to its islamic roots as a key factor in the worsening situation for tajik women . 
domestic violence is considered a normal part of private life and is not recognised as a problem that warrants interference by society . 
research by the regional office of the un womens development fund revealed that more than <num>70</num>  percent of women are subjected to some form of violence in tajikistan every year . 
international adoption in kyrgyzstan officially began in <num>2005</num>  .
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - kyrgyzstans parliament is demanding stricter rules for the adoption of children by foreign citizens . 
parliamentarians believe that international adoption should be a last resort and should involve only children with physical disabilities that are expensive to treat . 
the government introduced some restrictions in february . 
according to the new rules ,  the adoption of children by foreigners is possible only when the kyrgyz government has an agreement with the government of the adoptive parents' country . 
according to the un children's fund ,  there are <num>11</num>  active organisations in kyrgyzstan that handle international adoptions . 
since <num>2006</num>  more than <num>200</num>  children have been adopted by foreign parents .

according to kuleshov ,  the activists were held in the bishkek psychiatric ward after their arrest . 
the doctors drew blood from me three times and gave me shots after which i lost consciousness ,  kuleshov said upon his release the following day . 
golovanov was released after two days thanks to intervention by the kyrgyz ombudsmans office . 
the new political movement <num>25</num>  is named for the article of the kyrgyz constitution that guarantees the right of public assembly . 
the movement unites young human rights activists ,  some of whom are veterans of the kel-kel youth movement ,  which played a crucial role in the tulip revolution . 
according to movement coordinator mikhail golovanov ,  <num>25</num>  was started by people concerned about the defence of human rights who wanted to express their opinions using constitutional means . 
the government is appointed to defend peoples rights ,  and if any form of rule becomes destructive ,  citizens have the right to express their disagreement with the current policies and to demand change ,  golovanov said . 
the <num>25</num>  movement is distinguished by its noisy and original protests ,  which leave everyone talking the next day . 
kyrgyzstan's political life recently has grown noticeably more active . 
most political analysts link that to presidential elections that may be set for the autumn . 
zeromax scandal raises questions about ownership
tashkent - zeromax ,  a swiss-based conglomerate ,  continues to operate in uzbekistan in the face of a half-billion-dollar debt to the government and a court order to seize its assets . 
but the companys future remains as mysterious and disputed as its ownership . 
zeromax created controversy when critics alleged it was enriching gulnara karimova ,  president islam karimovs daughter . 
it listed its <num>2008</num>  operating income as <num>3.298</num>  billion swiss francs  ( us <num>2.848</num>  $  billion )  . 
now ,  it has been plunged into scandal and court proceedings . 
the firms troubles began may <num>5</num>  when an uzbek court ordered its assets seized and a halt to its operations to satisfy nearly a half-billion-dollar debt to the uzbek government . 
uzbek political scientist tashbulat yuldashev identified the debt as unpaid taxes on oil and gas export revenues that the company was supposed to pay starting in <num>2006</num>  after a five-year tax holiday . 
unconfirmed reports may <num>21</num>  said that uzbekneftegaz and russias lukoil bought <num>51</num>  %  and <num>49</num>  %  ,  respectively ,  of the firm . 
but an anonymous uzbek journalist disputed claims of lukoils participation . 
in uzbekistan ,  the company shows signs of disarray . 
police questioned zeromax executive director mirodil jalalov in may ,  holding him for some time ,  economist and former uzbek diplomat alisher taksanov told central asia online . 
a source with numerous zeromax contacts in karshy ,  where zeromax has a number of projects ,  said jalalov was questioned before being released . 
he might as well return to the company ,  the observer added . 
most of the companys employees are on unpaid furlough ,  but will return in late july ,  the karshy source said . 
most of the employees and some of the management will be back ,  the source added . 
even uzbek football might have been affected . 
star brazilian coach luis felipe scolari resigned early from the zeromax-backed football team ,  fc bunyodkor of tashkent ,  citing team financial problems . 
were all in shock because the club is completely broke ,  a bunyodkor employee recently told central asia online . 
the uzbek prosecutors office has refused to comment on the zeromax case . 
karimova has denied reports that she fully or partly owned zeromax . 
karimova never owned the company ,  a zeromax employee in switzerland told central asia online ,  saying jalalov owned the firm . 
the swiss commercial register has never listed karimova as a company partner or officer . 
the swiss register previously listed zeromax holdings ag and american businessman harry eustace as part-owners . 
official data wont tell you anything ,  an anonymous zeromax employee said . 
… she has a share of it ,  as she does of many things . 
zeromax even borrowed from foreign investors  ( the world bank and asian development bank  [ adb ]  )  under government guarantees ,  taksanov said . 
the world bank and adb both told central asia online they had no financial involvement with zeromax . 
some observers have wondered whether zeromaxs problems mean that karimova is losing her chance to succeed her father ,  with some predicting the ascendancy of prime minister shavkat mirziyaev . 
another school of thought holds that the companys troubles do not affect karimova ,  the uzbek ambassador to spain . 
karimova might not object to zeromaxs disappearance or even want to be president of uzbekistan ,  observers suggested to central asia online . 
he knows she doesnt have the administrative experience  ( to be president )  . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  she has everything she wants ,  taksanov said . 
agreeing with taksanov is a former assistant of karimovas who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
zeromax accomplished its mission . 
it laundered the money ,  shipped it to offshore accounts . 
gulnara didnt need this ;  she needs to look clean for european society . 
… zeromax was attracting jealousy . 
so it gets jettisoned like a snake shedding an old skin .

moldoshev ,  however ,  has requested that control over border crossing points be given to the national security service .

<num>13</num>  in a car crash in kyrgyzstan ,  which also killed sergey slepchenko ,  the former chief of the disbanded international institute for strategic studies ,  and sadyrkulovs chauffeur kubat sulajmanov . 
a representative of the ministry of internal affairs said that ,  for unknown reasons ,  an audi <num>100</num>  smashed into the lexus carrying sadyrkulov and the men accompanying him as it was parked on the side of the road . 
both vehicles burst into flames immediately . 
upon arriving on the scene ,  police officers found three bodies . 
the driver of the audi was unhurt and has been placed under arrest . 
authorities have so far declined to comment on the incident citing the ongoing investigation . 
dna tests will have to be carried out to identify the dead men officially ,  and are expected to take approximately one month . 
according to early reports ,  sadyrkulovs body was identified by his dentist . 
the president of kyrgyzstan has ordered the procurator-general and the minister of internal affairs to set up an interdepartmental committee to carry out a full investigation into the incident .

 ( photo by reuters / maria golovnina ,  tajikistan ) 
dushanbe-on march <num>17</num>  , tajikistan unveiled its sughd and pyanj economic free zones  ( efzs )  . 
the <num>320</num>  hectare sughd efz is located in the industrial district of khudzhanda ,  the capital of the sughd region . 
the zones will remain in operation for <num>25</num>  years . 
kislyakova believes the efzs will spur manufacturing and service industries ,  create new jobs and increase the country's export potential . 
in setting up the zones ,  officials looked at successful models in china ,  iran and egypt ,  along with unsuccessful examples in cis countries where efzs were closed because they proved ineffective . 
to work in tajikistan's efzs ,  companies must invest more than us$500 , 000 and begin actual production no later than three years after they register with the government to do so .

astana - the new generation evolution diesel locomotive built by general electric was presented in almaty on march <num>18</num>  when it made its maiden journey from almaty-1 station along the almaty-ush-tobe line ,  one of the most difficult railroad stretches in the country . 
the opening of the plant is part of a plan by the kazakh government to reform and update the national rail industry . 
according to the transport and communications ministry ,  kazakhstans rolling stock is more than <num>60</num>  percent depreciated and drastic measures must be taken soon to maintain the rail systems operability in the future . 
parliament sets date for kyrgyz presidential elections
feliks kulov ,  a former prime minister of kyrgyzstan and now leader of an opposition party ,  said his partys political committee would decide on his bid to stand for president within a week . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
on march <num>20</num>  , the kyrgyz parliament voted on a date for presidential elections during a special session of the committee for constitutional legislation ,  the structure of the state ,  lawfulness and human rights . 
the vote set july <num>23</num>  as election day . 
all mps voted in favour of the proposed date ,  though a few had reservations . 
the date for presidential elections is not stipulated in the countrys recently adopted revised constitution . 
to resolve the issue ,  social democratic party mp asylbek zheenbekov filed a request with the constitutional court ,  which ruled that the elections must take place by october <num>25</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
on the basis of that decision ,  the parliament committee for constitutional legislation then had to calculate the most acceptable date ,  taking into account of the possibility that a second round might have to be held ,  the length of time that the central election committee would need to determine the results ,  and other such factors . 
the date arrived at was thursday ,  july <num>23</num>  , which broke the tradition of holding elections on a weekend day . 
the ak zhol party has already announced that it will officially put forward its leader ,  president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  as its candidate in the next few days . 
the head of state announced his intention to run on february <num>11</num>  , before the election dates was set even though his five year term would not have ended until next year . 
bakiyevs rivals are likely to include his former colleague and now political opponent feliks kulov ,  the leader of the ar namys party . 
kulov said on march <num>20</num>  that his partys political committee would decide on his bid within a week . 
water doesnt always make it to the fields at the end of the canal . 
 ( photo by reuters / david gray ) 
the ministry of agriculture is offering farmers a series of measures to reduce the ill effects of a lack of water . 
farmers are being advised to avoid cotton plants and to sow part of their fields with crops that require less moisture . 
the projected cost of the project is us$60 million . 
construction should begin and end in <num>2009</num>  .
bringing water from shardara to the fields of the maktaaral district will solve <num>80</num>  percent of cotton growers watering needs from the dostyk canal ,  shukeev said . 
the situation of kazakh cotton growers demonstrates the degree to which the agriculture of every central asian country depends on the understanding and cooperation of all the others . 
the conclusion of bilateral agreements with uzbekistan on the use of water resources from the naryn-syrdarin reservoir did not lead to the expected results . 
specialists believe the answer is a four-way agreement that would settle the rights and obligations of kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  uzbekistan and tajikistan . 
such an agreement was concluded ten years ago . 
at that time ,  central asian countries were able to agree on the principles of compensatory interstate supplies of fuel and electricity . 
to what degree that is possible today ,  during the global financial crisis ,  remains an open question . 
celebration of navruz on march <num>21</num>  in the city of tursunzade ,  tajikistan . 
 ( photo by reuters / nozim kalandarov ) 
dushanbe-parliament voted recently to celebrate navruz  ( new day )  from march <num>21</num>  to <num>24</num>  every year in order to revive and preserve national traditions . 
on march <num>21</num>  , festive navruz events were also held in russian cities where a large segment of tajikistans population is temporarily employed . 
mukim maibaliyev ,  tajik community chairman in russia ,  said that the main goal of celebrating navruz in russia is to draw together the two peoples who ,  until the fall of the ussr ,  lived in the same country . 
living and working in russia ,  the tajik people are trying to not only become better acquainted with the history ,  culture and customs of its residents but to acquaint them with the traditions and culture of the tajik people . 
kazakhstan promotes export of kumys ,  the national drink
kumys for sale at a roadside stand . 
in addition ,  kazbekova noted that it is not easy to enter foreign markets without meeting international product safety and packaging standards . 
before kumys can be exported ,  kazakhstan will have to resolve a number of technical issues such as transport ,  packaging and developing a process to preserve all the curative properties of kumys over a period of months . 
according to the rrg ,  in practice ,  the new rules restrict the access of individuals and legal entities to foreign currency on the territory of uzbekistan . 
 ( photo by leon neal / afp / getty images ) 
according to rrg experts ,  in practise ,  the new rules restrict the access of individuals and legal entities to foreign currency on the territory of uzbekistan ,  and are meant to impose even greater government control over the countrys foreign exchange market . 
according to the order on the introduction of changes to transactions on the foreign exchange market of the republic of uzbekistan ,  which came into force in mid-february ,  a bank client must open a special account to hold foreign currency . 
if the foreign currency purchased isn't used within seven working days from the moment the money was credited to the account ,  the bank may purchase it and sell it to another buyer in the future . 
this local reaction to the global financial crisis ,  according to rrg ,  is leading to greater government control over the foreign exchange market . 
it has taken years to achieve but finally the busy road running through herats group of mediaeval minarets has been closed to traffic . 
the fragile towers are a part of what remains of a once-wondrous 15t century madrassa-mosque complex built by queen gawharshad ,  daughter-in-law of mighty emperor timur . 
a century ago ,  there were <num>12</num>  of these minarets ,  covered in colourful tiles that shone out across the desert . 
now only five remain - one is badly damaged and is currently being stabilised . 
the heavy flow of traffic on the commercially important road linking western afghanistan with iran ,  sends constant tremors through the monuments . 
a major concern is that the monuments will no longer be able to stand the vibrations and crumble to the ground . 
this is a temporary measure and discussions are underway on how to stabilise the monument more permanently or even reverse the tilt . 
herat has registered the old town for inclusion on unescos list of world heritage sites . 
the benefits this would bestow are considerable ,  increasing the flow of conservation funding and planting the city firmly on the tourist map . 
in addition to the minarets in herat ,  other sites of historical importance include the masjid-e jami mosque and the residential quarters of the old city . 
according to unescos web site ,  the old city is a complex network of alleys  [ leading ]  to fine houses built around open courtyards ,  or small gardens ,  or to the many mosques ,  synagogues ,  schools ,  public baths or reservoirs that dot the urban fabric . 
while such fabric is characteristic of large urban centres in the region ,  it has been lost in most other cases . 
conservationists have been battling for years to have the road that runs through the group of minarets closed . 
it closed briefly in <num>2007</num>  but soon reopened - reportedly because of residents complaints . 
brendan cassar ,  unescos consultant for culture in kabul ,  recently returned from a meeting in rome to discuss the decision of the afghan government to apply for world heritage status for herat . 
we have been informed by the governor  [ of herat ]  that the road is closed ,  cassar said . 
we welcome that as a step in the right direction towards conserving herats cultural heritage . 
he said that preserving the monument will bring development and wealth to the area . 
he explained :  this is not a debate of the residents versus the monument . 
in a stable afghanistan ,  this historical site will become part of an important long-term strategy of tourism attracting sightseers from within afghanistan ,  the region and other parts of the world . 
weis and hugo plays banned in dushanbe
the revolutionary mood in 18t century france triggers unhealthy associations in the minds of tajik culture officials . 
dushanbe - on march <num>20</num>  , the tajik ministry of culture banned the play madness :  year <num>93</num>  , directed by barzu abdurazokov of the russian mayakovsky theatre ,  after its first performance march <num>17</num>  .
the play is based on works by german playwright peter ulrich weis who wrote the persecution and murder of jean paul marat ,  and victor hugo who wrote ninety-three . 
both works deal with the revolutionary events in 18t century france . 
the director said the premier was attended by tajikistans cultural elite as well as the heads of diplomatic missions who were enthusiastic about the play . 
officials from tajikistans ministry of culture ,  who later ordered the play banned ,  also attended the premier . 
they justified the ban by saying the play had a revolutionary mood ,  abdurazokov said . 
oddly enough ,  the ministry of culture had approved the script before rehearsals began .

abdurakhmanov was arrested last june when police searching his car discovered <num>114</num>  grams of marijuana and six grams of opium . 
the prosecution held that the journalist kept the narcotics for both personal use and for sale . 
psychological and medical analyses concluded ,  however ,  that the accused was not an addict and the drug use charges were dropped . 
the police widened their search ,  however ,  to include the journalist's flat where they seized his computer and documents . 
abdurakhmanov's defence has appealed the conviction a number of times . 
the last appeal was made through the commission for oversight of the supreme court of karakalpakstan at the behest of the supreme court of uzbekistan ,  but the conviction of the lower court was upheld . 
in <num>2008</num>  , amnesty international recognised abdurakhmanov as a prisoner of conscience ,  and the osce ,  the committee to protect journalists and reporters without borders are now seeking the overturn of his conviction . 
training a regiment of legally versed journalists
a state programme was adopted in <num>2006</num>  to train mass media staff . 
 ( photo by christopher furlong / getty images ) 
many editorial offices are unable to retain journalists with specialised educations due in part to their small budgets and economic instability overall . 
the shortage of qualified reporters affects the quality of information and the accuracy of reporting ,  the editor-in-chief at one capital newspaper said . 
against that background ,  in <num>2006</num>  the ministry started a programme to train mass media staff . 
the programme recently added a two-year course at the national university of uzbekistan for persons who already hold a bachelors degree in another area . 
the idea behind the initiative was that a basic education in journalism would help address the shortage of journalists that exists in outlying regions and increase the number of reporters who are able to write analytical articles . 
to date <num>200</num>  people have completed the journalism classes and another <num>100</num>  will graduate in june . 
pakistani investigators make significant arrests
police ,  military and security officials holding weapons detain a suspected militant from the site of a shooting at a police training centre in lahore ,  march <num>30</num>  .
theres been significant progress ,  said a senior police investigator on april <num>1</num>  .
we have captured seven men who had direct links with the attackers . 
two of them were handlers . 
pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud claimed on march <num>31</num>  that his group had carried out the assault on the training centre in retaliation for nato attacks on militants in pakistan . 
mehsuds organisation has links to al-qaeda and other islamist militant groups
the government security official ,  however ,  declined to give details and said the claim by the notorious mehsud could have been a ruse aimed at misleading investigators . 
the senior police investigator said the attackers had prepared for the attack carefully ,  visiting the training centre several times to work out the best ways to gain entrance . 
there are many things to be investigated ,  many holes to be filled in . 
the government security official said despite mehsuds claim of responsibility ,  other groups could have been involved . 
it's a complicated puzzle and we will need time to get to the bottom of it "  ,  he concluded . 
kazakhstan steps up fight against drug trade
tajik customs agents inspect freight bound from afghanistan . 
tajikistans border with afghanistan is the longest among all central asian countries ,  and is ground zero for stopping drug shipments bound for russia and western europe . 
astana-on march <num>31</num>  , kazakhstans cabinet considered plans to step up the fight against drug abuse and the drug trade . 
kazakhstan has been drawn into a global drug smuggling network "  ,  according to a report by prime minister karim masimov . 
 " the main source of narcotics is afghanistan ;  between five and <num>15</num>  percent of that country's exported drugs transit is through kazakhstan .  " 
according to kazakh law enforcement statistics ,  police smashed nine drug rings last year and brought more than <num>1,600</num>  criminal cases against drug dealers . 
also ,  border agents thwarted <num>23</num>  illegal drug shipments and seized <num>28</num>  tonnes of narcotics  ( <num>20</num>  percent more than in <num>2007</num>  )  . 
this year has already seen two more drug rings uncovered by law enforcement . 
to deal with the drug supply problem ,  the kazakh government has proposed stepping up border security ,  carrying out commando-style raids ,  planting informants and infiltrating narcotics rings . 
it will also create new drug enforcement bodies in the zhambyl region and the cities of shymkent and karaganda . 
to combat growing demand ,  kazakhstan's government intends to strengthen drug prevention programmes in schools ,  increase oversight of entertainment venues and mandate club and bar curfews for teens . 
additionally ,  a bill has been introduced to mandate drug testing of all students . 
a pilot programme that tested <num>7,000</num>  school-age and university students in astana showed that <num>2.5</num>  percent used drugs . 
the ministry of health has already invited the german surgeon to return to tajikistan in november <num>2009</num>  , where he will spend two weeks performing dozens of plastic and reconstructive procedures . 
biemer has made annual visits to tajikistan to do pro-bono work for each of the last eight years . 
over this period ,  he has seen around <num>1,000</num>  patients and performed more than <num>200</num>  complex reconstructive and / or plastic surgery operations . 
the ministry of health says that thanks to close cooperation with the rechts der isar clinic at munich technical university ,  where biemer works ,  reconstructive surgery in tajikistan has advanced and the capacity of the national centre for reconstructive surgery has greatly increased since <num>2000</num>  .

cotton harvest in tajikistan becomes problematic
according to experts calculations ,  cotton yields must exceed <num>1.362</num>  tonnes or <num>30</num>  centners per hectare to make the crop profitable in tajikistan . 
 ( photo by china photos / getty images ) 
dushanbe-the global financial crisis has cast doubt on projections for cotton production in tajikistan for this year . 
many farms cannot get loans to grow cotton because they have not yet paid off last years debt to commercial banks . 
according to sayidmurod bakhridinov ,  head of the crop production department of the ministry of agriculture ,  many farmers have still not been able to sell last years crop due to a sharp decrease in the price for ginned cotton on the world market ,  which will not cover the cost of its production . 
for that reason ,  cotton growers cannot pay off loans they took out last year and ,  therefore ,  are unable to borrow funds this season . 
state statistics committee data indicated that the export of ginned cotton in january and february this year reached almost <num>14,000</num>  tons valued at almost us$15 million . 
at the same time ,  farmers outstanding debt to banks on last years loans is approximately <num>30</num>  $  million . 
the tajik ministry of agriculture estimates that production of raw cotton this year will total approximately <num>580,000</num>  tons due to an expected increase in crop yields . 
last years harevest was <num>380,000</num>  tons . 
this year ,  however ,  land sown to cotton decreased by <num>50,000</num>  hectares to <num>200,000</num>  hectares . 
that makes the ministrys harvest estimates for this year unconvincing . 
according to experts' calculations ,  to make tajikistan's cotton industry profitable ,  it will be necessary to bring cotton yields up to <num>1.362</num>  tonnes ,  or <num>30</num>  centners per hectare . 
to achieve such a yield ,  approximately half a billion <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollars will have to be invested in cotton . 
under conditions of financial crisis and the drop in demand for ginned cotton ,  foreign investment will come nowhere near that amount and the tajikistan ministry of finance plans to provide only us$50 million in credits this year for development of the agricultural sector as a whole ,  with only a part of it for cotton . 
by the end of last month ,  only a bit more than us$1 million of the promised credit had been allocated . 
tajik officials transition from four wheels to two

kyrgyzstan conducts exercises on liberating petroleum installations from terrorists
according to the training scenario ,  the special forces troops had to rescue simulated hostages in a school building . 
kyrgyzstan - from march <num>30</num>  through april <num>2</num>  , large scale exercises by ministry of internal affairs and state committee of national security  ( scns )  special forces were conducted on liberating petroleum installations from terrorists . 
according to the training scenario ,  the special forces troops had to rescue simulated hostages in a school building . 
after that ,  they had to battle intruders who had seized a petroleum installation . 
preparations for such situations is a high priority for kyrgyzstan for several reasons . 
first of all ,  the country is experiencing an acute shortage of energy resources ,  and petroleum depots are strategically important installations . 
secondly ,  the country still vividly recalls when in <num>1999</num>  and <num>2000</num>  armed terrorist militants from the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  penetrated kyrgyzstan territory to claim a section of the fergana valley as part of uzbekistan and took hostages . 
the third reason is tied to the rich history of prison upheavals in the republic . 
criminal wars between competing mafia groups often shift to the territories of prison colonies . 
from april <num>24</num>  through <num>25</num>  , joint command staff and mobilization exercises  " security - <num>2009</num>  "  ,  are planned under the leadership of defence minister major general bakytbek kalyyev . 
according to the military agency ,  troops will drill in  " preparation and execution of tasks providing military security in the southern region of kyrgyzstan . 
 "  tactical forces of the ministries of defence and internal affairs ,  the ministry of emergency situations ,  the state committee for national security ,  the border service ,  the republic national guard and a number of other ministries and agencies will take part in the joint manoeuvres .

just less than half that amount will be invested in the construction of <num>12</num>  greenhouses with a total area of <num>2,800</num>  square metres in the tavildarin ,  tajikabad and jilikul regions . 
their construction will provide the population and markets with food products ,  and create additional jobs and conditions to make the areas more competitive agriculturally . 
according to tajikistan deputy minister of agriculture shukrullo rakhimnazarov ,  the successful completion of these projects will allow farmers not only to market fresh farm products all year round to the republic's cities ,  but also increase exports to neighbouring countries . 
tajikistan annually exports up to <num>100,000</num>  tons of vegetables and fruits ,  which in <num>2008</num>  earned more than <num>50</num>  $  million dollars in revenue . 
timely detection of tajik budget lapse prevents ecology service break-up
he said that ,  all fines and mandatory payments as a result of breaches of ecological standards are paid into the state budget ,  but not a single cent had been allocated to finance ecological programmes or pay salaries of members of the police force . 
according to him ,  about us$3 million is needed annually to implement them all . 
in light of this ,  zikirov subsequently proposed the introduction of amendments and additions to the law on other mandatory payments into the budget ,  according to which a portion of the payments recovered from polluters will be paid into a special ministry of finance account for the nine mandated environmental protection sector programmes . 
despite the amendments ,  the ecological situation in tajikistan remains problematic . 
saulyus smalis ,  the osce environmental protection advisor in dushanbe ,  noted that the most serious ecological threat in the country is posed by the sogdi regions storage facility for radioactive waste products . 
he noted that experts estimate that the volume of radioactive waste in the region is about <num>55</num>  million tonnes ,  which he described as a time bomb . 
he also said that available medical statistics suggest that the incidence of cancer in the region is <num>250</num> -<num>300</num>  percent higher than elsewhere in the country .

protection of childrens rights in tajikistan needs reform
about us$0 . 20 a day per child is budgeted for orphanages operated by tajikistans education ministry . 
tajikistan - the results of an analysis of the effectiveness of the policy for protecting childrens rights in tajikistan ,  which was conducted by the tajik government with help from unicef ,  were recently announced in dushanbe . 
the study was conducted to devise effective approaches to protecting children and to make financial recommendations . 
its authors contend that the countrys budget policy must be revised . 
the success of making a transition from a traditional system based on government orphanages to a modern system based on orphans supported by foster families is dependant on amendments to the national budget and government policy . 
about <num>9,500</num>  children are currently living in orphanages in tajikistan ,  but just <num>16</num>  percent of them do not have living parents or other close relatives . 
dilorom mirsaidova ,  deputy chairman of the government childrens rights committee and one of the authors of the study ,  said that in eight regions of the country more than <num>3,000</num>  children were transferred from boarding schools to homes in <num>2008</num>  .
tajikistan does not have a special agency responsible for drawing up policy and providing services to children in need of protection . 
orphanages and boarding schools are controlled by different ministries ,  so financing for them is not uniform . 
the boarding schools controlled by the labour and social welfare ministry receive up to about us$2 . 00 per child per day ,  while orphanages controlled by the education ministry receive one tenth that amount . 
nadzhiba shirinbekova ,  director of the nongovernmental organisation law and welfare ,  said the study of the effectiveness of the childrens rights policy in tajikistan showed that it is time to switch to financing by objective . 
we are spending huge sums to keep children who have parents and guardians in boarding schools ,  while this money could be provided to the families of these children to support them at home ,  she said .

after bishkek ratified the optional protocol to the un convention on torture and other cruel or demeaning treatment and punishment in <num>2008</num>  , a working group led by the kyrgyz ombudsman undertook efforts to set up a special body that would address these problems in kyrgyzstan . 
ombudsman tursunbek akun said he will soon submit a bill to parliament on civilian control over institutions limiting or depriving freedom . 
she added that she believes ,  the state is ready to eradicate torture and it is not a matter of money ;  most important is changing the way people think about the practice . 
head of the voice of freedom fund sardar bagishbekov ,  however ,  said human rights activists are aware of <num>87</num>  incidents of torture from march <num>2007</num>  to the end of last year . 
in addition ,  four fatalities related to torture were reported in kyrgyzstan in <num>2007</num>  .
we have hard evidence about these incidents . 
but so far nobody has been able to prove torture and no security official has been held accountable ,  he said . 
uzbekistan remains afghanistan's main electricity supplier
power lines over uzbek fields
construction of a <num>442</num> -kilometre  ( <num>275</num> -mile )  high voltage transmission line in afghanistan is to be completed by october <num>2008</num>  .
it will run from kabul through five afghan provinces towards the countrys border with uzbekistan ,  and will connect to the uzbek electricity transmission system . 
it is expected the project will cost <num>198</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  ,  and will have a capacity of <num>220</num>  kw . 
during a visit to uzbekistan headed by the afghan minister of energy and water ,  mohammad ismael khan ,  and the minister of the economy ,  jalil shams ,  talks were held with batyr teshabaev ,  chairman of uzbekenergo ,  a state joint stock company . 
in the course of the negotiations ,  the afghan delegation affirmed its intention initially to import <num>150</num>  mw from the uzbek electricity transmission system ,  which could later increase to <num>300</num>  mw . 
the parties also commenced discussions on the construction of an electricity transmission line from surkhan to khairaton . 
the cost of the proposed construction is not yet known . 
the two sides have now reverted to the volume previously agreed upon . 
a source within uzbekenergo described the decision as having been taken at government level for political reasons . 
uzbekistans concern is that other central asian countries - tajikistan ,  turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan - have also begun exporting electricity to afghanistan . 
asian development bank is prepared to lend tajikistan <num>65</num>  $  million to increase the pace of construction on electricity transmission lines to afghanistan . 
these lines should be in operation by <num>2010</num>  .
tajik electricity will supply kabul ,  kunduz ,  pul-i-khumri and shirkhan-bandar . 
the total capacity of the lines will be <num>300</num>  mw a year . 
construction of the sangtuda hydroelectric power station on the river vakhsh in southern tajikistan ,  with a projected capacity of <num>650</num>  mw ,  will also help electricity supplies to afghanistan . 
for its part ,  kyrgyzstan has also offered afghanistan access to its energy resources in order to assist that countrys economic development . 
officials indicate that uzbekenergo itself intends to attract investment of <num>300</num>  $  million between <num>2008</num>  and <num>2010</num>  to be spent on implementing four different projects . 
a second infrastructure project is the <num>95</num>  $  million ,  <num>500</num>  kw high voltage line with an open distribution system at the sogdian-taliumarjan thermoelectric power station . 
it is anticipated these projects will be funded out of a total of <num>145</num>  $  million in loans from the islamic development bank and from existing resources . 
both projects have been included in the idbs working programme and it is anticipated this funding will be made available in <num>2009</num>  .
turkmenistans relations warm with the west ,  but cool with russia
kazakh magazine business week asserts that no one has accurately gauged or understands president berdimuhamedov of turkmenistan . 
 ( photo by sergey ponomarev / afp / getty images ) 
the april <num>14</num> -<num>17</num>  visit by <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  assistant secretary of state richard boucher to turkmenistan was a productive one and demonstrated the warming of relations between the two countries . 
these are not the best of times ,  however ,  for the countrys relations with its former big brother . 
turkmenistan continues to involve itself in the nabucco european gas pipeline project being implemented in spite of russia ,  insisted kommersant ,  a russian business publication . 
relations between the two countries have worsened on the gas front after the sudden reduction in gazproms purchases of gas from turkmenistan and the subsequent april <num>9</num>  explosion at the central asia-centre pipeline . 
the kazakhstani newspaper business week advised against drawing any conclusions about that ,  however ,  because ,  to date ,  no one has accurately gauged or understands berdimuhamedov - not americans ,  not europeans and certainly not russians ,  wrote the paper . 
every time politicians in different countries believe that berdimuhamedov is about to turn in their direction ,  according to business week ,  turkmenistan suddenly starts to champ against what it had apparently agreed only the day before . 
and the following day it will go over to the other side if berdimuhamedov suddenly determines that yesterdays allies are now unreliable and arrogant .

the pakistani military reported that it completed its operation to eliminate and expel militants in dir ,  and is now focusing on the buner district ,  abbas said . 
some <num>300</num>  militants entered the buner district a few days ago in violation of the taliban's recent agreement to pull out of the district ,  he said . 
buner is about <num>100</num>  km from islamabad ,  but abbas said the militants posed no threat to the capital city . 
pakistan insists there is growing popular support for its military crackdown and its efforts to take on the taliban . 
amnesty international's asia pacific director sam zarifi said he thinks the most important result of any military action against the taliban is  " whether the schools will once again open ,  whether the health units will once again operate .  "

during the visit to astana by iranian president ahmadinajhad at the beginning of april ,  nazarbayev said that  " if a nuclear fuel bank is created ,  we will be able to consider the possibility of locating it here ,  as we are a country that has signed the non-proliferation agreement and voluntarily forgoes nuclear weapons .  " 
immediately thereafter ,  the influential <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  newspaper the wall street journal cited an unnamed white house official as saying that president barack obama was seriously considering the kazakh leader's proposal . 
the newspaper opined that the kazakh proposal was an interesting one in part because kazakhstan was one of the few countries that once had nuclear weapons and destroyed them . 
kazakhstan is expected to become the world's largest uranium producer in <num>2009</num>  , passing canada and australia . 
according to estimates by the national uranium extraction company kazatomprom ,  about <num>12,000</num>  tonnes of uranium will be extracted in the country this year .

islamabad-there is no danger of taliban intrusion into islamabad ,  said acting interior minister rehman malik ,  talking to media on april <num>25</num>  .
he said the government has taken notice of challenging developments by taliban insurgents . 
malik said talibanization should end ,  not only end in mingora ,  but in every village . 
the taliban will have to vacate every occupied area ,  and the people of swat should desist from putting weapons into their hands . 
swat district coordination officer khushal khan said that following discussion taliban forces have agreed to go back . 
but the taliban spokesman in swat ,  muslim khan ,  said the taliban will not allow more government troops in the area and that the soldiers there must vacate the area as per the peace treaty . 
if the government does not comply ,  khan said ,  the taliban has the right to take action . 
chairing an operational meeting at headquarters ,  kayani said he was aware of the doubts being voiced about the intent and capability of the army to defeat the militancy in the country . 
he made it clear that the pakistan army never has and never will hesitate to ensure the safety and well being of the people and the countrys territorial integrity . 
meanwhile ,  local police reported militants blew up the building of nawazabad girls primary school in the jurisdiction of miryan police station . 
the explosion also damaged some houses and shops near the school . 
it is the fourth girls school that the taliban have destroyed in the area . 
tajik journalists mark world press freedom day
the right to criticise officials and the government and report such criticism openly in media reflects respect for freedom of speech and expression in society . 
 ( photo by yuri kadobonov / afp / getty images ) 
their discussions touched on a wide range of issues including abolishing the slander article in the tajik criminal code ,  the impact of the global crisis on tajik media and the ethics of freedom of speech in the country . 
with slander in the criminal code ,  reporters and media face harsh punishment if charged with committing it . 
even when it is objective and fact-based ,  persons identified in media reports can claim that they have been slandered by it . 
reporters know that slander identified as a crime imposes a severe limitation on freedom of speech because criticism can be interpreted as slander ,  and may be punishable by severe financial penalties and prison sentences .

a veteran of the great patriotic war watches the parade last may in dushanbe . 
dushanbe - tajikistan will mark the 64t anniversary of victory in the great patriotic war  ( wwii )  without the customary military parade ,  which was for many years a compulsory component of the public holiday .

other preparations for the holiday are also nearing completion . 
work is being completed on a white marble commemoration tablet in victory park and on a portrait gallery of heroes of the soviet union and recipients of military decorations from tajikistan .

baseball exotica in kazakhstan
little league baseball in almaty
thirty thousand dollars is about how much baseball costs in kazakhstan . 
according to the general secretary of the baseball federation of kazakhstan ,  mansur yarullin ,  this is exactly the amount that makes it possible to maintain and develop a whole year of little league in almaty ,  organise competition ,  conduct training ,  purchase equipment ,  and even transport a team from kazakhstan to the annual european and asian championship in poland . 
it is no coincidence that for many of these youngsters these things become the stuff of dreams . 
every year about <num>300</num>  children in kazakhstan play baseball . 
it is still quite an exotic kind of sport for kazakhstan . 
traditionally ,  the most popular sports here are football ,  boxing ,  and greco-roman wrestling . 
baseball stands every chance of becoming a real cult sport in kazakhstan ,  especially if one takes into account the overall influence of american cinema on the rising generation . 
it is well known that an enormous number of films in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  deal with baseball . 
the managers of some american companies and the representatives of various christian missions brought baseball to kazakhstan in <num>1995</num>  .
mainly through sponsor support from the chevron company and with active help from the little league in san ramon ,  california ,  an almaty little league was established . 
after chevron ended its sponsorship support ,  the kazakhstan teams for <num>2002</num>  and <num>2003</num>  stopped going abroad . 
it was only after exxon mobil began its sponsorship and support of baseball in <num>2004</num>  that the kazakhstan team again participated in international tournaments . 
however ,  since then ,  the chief representative of the company in kazakhstan has moved to the capital ,  astana ,  and exxon mobil has ended its sponsorship . 
another volunteer coach ,  anvar khodzhayev ,  believes that ,  for us baseball is not simply a hobby for a few thousand people ,  it is a cultural exchange ,  it is policy ,  it is positive americanism .

fights between groups of kurdish and kyrgyz teenagers occur repeatedly . 
makenbaeva said that during the most recent outbreak of inter-ethnic violence ,  law enforcement officials and local authorities made nationalist statements ,  which only increased ethnic tensions in petrovka . 
law enforcement authorities should end their searches for alleged third forces and stop blaming their problems on opposition intrigues ,  makenbaeva said . 
thats only a diversion from the true reasons for the petrovka conflicts ,  which pose a real threat to public safety .

she commented that ,  as part of the survey ,  the review group returned information on the accessibility of court buildings ,  the availability of information at the courts about their work ,  the condition of the courtrooms and degree to which they were technically equipped ,  and other unspecified issues . 
the research results showed that some courts do not comply with the legal requirement to guarantee the transparency of the legal process . 
thus ,  at one case heard in public at the khujand municipal court ,  the judge ,  having learned that observers were present ,  warned them that he was categorically opposed to the publication or distribution of any information obtained during the course of the proceedings . 
improvements are also needed when it comes to physical access to the courts . 
according to tatyana khatyukhina ,  a lawyer for the khujand office of chr ,  a turnstile was installed at the entrance to one court which made access difficult for the disabled ,  senior citizens and pregnant women . 
recommendations for improvements in criminal court practices in tajikistan have been developed based on the research results and will be made public by chr .

 ( photo by staff photographer  /  reuters )  . 
kyrgyzstan - speaking at a press conference recently ,  director of kyrgyzstans childrens rights defence league nazgul turdubekova called on international organisations operating in kyrgyzstan to support the creation of regional crisis centres for abused children . 
head of the countrys association of ngos and not-for-profit organisations toktaiym umetaliyeva ,  however ,  believes that a broader approach to domestic violence is needed ,  including sweeping changes to the medical and legal definitions of child abuse . 
at present ,  the childrens rights defence league is monitoring six cases they consider to be unambiguous examples of child abuse that law enforcement authorities seem to be in no hurry to investigate . 
police officers often consider abuse of children to be a strictly private family affair and do not like to interfere . 
its rare to see children as victims with rights in these cases ,  said turdubekova . 
development of banking sector in tajikistan
some foreign banks have already expressed an interest in the tajik market . 
these are mainly banks from countries that have already begun to invest assets in various other sectors of the tajik economy . 
a desire to be involved in the tajik market has been voiced by commercial banks in germany ,  pakistan ,  and kazakhstan . 
an independent expert on economic matters ,  sodik ismoilozoda ,  believes that it is the tajik banking industrys lack of healthy competition ,  as well as its freely moving resources ,  inadequate amounts of financial resources ,  and low interest rates for loans that opened the countrys financial market to foreign banks . 
in ismoilozodas words ,  the participation of foreign banks will be welcomed by the public and will accelerate national economic growth . 
mironenkov emphasised that the long-term and promising projects that the eurasian bank plans to invest in could include coal mines and the construction of smaller power plants in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan . 
during tajikistan president ,  emomali rakhmons visit to kazakhstan in may <num>2008</num>  , the kazakhstan-tajikistan investment fund was created with venture capital of <num>100</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  . 
rustam babadzhanov ,  an independent expert on economic affairs ,  notes that kazakhstan has at its disposal large amounts of liquid resources that should be invested in production . 
in this case ,  the neighbouring countries of tajikistan and kyrgyzstan are quite suitable for capital investments .

chairman of the committee for department heads and first deputy defence minister mukhtar altynbayev was named acting defence minister . 
during his two and a half years in office ,  akhmetov was called upon to resolve numerous problems in the kazakh army ,  both military and civilian in nature ,  such as providing housing for acting and retired officers .

the army is clearing out militants from the swat valley ,  and has been pounding strongholds of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud in the south waziristan tribal region bordering afghanistan in apparent preparation for a major offensive . 
zainuddin was gunned down in the nearby town of dera ismail khan . 
dr mahmood khan bitani said that he pronounced zainuddin dead on arrival at a local hospital with gunshot wounds to the head and chest . 
baz mohammad ,  an aide to the militant leader who was also wounded ,  said a guard barged into a room at zainuddins compound after morning prayers and opened fire . 
he accused mehsud of being behind the attack . 
mahmood shah ,  a former top security official ,  said the slaying sends a message to the government that they need to launch a strong ,  comprehensive operation to eliminate mehsud ,  described as the centre of gravity for much of the terrorist activity in pakistan . 
according to shah ,  baitullah mehsud has overcome all tribal dynamics . 
he has resources ,  funding and a fighting force to strike anywhere in pakistan . 
you simply cant eliminate him through local efforts ;  instead ,  you need a major force . 
meanwhile ,  five suspected aides of mehsud were arrested june <num>23</num>  in the southern city of karachi after an encounter with police ,  while six others escaped ,  according to police official raja omar khatab . 
the men are accused of involvement in robberies ,  kidnappings for ransom and other criminal activity to generate funds for mehsud ,  khatab said . 
pakistan to continue military operation until last taliban is tracked down
a tank drives along a street of a town in the swat region ,  june <num>13</num>  .
karachi - federal interior minister rehman malik said june <num>24</num>  that his government will continue its military operation until the last taliban is tracked down . 
addressing a press conference at parliament house ,  malik said the operation zone in malakand and swat had been cleared out and government forces are working to stop the taliban from regrouping . 
today ,  each and every pakistani citizen says no to taliban ,  he asserted . 
these fanatics have broken the hearts of so many mothers for using teenaged youngsters for suicide bombings . 
the terrorists who  [ wanted ]  to impose their own brand of islam on pakistani civilians have fled from swat after having shaved their faces and now are on the run . 
we will not let them stay anywhere and we will track them down . 
as conflicting reports come in ,  ambiguity prevails about the whereabouts of the swat tts chief and whether he is still alive or even still in the malakand district . 
almost a month ago there were initial media reports that fazalullah had been killed ,  but there was no official confirmation or denial of the reports .

kyrgyz opposition presidential candidate atambaev challenges president to debate
social-democratic party leader and unified opposition candidate in the upcoming presidential elections almazbek atambaev decided not to respond to attacks on him by official media . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
the decision is connected with the fact that lots drawn by the central election commission  ( cec )  have atambaev debating temir sariev on the air . 
ukpm is also worried that the cec decision to broadcast candidates speeches and debates in recorded form may lead to attempts to edit their remarks prior to air time . 
the kyrgyz opposition also accuses the authorities of using administrative resources ,  dishonest campaigning and possible ballot manipulation in the july <num>23</num>  vote . 
according to their information ,  government employees are being forced to promise to vote for the current president . 
state media give the lions share of broadcast time and newspaper column space to bakievs pre-election campaigning ,  while so-called black pr tricks are being used against the opposition candidate . 
in recent days ,  a series of media outlets have reported that atambaev spoke to voters in south kyrgyzstan while intoxicated . 
in response ,  the opposition accused the state tv channel of intentionally circulating video material to discredit the opposition leader ,  and threatened to sue .

projects bring progress to korengal valley
korengal valley ,  kunar - the afghan government and coalition forces are reaching out ,  more than every before ,  to residents of the korengal valley . 
government officials recently joined local leaders in opening the construction of a community meeting hall in aliabad village . 
the new korengal community centre will give korengalis a comfortable place to gather for meetings and celebrations . 
this was governor wahidis second visit to the notoriously dangerous korengal valley since taking leadership of the province late last year ,  and the first time that any government official has been this far into the remote valley . 
insurgents regularly hide among the population and use the rugged territory to plan and conduct attacks ,  but the government wants korengalis to see that they can turn to their leaders for help . 
since his last visit to the korengal ,  tribal leaders have come to asadabad many times to seek the governments assistance in solving their problems . 
in addition to the korengal community centre ,  the prt is constructing a new road connecting the korengal valley with the pech valley road . 
the road will provide korengalis with easy access to their provincial capital and to health and education services ,  and building it is employing hundreds of local men . 
it will also open up the valley and make it possible for security forces to conduct regular patrols into what has been ,  for years ,  a safe haven for insurgents . 
insurgents are threatening the road project by intimidating locals to stop them working on its construction . 
just last week an attack on construction workers killed one and injured two . 
but despite the risks ,  residents are seeing the clear benefits of development . 
tribal elder mahmad azim said ,  we are happy that we see reconstruction projects in our valley . 
the government and coalition forces are making schools ,  health clinics and roads for us and for our children . 
we promise to support our government . 
our enemies only want to destroy our country and kill our people ,  and we are very tired of their evil activities . 
government and <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  forces continuously communicate a simple message to korengalis :  afghanistan is developing - dont get left behind . 
if you want a good future for your children and you want to have roads ,  health clinics ,  and schools for your children ,  support our government and coalition forces . 
we are working for the people and we really need your support . 
we must stop the insurgents destructive activities and enemies that want to make security problems and kill our people ,  wahidi said . 
senator haji saleh mohammad saleh emphasized that people should defend themselves from insurgents . 
our enemies and insurgents have taken advantage of the korengal valley ,  and they hide themselves here ,  and do evil deeds against our government and people . 
dont let the enemies hide here and destroy your homes and kill your innocent people . 
trust your government - they are the servants of our people and they are working for you . 
like me ,  a lot of my villagers are working on the road construction project ,  which is going from pech valley up to korengal . 
our enemies dont want us to progress ,  but we will never allow them to destroy our country .

punjab government starts up e-databank
lahore-the punjab government on july <num>2</num>  announced the start-up of an electronically accessible resource ,  an e-databank ,  for districts to monitor government projects and ensure on-time completion . 
chairman of the chief ministers task force on information technology  ( it )  nadeem k . 
at a press conference ,  haq said every district would be provided uniform data software to update their progress in implementing provincial government programs using a web-based application running from the central server in lahore ,  the provincial capital . 
as punjab province has <num>36</num>  districts ,  it had become very difficult for the district governments to maintain checks and balances on all development projects . 
that is why we decided to develop a central control system . 
haq said there is no need for additional funds for the project . 
it centres with manpower and resources are already operational in each district . 
the e-databank will streamline the existing infrastructure with the application of new software that will make all data inputs uniform . 
the it centres of every district will upload performance and working data of their projects on daily basis . 
government leaders ,  including the chief minister and the provincial chief secretary will be able to see the daily reports of district it centres regarding current projects in the system ,  haq said . 
the e-database project should be completed by the end of the year . 
the e-databanks will enable the punjab government to hold districts to strict timetables for the completion of projects .

<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  investors have been working in the uzbek construction industry for a number of years . 
last year in tashkent ,  platineum partners put a drywall factory into operation with a capacity of <num>10</num>  million square metres per year . 
the construction of a cement company is a high economic priority for uzbekistan . 
the capacity of currently operating cement factories in uzbekistan is only <num>6.5</num>  million tonnes per year ,  while the demand will exceed <num>12</num>  million tonnes by <num>2012</num>  .
earlier ,  the construction of three cement factories funded by polish and korean investors was planned in the republic ,  but the projects ,  at a total cost of <num>650</num>  $  million ,  had to be halted when the uzbekistan government was unable to provide required financial guarantees due to the global economic crisis .

the majority of chechens and ingush ,  who were deported to central asia by soviet dictator stalin in <num>1944</num>  , returned to their homeland after <num>1957</num>  .
many ,  however ,  maintained strong ties to their second homeland . 
there are approximately <num>80,000</num>  chechens and a small number of ingush still living in kazakhstan today ,  according to official data . 
in addition ,  between <num>1994</num>  and <num>97</num>  , almost <num>100,000</num>  chechens came to kazakhstan as refugees . 
during the conflict in the caucasus ,  some kazakhstani citizens participated on the side of the separatists and some of the militant leaders had kazakh passports . 
the majority of separatist leaders ,  such as djokhar dudayev ,  aslan maskhadov and their contemporaries ,  were born in kazakhstan . 
in <num>2003</num>  , it came to light that movladi udugov ,  a separatist ideologue and fundamentalist ,  obtained a kazakh passport from the pavlodarsk regional migration police in <num>2001</num>  using the name bile .

kyrgyzstan attempts to establish national version of islam

 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - religion ,  law and politics ,  an independent research and analytical centre ,  has announced that it is working on a new concept for kyrgyz national islam . 
the centre began developing a new concept for religious policy and development with the presidential secretariat and the institute for strategic analysis . 
while islam is not generally divided into national schools ,  there are four principal juridical sunni schools - hanafi ,  maliki ,  hanbali ,  and shafii - that interpret the dogma in sunni islam on a liberal-conservative spectrum . 
according to malikov ,  many kyrgyz mullahs who trained in arab countries or pakistan in the past returned home preaching conservative views of islam that were alien to kyrgyz muslim traditions . 
since independence after the end of the soviet era ,  kyrgyzstan has been working to restore the hanafi understanding of islam and maintain national traditions that do not contradict the fundamental canons of the religion . 
malikov said research shows that the muslim community in kyrgyzstan supports constructive interaction and cooperation with the state . 
it sets social ,  not political goals ,  he stressed . 
against this background ,  however ,  there are an increasing number of reports of extremism and a weakening of the authority of traditional spiritualism in kyrgyzstan . 
in june alone ,  security forces shot nine militants who were members of the banned ,  extremist islamic movement of uzbekistan and islamic jihad . 
the hizb ut-tahrir party is another underground movement that the government considers extremist . 
officials and experts claim that the party now has between <num>10,000</num>  and <num>15,000</num>  followers in kyrgyzstan .

washington - the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  extended condolences to families of the <num>168</num>  people feared dead in the crash of a caspian airlines plane in north-western iran on july <num>15</num>  .
while the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  has not had diplomatic relations with iran over the past <num>30</num>  years ,  the obama administration considered it appropriate to reach out to the iranian people with this gesture . 
 " the united states extends it condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in today's crash of a caspian airlines plane carrying passengers from tehran ,  iran to yerevan ,  armenia ,  "  state department spokesman ian kelly said . 
news reports said the plane carried <num>153</num>  passengers and <num>15</num>  crew members . 
officials reported that the plane crashed <num>16</num>  minutes after takeoff from tehran's imam khomeini international airport and that everyone on board was killed . 
the united states severed relations with tehran <num>30</num>  years ago during the <num>1979</num> -<num>1981</num>  hostage crisis ,  in which a group of militant iranian students held <num>52</num>  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  diplomats hostage at the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  embassy for <num>444</num>  days .

 ( photo by ontustik social entrepreneurship corporation press office ) 
families in rural areas and towns who own their own homes and have backyards will be given broiler chicks to raise and a supply of chicken feed . 
after two months ,  the chickens will be returned to the service procurement centre . 
deputy prime minister umirzak shukeev called the idea a superb example of a simple way to make money during the crisis . 
the first incubation centre is expected to produce <num>236,000</num>  chickens per year . 
our prices are <num>15</num> -<num>20</num>  percent lower than market prices ,  or about us$0 . 85 per chicken . 
he added that if fed adequately ,  chickens will put on two kilogrammes of weight in two months . 
a kilogramme of chicken meat will earn us$2 . 
processed and packaged carcases will be sold <num>15</num> -<num>20</num>  percent lower than market prices . 
the projects creators estimate that increases in its sales will ultimately lead to a fall in the market prices paid by consumers . 
by comparison with the cost of starting up a poultry farm ,  which includes design ,  construction ,  equipment ,  employees wages and taxes ,  the incubation units costs are minimal ,  and some costs are eliminated altogether .

this architectural ensemble is comprised of a <num>91</num> -metre-tall column with a mythical phoenix on top and a <num>120</num> -metre-long colonnade .

international terrorists active in central asia
citizens of kyrgyzstan ,  kazakhstan and uzbekistan were among the militants arrested in kyrgyzstan . 
kazakhstan - kazakh ministry of foreign affairs press secretary ilyas omarov announced that a militant killed in july on the border between chechnya and ingushetia who had a kazakh passport was not a citizen of the republic . 
a probe to establish how he obtained the passport is now under way . 
omarov acknowledged ,  however ,  that one militant arrested in neighbouring kyrgyzstan this month on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activity is a kazakh national . 
this was not the only example of international terrorism in central asia in recent months .

opposition wants kyrgyzstan presidential election declared invalid

almazbek atambayev ,  the main opponent of kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  leader of the social democratic party ,  who is the sole candidate representing all opposition parties ,  said on election day ,  july <num>23</num>  , that he considers the elections invalid due to numerous manipulations during voting organised by the authorities . 
atambayev said at a press conference that due to the huge number of violations in the conduct of the election ,  the voting should have been suspended and new elections should be called . 
the head of his election headquarters said opposition observers were recalled from the ballot sites . 
atambayevs call to halt the voting and call new elections was supported by another candidate ,  zhenishbek nazaraliyev ,  a substance abuse doctor . 
this election was held for the sake of an election ;  it was a fiction ,  he said . 
i think they will probably declare the elections honest and legitimate . 
after journalists interpreted those statements to mean that atambayev and nazaraliyev had withdrawn their candidacies ,  the social democratic party press service denied that , saying the matter involved only non-recognition of the results of a manipulated election . 
the massive extent of violations of election law during todays voting ,  which are the fault of the central electionl commission and executive power ,  makes it impossible to declare presidential elections legitimate ,  the two candidates said in a joint statement posted on the social democratic party web site . 
atambayev also called on his supporters to protest today or tomorrow ,  if necessary ,  to demonstrate that we dont consider the elections legitimate .

uzbekistan increases electricity delivery to afghanistan
 ( photo by shah marai / afp / getty images ) 
uzbekistan began supplying electricity to afghanistan in early <num>2002</num>  , soon after <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  forces and the anti-taliban coalition defeated taliban forces and unseated the fundamentalist regime ,  which controlled almost <num>90</num>  percent of the country at the time . 
since then ,  despite some shutdowns ,  the export of uzbek electricity to afghanistan has grown steadily . 
in <num>2007</num>  , uzbekistan exported <num>20</num>  mwh to afghanistan . 
by the end of the year ,  the export will grow up to <num>300</num>  mwh . 
according to uzbekistans state statistics committee ,  almost <num>2.5</num>  percent of the country's total foreign trade is with afghanistan . 
the total supply of energy comprises more than <num>21</num>  percent . 
the capacity of uzbekistan's <num>39</num>  thermal and hydroelectric power plants exceeds <num>12.3</num>  million kw ,  or about half of the generating capacity of the united energy system of central asia ,  which includes turkmenistan ,  tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan and southern kazakhstani energy supplies . 
cost of living increases rapidly in kyrgyzstan
kyrgyzstans government is attempting to rein in price hikes through state regulation . 
 ( photo by romeo gacad / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstans government is attempting to rein in price hikes through state regulation of domestic markets . 
but according to economist zulfiya kumarbekova ,  kyrgyzstans domestic growers and producers supply only a small portion of total demand ,  the bulk of which is filled by imports of many types of food . 
even the smallest changes in world market prices are enough to adversely affect kyrgyzstans weakened economy ,  she says . 
with the economic crisis sapping the countrys hard currency reserves ,  kyrgyzstans government has understandably turned to protectionist measures in order to prop up domestic producers ,  which has had the unintended consequence of generating inflationary pressures in the prices of food staples . 
in may ,  the administration signed a decree to limit wheat flour imports for six months . 
kyrgyz prime minister igor chudinov said ,   " we'd like to see local producers import wheat instead of importing flour .  " 
authorities have also moved to protect domestic sugar producers through import quotas . 
only two companies are now authorised to import sugar ,  and the price for sugar has climbed to us$1 per kilogramme ,  up from <num>0.70</num>  $ -<num>0.80</num>  just a few months ago . 
in some places ,  authorities have resorted to declaring bans on price hikes . 
osh mayor melis myrzakmatov ,  for example ,  did so for the prices of bread ,  meat and public transportation ,  and formed a special commission to enforce the bans .

the persecution of journalists in central asia is not unusual . 
here protestors voice support for kazakh political writer sergei duvanov .

the prosecutor was seeking a prison term of <num>14</num>  and half years for saiid . 
based on precedent ,  the sentences handed to journalists are fairly harsh - at least <num>10</num>  years . 
but considering there is a thaw in uzbekistan ,  the punishment for saiid could be parole ,  according to his lawyer ,  rukhitdin kamilov .

the main construction work was completed last year ,  and the stations first three hydro turbine units were also launched then . 
the total cost of the station is more than us$700 million ,  the largest tajik-russian joint project in recent years . 
station <num>1</num>  general director rakhmetulla alzhanov told journalists that its projected output capacity of <num>670</num>  mw will be reached two months after the reservoir is filled . 
according to alzhanov ,  sangtuda hydroelectric station <num>2</num>  , which was built by iranian specialists ,  will be launched during the next two years . 
once it becomes operational ,  tajikistans electrical supply problems will be completely resolved . 
electricity will be supplied <num>24</num>  hours a day ,  even during winter frosts ,  he said . 
tajikistan is not eager to lose control over its energy sector . 
as tajik foreign minister khamrokhon zarifi said recently ,  dushanbe is ready to involve russian companies in the rogun hydroelectric station project and other important hydroelectric facilities ,  but only as past of an international consortium and without handing over a controlling stake . 
tajikistan attempts to limit spread of hemorrhagic fever
according to mirzoyev ,  the situation is under control ,  and <num>11</num>  medical teams have been dispatched to potential flashpoints . 
an emergency response centre in tursunzade has been set up to act as a regional information centre to direct these measures . 
otherwise known as crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever  ( cchf )  ,  the illness is seasonal in nature and is caused by tick bites . 
with the hay and grain harvests at hand ,  more labourers work in the ticks' natural habitat ,  and doctors fear that the number of people infected with cchf will continue to rise . 
agricultural fieldwork is still mostly carried out by hand ,  and this greatly increases the chances of workers being bitten by ticks . 
this year ,  tajikistan has already vaccinated residents of the country's most tick-prone regions ,  including tursunzade . 
another <num>5,000</num>  doses of vaccine are on their way from iran . 
in addition ,  the country's animal control bureau is standing by ,  ready to run a tick-eradication programme in the affected area for the second time this year .

at the end of july ,  the anti-corruption agency filed a criminal case against abduaziz fuzailov ,  director of another medical college located in khujand ,  on suspicion of receiving a series of bribes from graduates . 
its hard to name an educational institution where corruption and bribe-taking are considered unacceptable ,  one observer said . 
other sources report that dishonest teachers demand bribes from students to accept them during the admissions process and to obtain higher grades in end-of-semester exams . 
students prefer to keep quiet about the size of the fees ,  and as a rule ,  only appeal to law enforcement in cases where their wallets are strained . 
according to anti-corruption department director fatokh saidov ,  <num>408</num>  cases of corruption were uncovered in the first half of the year . 
of those ,  <num>115</num>  were classified as serious ,  <num>157</num>  were connected with the misappropriation and spending of government budgetary funds and <num>68</num>  were connected with bribe-taking . 
during the same period ,  there were <num>178</num>  criminal investigations ,  <num>150</num>  of which led to court cases .

karachi - smuggled cars like prado ,  pajero ,  land cruiser and mercedes are being sold at rock bottom prices in pakistan ,  auto dealers say . 
the same kinds of markdowns are available on mercedes ,  toyota ,  and other makes . 
leaders of terrorist outfits are using smuggled cars ,  and few dare to report them ,  faraz khan ,  another car dealer said . 
according to him ,  people are hoping that after a period of two to three years ,  tax authorities will declare amnesty for the owners of smuggled cars if they pay a nominal customs duty and sales tax . 
processing cotton in tajikistan
according to khisaynov ,  this programme is aimed at reducing exports of raw cotton ,  and it also envisages the creation ,  within the republic ,  of additional production capacities to process more than <num>200,000</num>  tonnes of raw cotton annually . 
cotton harvesting
figures from the countrys ministry of agriculture show that the annual output of raw cotton is about <num>420,000</num>  tonnes ,  and after it has been ginned ,  it is possible to obtain something on the order of <num>160,000</num>  tonnes of fibre . 
of this ,  more than <num>85</num>  %  is being exported in its raw form . 
the remainder is processed at <num>18</num>  textile plants . 
forecasts from the ministry of agriculture state that by <num>2015</num>  the production of raw cotton in the country will reach <num>650,000</num>  tonnes  ( more than <num>200,000</num>  tonnes of clap fibre )  ,  thanks to the increase in productivity ,  the growth of new varieties of cotton crops ,  and the introduction of drip irrigation . 
the area now sown to cotton is <num>257,300</num>  hectares and the ministry does not plan to increase it . 
in order to create conditions favourable to attracting a large number of investors in light industry ,  the countrys government has decided to exempt those participating in this programme from some taxes and customs duties . 
khisaynov emphasises that in accordance with this programme ,  each investment project involving exemption from taxes and customs duties will be considered individually . 
privileges and tax exemptions are envisaged mainly when technological equipment is imported . 
sodik ismoilzoda believes that these measures may be inadequate ,  and that the government should create an investment climate ,  fully insure raw materials for producers ,  and provide opportunities by limiting deliveries of foreign textiles on the home market . 
according to him ,  these measures will promote investments in these sectors and full implementation of the programme ,  and will also provide support for the home producer and create protections for the home market against poor quality goods . 
in khisaynovs opinion ,  the state will promote investments in every possible way to implement this programme because it has an interest in increasing textile production and creating new jobs ,  particularly for the rural population . 
in the market ,  abdulov says ,  the most important thing is to produce competitive output in terms of both price and quality . 
abdulov says that the company plans to start up a weaving shop and ,  within five years ,  move on to the full cycle of fibre processing so as to bring the raw materials to a finished state and export them . 
it is essential to enter the market with a good quality product so as to deal with the competition from well-known foreign producers . 
in the opinion of karamali asanaliyev ,  the deputy chairman of the chamber of commerce ,  in order to increase the production of textiles and sell them it is necessary to create ,  within the country ,  joint ventures with large world companies . 
this step will make it possible to solve the problem of marketing the output produced because the well-known world producers already have sufficiently large markets ,  and opening up new ones is not very difficult for them . 
women in kyrgyz village demand houses be built for them
according to gulzhamal zhoroyeva ,  the osh regional state administration press secretary ,  the road is now open .

during a meeting with village residents ,  state construction committee chairman kanybek narbayev promised them that they would be holding housewarming parties by <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
he is certain that construction will be completed by autumn ,  particularly as there are no problems with funding . 
the ministry of finance is allocating the necessary resources in a timely manner . 
according to narbayev  ,  the delay in delivery of the housing materials from china was tied to the recent ethnic conflicts in urumchi ,  but he says there is no longer a delay . 
almazbek osmonov ,  the head of the alaisk region ,  added that the construction of other infrastructure facilities will also be completed by that time ,  including public baths ,  an exercise facility ,  a health clinic ,  electricity lines and water pipelines .

the school was funded by the central mosque and kmsu ,  a civic organisation fully supported by the government .

afghans defy taliban to vote in kandahar ,  elsewhere in the south
kandahar ,  afghanistan - dressed in a flowing green burqa ,  an afghan woman cast her vote in thursdays presidential election and began furiously wiping her ink-stained finger with a tissue . 
the indelible ink afghanistans election commission insists is necessary to prevent people from casting a ballot more than once also makes it obvious that a person has voted . 
the taliban threatened to cut off the fingers or slit the throats of those with ink-stained index fingers . 
here in kandahar ,  hundreds of people defied them despite dozens of rocket ,  mortar and rocket-propelled grenade attacks on the city throughout the day . 
ahmed wali karzai ,  chairman of the kandahar provincial council and half-brother of the president ,  said ,  we had several explosions through the morning . 
last night there was firing but that didnt stop people from coming out . 
five years ago ,  the high turnout of voters in kandahar helped elect hamid karzai to the presidency . 
but despite encouraging signs early on ,  continuous violence depressed the vote and even the busiest polling station was operating at less than a third of its capacity . 
turnout in kandahars rural districts was expected to be even lower . 
although a gun-battle raged for most of the day in the northern city of baghlan ,  killing eight ,  turnout elsewhere in the north was brisk . 
uzbekistan has started to build its part of the turkmenistan-china gas pipeline
on june <num>30</num>  , close to the village of sayet in the dzhondorskiy region of the bukhara district ,  a start was made on the uzbek section of the turkmenistan-china gas pipeline . 
the cost of this section will be <num>2</num>  $  billion  [ usd ]  ,  according to the official figures . 
earlier ,  turkmenistan and china signed a contract for the construction of a gas pipeline with a throughput capacity of <num>30</num>  billion cubic metres of gas annually for a period of <num>30</num>  years . 
demand in china for natural gas is enormous . 
the blue fuel now makes up a total of <num>1.5</num>  to <num>2</num>  percent of the prcs energy requirements . 
initially ,  because of the complicated relations between the countries of central asia ,  various different versions were considered - including bypassing uzbekistan . 
however ,  it soon became clear that that plan was not feasible ,  particularly considering the safety concerns involved with having to ,  in order to bypass uzbekistan ,  run the pipeline through afghanistan . 
construction of the gas pipeline was started in june ,  and the main construction is planned for the second half of <num>2008</num>  .
before january <num>2009</num>  , the first sections of the pipeline are scheduled for completion ,  while a compressor station is to be brought on line in january . 
in order to solve the complex tasks associated with construction uzbek president ,  islam karimov ,  ordered the recruitment of experts from abroad ,  and a division of responsibilities among the various ministries and departments . 
the current plan is for the pipeline to exclusively transport turkmen gas . 
chairman of the board at uzbekneftegaz ,  nurmukhammad akhmedov ,  reports his company plans to obtain up to <num>1.5</num>  $  billion during <num>2010</num>  to develop the pipeline export systems ,  and reconstruct the major internal lines in uzbekistan . 
in june <num>2006</num>  , the chinese signed an agreement with uzbekneftegaz to conduct geological survey work within the boundaries of the ustyurt ,  bukharo-khivinsk ,  and fergana hydrocarbon areas . 
from <num>2006</num> -<num>2008</num>  , seismic-survey work is being conducted over an area of <num>8.32</num>  thousand square kilometres . 
there are plans to drill <num>12</num>  wells for evaluation ,  costing <num>88.3</num>  $  million . 
if new energy deposits are found ,  the chinese and uzbekneftegaz will set up a joint enterprise to exploit them . 
uzbekneftegaz - a monopoly operator for uzbekistans hydrocarbon complex-was set up in <num>1998</num>  and includes six joint-stock companies . 
in terms of natural gas extraction ,  uzbekistan is in the top ten in the world . 
each year about <num>60</num>  billion cubic metres of natural gas is extracted ,  some of which is exported .

turkmenistan - the turkmen government has imposed an unspecified ban on studying abroad . 
in several cases ,  students who had been accepted for study ,  were cleared for travel by the ministry of education and had valid visas in their passports were actually pulled out of their seats on the flights that were to take them to the universities where they planned to study . 
the chronicle of turkmenistan website reported that the parents of students studying at the american university of central asia in bishkek were summoned to the education ministry and were told that their children would not be allowed to leave the country for study there . 
the officials said that the turkmen government has no need for academic specialisations acquired abroad . 
students intending to study abroad were also summoned to the national security ministry on several occasions . 
you can get called in several times a day ,  one student studying in kyrgyzstan said . 
they demand information on the university ,  what we are studying ,  who we associate with in bishkek ,  our addresses ,  where and with whom our parents work ,  and they write down their work phone numbers . 
some analysts suggest that turkmen officials are afraid of the liberalism of foreign academic programmes and that study abroad denies students the opportunities to study the collected works of the late turkmenbashi and those of current president gurbanguly berdymukhamedov .

blasts kill <num>40</num>  in kandahar
the simultaneous detonations of five car bombs in the southern city of kandahar destroyed the offices of a japanese construction company ,  killing women and children and wounding at least <num>64</num>  people in the bloodiest terrorist attack since july last year . 
the bombs exploded shortly after dusk as people broke their ramadan fasts with iftar meals . 
agha lalai ,  another council member ,  said the blast felt like an earthquake . 
the power went off and there was a huge explosion . 
deputy kandahar police chief fazel ahmad shairzad said police did not yet know what the target was and were investigating the bombing . 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility ,  but a government spokesperson blamed the attack on taliban-linked groups . 
kyrgyzstan constructing highway to bypass uzbek settlement
orders were given to expedite construction of a road bypassing an uzbek settlement . 
 ( photo by joe raedle / getty images ) 
the lack of a bilaterally recognised administrative border in the ferghana valley was not critical during the soviet era ,  but created <num>58</num>  disputed border areas between kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan when the former soviet republics gained independence in <num>1990</num>  .
as a result ,  the uzbek settlements of shakhimardan ,  sokh ,  kalacha and dzhangail ,  and the tajik settlements vorukh and west kalacha have developed on territory claimed by kyrgyzstan in the ferghana valley . 
the kyrgyz settlements of barak and tajik sarbak are located on land uzbekistan claims as its own . 
border disputes are further exacerbated by the economic interdependence of these regions . 
a large portion of the population depends on trade with neighbouring territories . 
smuggling often causes incidents in which citizens of both countries have been injured or killed . 
uzbek citizens threw rocks at a kyrgyz border point in late july following the arrest of two residents on the border in the sokh settlement that the new road will bypass . 
two border guards were injured in the event . 
nato is building a radioactive waste processing plant in uzbekistan
the north atlantic alliance plans to build a plant to neutralise and process radioactive waste from fuel in uzbekistan ,  jaman jeter ,  nato coordinator for central asia announced at a press conference . 
according to jeter ,  the plant will be built in aktashkiy region in samarkand district in uzbekistan . 
in addition ,  jeter reported in accordance with an agreement between the nato leadership and uzbekistan ,  the plant to neutralise the radioactive fuel waste from space rockets may be brought on line in september . 
jeter said the cost of the plant would be <num>1</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  . 
in the aktashkiy region in samarkand district ,  there is a large expanse of territory where ,  during soviet times ,  radioactive fuel waste was dumped . 
this means nato will not build ,  but rather restore and reconstruct a plant that already exists for neutralising the fuel waste . 
earlier ,  in soviet times ,  this plant was used to process the fuel waste from space rockets that included the highly toxic substance heptyl . 
it is proposed that after the plant has been brought on line ,  in addition to the radioactive waste ,  it will also process spent fuel from reactors . 
kuvandik sanakulov ,  the general director of the navoiskiy mining ,  reported that in august ,  in order to build up output volumes and exports of precious metals ,  the president of uzbekistan issued a decree confirming a programme for modernising the plant and technological equipment until <num>2012</num>  .
according to the iaea ,  uzbekistan is seventh in the world in terms of uranium reserves ,  and fifth for extraction . 
about <num>40</num>  uranium deposits have been surveyed in the country but only <num>27</num>  of them have really rich deposits . 
according to figures from the state committee for geology and mineral resources information centre ,  surveyed and evaluated uranium reserves amount to <num>185,800</num>  tons . 
in <num>2007</num>  uranium recovery in uzbekistan grew <num>0.5</num>  percent to <num>2,270</num>  tons . 
uzbekistan does not have its own nuclear industry and all the low-enriched uranium is exported .

 " and it's made our lives easier . 
we now have our <num>45</num> -day vacation and our workload has been reduced .  " 
however ,  the new law places significant restrictions on turkmen citizens wishing to study abroad . 
they may now do so only under direct bilateral agreements between the institution and the foreign government body responsible for education . 
in other words ,  turkmenistan's ministry of education will decide not only where students who want to study abroad will be able to study ,  but also what they will study .

making clay pottery is one of the oldest occupations of mankind and the potters wheel is probably one of humanitys earliest inventions . 
over generations ,  pottery making has evolved from a simple craft into a highly specialized aesthetic expression . 
its a family enterprise ,  said the white-bearded craftsman . 
while men prepare the clay ,  work the moulding ,  and fire the pottery ,  women and children embellish it with motifs while glazing . 
finished handmade pottery items on display . 
 ( photo by syeda zahra ) 
the potter caste is integral to the working class ,  and over time has become cultural trait of a historic tradition ,  said kaku ,  another potter . 
low income persons are our main customers ;  they cant afford contemporary utensils ,  he said . 
because they dont demand high quality workmanship ,  pottery making has slipped into complacency . 
earthen pottery for cooking is an art that has almost vanished in modern times . 
kunar people are very poor but they are very good people . 
they remember good deeds . 
if you work honestly with these people ,  they will always help you . 
sayed fazlullah wahidi helped establish health clinics and schools in kunar in <num>1992</num>  with a humanitarian organisation . 
now he is back as governor of this mountainous border province . 
in a place where rule by the gun is common ,  governor wahidi brings years of experience in administration and civil society . 
he took office in november of <num>2007</num>  , and has made waves ever since . 
kunar is bustling with activity ,  from civil service reform to more than <num>60</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  in development projects from the provincial reconstruction team  ( prt )  . 
he works closely with the prt on development and security ,  and has paved the way for numerous new projects . 
he explained :  i am a man who is always walking around outside ,  to the project sites ,  meeting with the people . 
i believe the governor should be in close contact with the people . 
as for the prospects for peace in kunar ,  the governor is cautiously optimistic . 
he has backed up his words by visiting some of the most dangerous places in afghanistan to meet with elders and seek solutions to conflict . 
already this year ,  he has been to the korengal valley twice . 
and he intends to involve the population as much as possible in the process .

kazakhstan - ten border guards were killed and three injured in the crash of a national security committee  ( nsc )  border service mi-8 helicopter in southern kazakhstan . 
regional nsc deputy director karim baltabayev said seven of the dead were contract soldiers and three were officers ,  including the head of the south regional division of the border service ,  colonel ruslan zakiyev . 
the helicopter crashed on september <num>8</num>  at <num>10</num>  : <num>30</num>  <abbr>am.</abbr> 
local residents and forest workers in the area told the emergency situations ministry they saw a tower of smoke in the gorge . 
preliminary reports said the helicopter either crashed on landing or hit a cliff with its tail and went down . 
the three survivors were taken to shymkent and sent to almaty for further treatment . 
the helicopter with <num>13</num>  members of the arlan reconnaissance group from the southern saryagash border service was headed for the uzbek border . 
the nsc said kazakhstan had received information from tashkent that six armed men were trying to cross into the country in that region . 
the south border service organised several groups to locate them . 
one ,  carrying out an aerial search in an mi-8 ,  located the suspects in the mountains ,  but crashed . 
deputy director of the kazakh border service amangeldy abylkanov said that on ascending they discovered five individuals moving along the gorge . 
group leader colonel ruslan zakiyev then gave the command to find a place to set the helicopter down . 
the individuals spotted by the helicopter have not been located . 
hundreds of afghan votes declared invalid
a donkey cart passes an election poster for president hamid karzai in kabul . 
 ( reuters / ahmad masood ) 
the complaints commission said it is ordering the elections panel to invalidate the results from the five polling stations in paktika because of evidence that  " the ballots were not legally cast ,  or were not legally counted .  " 
for example ,  the result sheet in one ballot box affirmed that it contained <num>550</num>  ballots for a candidate ,  but there were only <num>35</num>  ballots for him in the box ,  the commission said . 
other ballot boxes contained hundreds of votes for certain candidates ,  but none were folded ,   " proving they were not cast through a ballot box slot ,  "  the commission said . 
it is still investigating more than <num>2,000</num>  complaints of voter fraud since the election ,  including more than <num>700</num>  it has deemed  " priority <abbr>a.</abbr>  " 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ambassador to afghanistan karl eikenberry called on karzai to allow the elections panel to investigate vote fraud thoroughly and determine which votes are valid . 
karzai said he is sure there was fraud in the election ,  but that such fraud is something that cannot be avoided in a growing democracy . 
he told paris daily le figaro that there was also election fraud in the <num>2004</num>  presidential election ,  and that there will be fraud in the future . 
he also said he would respect the final election results . 
uzbek environmentalists demand technical inspection of tajik and kyrgyz hydroelectric plants
the accident at the sayano-shushensky hydroelectric plant ,  russias largest ,  left more than <num>70</num>  people dead . 
in addition ,  machine oil that spilled into the yenisei river caused extensive environmental damage .

dushanbe - chairman of the executive committee of uzbekistans environmental movement boris alikhanov has called for an international inspection of hydroelectric plants being built in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan . 
he is also calling for a complete inspection of all functioning hydroelectric plants at major reservoirs in central asia ,  primarily tajikistans nurek and kyrgyzstans toktogul hydroelectric plants . 
uzbek environmentalists fears were realized on the august <num>18</num>  when an accident occured at russias sayano-shushensky hydroelectric plant ,  listed in the guinness book of world records as the most massive structure of its type . 
alikhanov said that russia has invested heavily in the repair and maintenance of the plant ,  and that the accident that claimed lives and caused extensive environmental damage could not have been prevented . 
environmental activists question whether tajikistan and kyrgyzstan are operating their large hydroelectric plants according to specifications ,  as they try to resolve their energy problems . 
the <num>2007</num>  accident at pamir-1 was serious ,  causing the plant to flood and knocking out one of the power generators . 
fortunately ,  no one was killed in either accident . 
kazakhstan :  social problems associated with musical culture
every year in kazakhstan ,  classical culture ,  classical music and the theatre fail to find adequate economic support . 
whereas pop artists can boast of fairly generous earnings ,  classical ,  folk and other non-mainstream musicians rely on subsidies ,  primarily from the state . 
in order to have the opportunity to perform ,  to improve ,  or simply to maintain their level of professional expertise ,  musicians often play in different venues and / or seek sponsorship . 
for kazakhstani performance artists and musicians ,  about <num>90</num>  percent of their income is sourced from concerts ,  night club performances and appearances at private parties . 
whereas the domestic scene may be enough for many pop performers ,  classical musicians have to be able to perform abroad in order not to lose their level of professional expertise . 
each such performance is a way of presenting kazakhstan to its advantage and of showing that the country has its own musical school . 
however ,  for musicians ,  every trip abroad and every concert is associated with a - largely unsuccessful - search for potential sponsors . 
this is the case despite the fact that musicians are not asking for very much . 
for example ,  producing <num>500</num> -<num>1000</num>  copies of a classical album recorded live at a concert costs less than <num>10,000</num>  $  .
but it is rare that one finds sponsors willing to invest money in a performer . 
there are exceptions ,  however . 
a kazakhstani brewing company recently funded a <num>10,000</num>  $  project by edil khusainov which permitted him to record his first album . 
the second major problem is a lack of instruments . 
once they have completed their studies at music school ,  many talented children are unable to find the necessary funds to purchase their own instruments on which to continue to play . 
dana meirbekova ,  a musicologist and the director of the korkyt foundation ,  says :  in our country ,  classical musicians work purely for the love of music . 
it is probably only in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and europe that classical musicians have the opportunity to earn money . 
 [ even though ]  the hall was full ,  we made no money out of our anniversary concert ,  which included performances by ilya grubert and akhan meirbekov . 
russian musician ilya grubert and the talented young kazakhstani musician akhan meirbekov
however ,  musicians ,  artists and other interested parties confirm that this is still not enough . 
the ministry of culture itself calculates that the current level of funding - <num>0.2</num>  %  of gdp - must be increased to at least <num>1</num>  percent . 
punjab invites malaysian firm to construct housing
punjab faces a shortage of five million housing units . 
 ( photo by asif hassan / afp / getty images ) 
we have approached the executive chairman and invited their management team to visit lahore for this purpose ,  said punjab board of investment and trade vice-chairman pir saad ashanuddin on september <num>4</num>  .
the visit is likely to expedite the construction of <num>20,000</num>  low-cost housing units in lahore ,  multan ,  bahawalpur ,  faisalabad ,  sargodha ,  gujaranwala ,  rawalpindi and sialkot ,  the eight major cities in the punjab province . 
with an estimated population of <num>82</num>  million ,  the province is a facing shortage of five million housing units . 
every year ,  the demand for additional housing exceeds <num>700,000</num>  units . 
compared to the huge demand ,  the government has been able to provide only <num>150,000</num>  units annually . 
the government has therefore targeted state land to build quality housing for low and middle income families ,  which will involve private sector financial institutions . 
renexus ,  a leading malaysian construction company that uses state-of-the-art building technologies and other industrialised methods to ensure good quality workmanship and faster construction ,  has taken the lead in the effort . 
 " the gap between supply and demand in the housing sector will be met by public and private partnerships ,  with the government serving as enabler ,  regulator and facilitator ,  "  said qazi in a statement to the press . 
kazbrig could be deployed to afghanistan

more than <num>1,300</num>  soldiers from the <abbr>u.k.</abbr>  ,  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and puerto rico are participating in the exercise on the iliysky air force range in kazakhstan . 
more than <num>100</num>  ground vehicles and military transport aircraft units are also involved . 
ambassador hoagland announced that steppe eagle <num>2009</num>  aims to train and promote self-evaluation of the second kazbrig battalion to ensure that its soldiers are prepared and capable of carrying out a variety of missions . 
the training began with a military exercise to liberate and de-mine a town that had been captured by terrorists ,  before ensuring the safe return of the civilian population . 
kazbrigs soldiers demonstrated a high level of teamwork ,  smooth coordination and good combat know-how ,  the kazakh ministry of defence press office stated . 
rumours that kazakhstan was considering sending soldiers to afghanistan began circulating immediately thereafter . 
last november ,  at the nato parliamentary assembly ,  former secretary of state kanat saudabayev  ( now minister of foreign affairs )  said that astana would like to increase the overall level of its support for peacekeeping operations in afghanistan after having posted soldiers in iraq . 
the deployment would have kazbrig working in military hospitals and international security assistance force  ( isaf )  headquarters in kabul . 
vienna - iranian nuclear energy chief ,  ali akbar salehi ,  has agreed to new terms of cooperation with the uns international atomic energy agency in its investigation into tehrans nuclear activities ,  a top iranian official asserted in vienna on september <num>15</num>  .
increasing concern about irans push for nuclear capability resulted in the scheduling of talks on october <num>1</num>  .
salehi declined to say what the new terms of cooperation entailed ,  except that it would not cover the iaeas probe into intelligence reports suggesting that iran covertly researched nuclear weapon designs . 
iran asserts the reports were fabricated and considers the issue closed . 
we managed to come to an agreement to set a new framework for better and deeper cooperation in the future ,  salehi told reporters ,  summarising talks with iaea chief mohamed el-baradei during the annual meeting of the agencys <num>150</num>  member states . 
details will be revealed at the appropriate time . 
we hope we will witness improved cooperation  [ with the iaea ]  in the future . 
we also think the international environment is very helpful in this issue . 
eu foreign policy chief javier solana ,  who led western negotiations with iran ,  told reporters in brussels that the talks will probably be held in turkey . 
he said that this was not the appropriate time to talk about sanctions ,  however . 
at this point in time we are going to try to enter into negotiations ,  he said . 
lets leave it at that . 
in another development ,  the russian foreign ministry said on september <num>15</num>  that iran is ready to hold constructive talks with the p5+1 next month after it submits new proposals regarding its disputed nuclear programme . 
the iranian package reflects a desire to have deep and constructive talks with the six ,  foreign ministry spokesman andrei nesterenko said .

kohat ,  pakistan - a suicide car bomber killed at least <num>25</num>  people in northwest pakistan on <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
<num>18</num>  in an explosion on a road that brought down nearby shops ,  police and witnesses said . 
the bomb went off on a main road near the city of kohat ,  <num>150</num>  kilometer  southwest of islamabad . 
kohat is a garrison town close to the ethnic pashtun tribal belt on the afghan border ,  which is a major sanctuary for militants battling in both pakistan and afghanistan
 " a restaurant and many shops have collapsed . 
it's chaos here . 
 " my house is one kilometre away ,  but the blast felt as if it was next door ,  "  he said . 
mehtab-ul-hasan ,  senior administrator of the region where the blast took place ,  told reuters that <num>25</num>  to <num>30</num>  people had been killed . 
 " twenty bodies are lying beside me ,  "  hasan said by telephone . 
the area where the attack took place is mostly inhabited by minority shi ' ite muslims . 
there has been sectarian violence in the region in the past . 
taliban militants are from the majority sunni community and attacks on shiites are part of their strategy to fight the government . 
militants have struck with bombs numerous times since intensifying their war against the government in <num>2007</num>  but have suffered set backs this year ,  raising government hope that the security forces are getting the upper hand .

development of the mining industry in tajikistan
the bolshoy koni mansur ,  one of the largest silver deposits in the world ,  was surveyed in the <num>1970</num>  second  and <num>1980</num>  second  . 
its reserves total <num>1</num>  billion tonnes of ore with a silver content of <num>49</num>  grams per tonne ,  and also <num>0.49</num>  percent lead and <num>0.38</num>  percent zinc per tonne . 
its total reserves of silver exceed <num>50,000</num>  tonnes . 
tajik experts confirm that there are considerable financial costs associated with developing the bolshoy koni mansur deposit ,  and that its development is only possible through the creation of a consortium . 
creation of the enterprise would be a condition of the bidding because the government is counting on the creation of new jobs and on exporting a finished product . 
the need to create a consortium has created considerable interest in the republics mineral deposits on the part of foreign companies ,  particularly british ,  kazakh ,  russian ,  and chinese firms . 
the prospects for future development of the countrys mining industry will depend on this .

tajikistan - on september <num>18</num>  , tajikistans department of constitutional guarantees of citizens rights and the un high commissioner of refugees met in dushanbe to discuss the status of stateless individuals in the republic . 
unhcrs representative in tajikistan ,  ilya todorovich ,  noted that following the dissolution of the ussr ,  the legal status of thousands of people came into question in many former soviet republics . 
he said that tajiks who left the country during or after the civil war in the <num>1990</num>  second  are now classified as stateless ,  both within the republic and abroad . 
unfortunately ,  there is currently no complete or accurate statistical information on stateless individuals in tajikistan ,  but the official number of <num>117</num>  cases does not reflect the real situation . 
high-altitude pipeline to supply gas to fergana valley in uzbekistan
the new gas pipeline was constructed by experts from four countries . 
the project commissioned by the uzbek oil and gas enterprise is truly international . 
its experts developed the design of the pipeline . 
engineering plans were drawn up by their colleagues at the russian firm nipi inzhgeo . 
it will supply <num>24</num>  million cubic metres of gas a day during the winter ,  and up to <num>30</num>  million cubic metres during the summer . 
this construction is a significant feat ,  says uzbek economist viktor ivonin . 
gas pipelines <num>1.2</num>  metres in diameter have never before been laid in such adverse mountain conditions . 
the leader of the christian party ,  marat zahidov ,  said the old petroleum pipeline that ran through the valley during the soviet era passed through tajikistan . 
because the governments of the two neighbouring countries were unable to agree on numerous issues ,  particularly those relating to energy ,  uzbek taxpayers had to pick up the us$493 million bill for the construction of the high-altitude gas pipeline that does not pass through tajik territory . 
the blind seek two percent job quota in pakistan banking sector
karachi - blind pakistani citizens are seeking a two percent job quota in banks ,  said amir ashraf ,  general secretary of the pakistan association of the blind  ( pab )  on september <num>17</num>  .
a few days ago ,  we met the chief of the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  ,  syed salim raza ,  in karachi and requested he implement the governments decision to grant a two percent job quota for blind pakistanis in public sector organisations ,  ashraf said . 
there are hundreds of blind citizens who can join banks after an initial training ,  said pab finance secretary muhammad hussain . 
we have informed the sbp that if banks continue to ignore the quota ,  the pab will take up this issue with the prime ministers office and the supreme court . 
he also pointed out that the blind face problems in opening personal accounts in banks ,  as well as obtaining credit cards and loans in the wake of a recent directive of the sbp . 
death toll rises in pakistan bombings
peshawar ,  pakistan - pakistans security forces braced for more attacks by taliban fighters avenging military action against them ,  as the death toll from the most recent suicide bomb blasts rose to <num>27</num>  , police said . 
<num>26</num>  , the first on the outskirts of bannu ,  close to the rugged tribal region of north waziristan ,  where al-qaeda and the taliban rebels are holed up . 
bannu police chief mohammad iqbal marwat said his office sent human flesh and other body parts for a dna test to identify the suicide bomber . 
the pakistani taliban have claimed responsibility for the bannu attack and threatened to unleash greater assaults on government targets to avenge the killing of their leader baitullah mehsud in a strike in august by an unmanned aircraft . 
despite a new code of conduct reportedly penned by mullah omar mohamed ,  forbidding attacks on civilians ,  pakistan has been hit by a wave of bombings that have killed more than <num>2,100</num>  people in the last two years . 
pakistani pro-government leader assassinated
 " the bomber rammed his explosive-laden car into the vehicle carrying abdul hakeem and his two guards ,  killing them on the spot ,  "  said wali hayat khan ,  a police official in the region ,  referring to the tribal elder . 
attacks on the taliban in their south waziristan stronghold have also reassured the west of pakistan's commitment in the fight against militancy ,  although the army has yet to launch a ground offensive into waziristan . 
pakistani action in its northwestern region is vital to nato efforts to gain control over an intensifying taliban insurgency in afghanistan .

six kazakhs convicted of planning terrorist acts
the six aktyubin residents were convicted of terrorism ,  the illegal manufacture and possession of weapons ,  ammunition ,  explosive devices and materials ,  robbery ,  inciting minors to commit crimes and illegal distribution of material advocating cruelty and violence . 
the six rural residents were accused of planning to blow up oil facilities in the aktyubin region . 
mugalzhar district prosecutor balgan teleu asserted that the accused carried out field exercises and studied books on elementary military tactics and building weapons . 
teleu said that all the convicts were members of a wahhabi community . 
in kazakhstan ,  followers of the extreme conservative khanbalit mazkhab branch of sunni islam are known as wahhabis . 
supporters of conservative muslim communities in western kazakhstan charge kazakh security services with discrimination ,  alleging provocation and the fabrication of criminal cases against them . 
unfortunately ,  the trials inaccessibility  ( only one relative was allowed into the court )  ,  the haste with which it was conducted and the populations lack of faith in the methods used by the domestic security services have turned public opinion against the sentence . 
tehran - ali akbar salehi ,  head of iran's atomic energy organisation ,  told the english-language service of state-owned press tv that iran would soon inform the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  of when it could inspect its newly revealed uranium enrichment facility . 
foreign ministry spokesman hasan qashqavi maintained that the missile tests had nothing to do with tensions over the nuclear site and were part of routine ,  long planned military exercises . 
this explanation was rejected by the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and its european allies ,  who called the tests  " provocative in nature .  " 
the head of the iaea said iran violated an iaea provision on the disclosure of the construction of an uranium enrichment facility . 
iran's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said he considers the talks a positive  " opportunity "  for participating nations . 
salehi also said iran will not discuss anything related to its right to enrich uranium . 
western representatives vow to raise the issue ,  however .

lahore - islam has always encouraged art and creativity ,  and muslims should learn and practice subjects such as art ,  said well-known pakistani scholar javed ahmed ghamidi ,  addressing an audience at the opening of an exhibition of calligraphic paintings by pakistani artists at the ejaz galleries in lahore on <abbr>sept.</abbr> <num>18</num>  .
muslims have created masterpieces of art and civilisation in the past ,  and are equally well-regarded today for their artistic talent in calligraphy ,  he said . 
ghamidi added that the exhibition illustrates the rich potential and talent of contemporary master calligraphers and painters ,  who are attempting to keep the art form alive .

courting a big future for tennis in turkmenistan
the fate of tennis in turkmenistan is as unusual as it is traditional in terms of the historical circumstances of its existence . 
tennis is an expensive sport and it requires a significant investment in infrastructure and funding for its development . 
since preference used to be given to team sports ,  tennis ,  because of its individual nature ,  was largely ignored in terms of financing . 
turkmenistans junior tennis team
after the break-up of the soviet union ,  turkmenistan gained its independence and started a new life . 
in <num>1991</num>  , the national tennis centre was set up ,  and it immediately joined the international tennis federation  ( itf )  . 
despite the setbacks ,  the turkmenistan national tennis centre gained confidence ,  and eventually became a full member of the itf . 
since <num>1993</num>  , tennis courts have been built all around turkmenistan ,  and in the capital particularly ,  the number of courts has been increasing every year . 
a complex of tennis courts ,  which was built near the olympic stadium in ashgabat ,  made it possible to hold international tournaments in turkmenistan ,  and to train players to a level necessary to compete internationally . 
since many officials are also avid tennis supporters ,  the national tennis centre receives support from the government . 
this is essential for participation in international tournaments ,  and also for funding and construction of new facilities . 
this year construction of an indoor court began . 
more than <num>50</num>  coaches work at the national tennis centre . 
some ,  including former turkmen champion dzhennet khalliyeva ,  are licensed as international coaches . 
two-time tennis champion of turkmenistan nastya prenko
after her first triumph in chimkent at the 18t international junior tournament ,  in which almost <num>150</num>  players from central asia took part ,  nastya continued her training in ashgabat with professional coach nelli grigoryevna voinich . 
four tajik minority languages on verge of extinction
dushanbe - participants at an international scholarly conference on disappearing languages and history concluded that four languages of tajik national minorities are on the verge of extinction . 
the conference ,  organised by the tajik academy of sciences and the international foundation for endangered languages ,  took place in early october in khorog . 
it drew participants from a number of european and asian countries . 
according to foundation official nicholas ostler ,  there are more than <num>6,000</num>  languages in the world on the brink of disappearance . 
yagnob ,  according to ostler ,  is only spoken by approximately <num>500</num>  people living there . 
the other <num>8,000</num>  yagnobs live elsewhere in the country or abroad and no longer speak their native language . 
three other endangered languages also have less than <num>1,500</num>  speakers each . 
according to a unesco estimate ,  one language in the world fades out of existence every week . 
with each language ,  a community and whole strata of world culture also disappears . 
the specific knowledge developed and shared by the group ,  based on centuries of observation of flora ,  fauna and the weather ,  vanishes . 
therefore ,  conference participants said ,  states where endangered languages are spoken must do everything in their power to preserve them . 
denmark satisfied with military partnership with tajikistan
danish foreign minister per stig moller recently visited tajikistan . 
 ( photo by reuters / ints kalnins ) 
tajikistan also plays an important role in solving problems in the central asian region ,  and denmark therefore believes it is important to develop its bilateral relations with the central asian nation . 
tajikistan helps afghanistan in terms of transport ,  communications and low-cost electricity ,  and we are supporting the republic of tajikistan in this respect ,  moller stated . 
several danish c-130 hercules military cargo aircraft currently engaged in military operations in the afghan province of helmand use the services of dushanbe airport ,  and receive support from a french military force also stationed there . 
dushanbe airport is also used by american and german aircraft for refuelling . 
the two nations examined the issue of global climate change as well . 
the danish foreign minister said he invited president rahmon to attend an international climate change conference in copenhagen in december ,  and revealed that he had accepted the invitation . 
glacial melting and the use of water and energy resources in central asia are issues of specific concern to tajikistan . 
tajik ecologists say that the impact of climate change and glacial melting is becoming more important every year . 
pamir mountain glaciers ,  the main source of drinking and irrigation water in central asia ,  have melted rapidly over the past decade . 
current estimates indicate that more than a thousand glaciers in tajikistan are likely to disappear in the near future ,  as a result of climate change . 
pakistani commandos stormed an office building and rescued <num>39</num>  people taken hostage by suspected taliban militants after an attack on the army hq . 
at least <num>19</num>  people died in the clash ,  including three captives and eight of the militants ,  who wore army fatigues . 
the rescue operation began before dawn ,  ultimately freeing <num>42</num>  hostages ,  the military said . 
the government said the siege had only strengthened its resolve to launch an offensive in south waziristan ,  a tribal region along the afghan border and a major militant stronghold . 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and pakistan's other western allies want islamabad to take more immediate action against insurgents ,  who are responsible for increasing numbers of attacks on nato troops in afghanistan . 
no group claimed responsibility ,  but authorities said they were certain that the pakistani taliban or an allied islamist militant group were behind the attack . 
explosions and gunshots rang out just before dawn ,  as commandos moved into a building in the complex and a helicopter hovered in the sky . 
three ambulances were seen driving out of the heavily fortified base close to the capital ,  islamabad . 
two hours after the raid to recapture the compound began ,  two new explosions were heard . 
the army said it was  " mopping up "  the remaining insurgents . 
overall ,  at least <num>19</num>  people died ,  including six soldiers ,  two commandos ,  eight militant attackers and three captives ,  and several others were wounded . 
abbas identified the captured man as aqeel ,  alias  " dr usman ,  "  and described him as  " the leader of the group . 
 "  the name matches that of a militant suspected of orchestrating an attack in lahore earlier this year on sri lanka's visiting cricket team . 
a week ago ,  baitullah mehsud's successor ,  hakimullah mehsud ,  told journalists summoned to a briefing in south waziristan that the taliban would launch more attacks on military ,  government and other targets in the country .

he said talko will also sponsor the participation of athletes in training programmes ,  finance athletic equipment purchases and restore and repair sports fields and stadiums . 
the value of the sponsorship will be approximately half a million <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollars a year . 
negmatov added that companies have helped athletes in specific international competitions in the past ,  but their support generally did not continue into the next season and therefore did not contribute to improving the skills and capabilities of individual competitors or national sports teams . 
representatives of various sports organisations claim that sports are in critical condition in tajikistan . 
it has serious problems equipping sports teams and sports centres . 
radovan karadzic ,  the bosnian serb warlord indicted for war crimes ,  has spent the past <num>12</num>  years living and practising as a specialist in alternative medicine . 
karadzic ,  aka dragan dabic ,  was arrested on july <num>21</num>  by serbian special forces as he travelled by bus from his belgrade apartment on yuri gagarin street to another belgrade suburb . 
it is being suggested that his arrest came after a tip from an un-named foreign intelligence agency . 
a comparison made on july <num>31</num>  shows two pictures of former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic  :   ( at l )  appearing at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ,  and  ( at r )  in a recent handout photo released on july <num>22</num>  , in belgrade .

he is one of the most prominent balkan war crimes suspects arrested since the late serbian president slobodan milosevic was tried before the hagues international court on genocide charges in <num>2001</num>  .
a bosnian forensic expert working during the exhumation of a mass grave site discovered <num>5</num>  km away from the centre of srebrenica ,  <num>120</num>  km north of sarajevo . 
forensic experts completed the exhumation of this mass grave believed to contain several dozen bosnian muslim victims of the <num>1995</num>  srebrenica massacre . 
afp photo  ( afp / getty images ) 
he is about the same age ,  but lives in a remote part of serbia with no television ,  phone or computer . 
karadzic even had his own web site  ( http :  /  / dragandabic . 
com )  ,  which was written in both serbian and english . 
the homepage is headed ,  healing from within :  the ever increasing need for alternative viewpoints in the modern world . 
the web site claimed he travelled around india ,  japan and finally settled in china where he specialised in alternative medicine ,  with a special emphasis on mind-body control ,  meditation ,  and spiritual cleansing . 
he then returned to serbia in the mid-1990s and emerged as a prominent expert in the field of alternative medicine . 
the web site also contains what he claims are ancient chinese proverbs ,  specially selected by him . 
among the proverbs is ,  he who cannot agree with his enemies is controlled by them . 
and the most bizarre one ,  the one ,  who turns in his own ,  shall dig two graves . 
serbia is currently seeking membership of the european union ,  and is trying to clean house by arresting the more notorious criminals of its civil war to improve its chances for admission . 
it is therefore expected that karadzics military commander ,  mladic ,  will be found and arrested soon . 
the way of life of many nomadic groups in the xinjian-uighur autonomous region of china and mongolia has not changed much over the centuries .

the archaeological monument was found in the kurgaldjin reserve by a hunter on <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>5</num>  .
he said he found three multicoloured stones that he sent to astana to be examined by experts . 
the mausoleum itself was destroyed long ago ,  as none of the local long-time residents knew of its existence . 
only notes of 18t and 19t century russian travelers make vague mention of the site . 
archeologists hope to recreate the appearance of the vault using computer simulations . 
they also promised to conclude the investigation and publish their findings within a year . 
double bombing kills <num>11</num>  at pakistani police station
the afternoon attack targeted a heavily fortified police station next to a mosque in the main city of pakistan's taliban-riddled northwest frontier province . 
a car filled with explosives drove to the main gate of the police station ,  as a motorcycle carrying a man and a woman pulled up behind it ,  peshawar police chief liaquat ali khan said . 
the impact of the blast destroyed part of the police station and the mosque next to it ,  he said . 
the blast killed <num>11</num>  people ,  including three police officers ,  two women and two children ,  khan said . 
another <num>15</num>  people were wounded ,  officials said . 
but the use of a female suicide bomber is extremely rare here ,  and could signal a new tactic by the extremists . 
the pakistani army has given no time frame for the expected offensive in south waziristan . 
it has reportedly already sent two divisions totaling <num>28,000</num>  men and blockaded the area . 
kitchen art cafe appeals to osh residents
culinary artists from california hard at work in osh . 
gerome waag and daniel gallegos ,  who initiated the project ,  regard cooking as an art . 
waag says that they wanted to familiarise themselves with different cultures through cooking ,  particularly the most common dishes of local cuisine ,  and at the same time study other elements of local art . 
in his opinion ,  they have succeeded in doing so in osh . 
according to project coordinator tamara kadyrbayeva ,  the idea to open an art cafe at the ancient osh bazaar originated during her visit to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  in <num>2008</num>  .
she states that osh is not only the culinary capital of the ferghana valley but of all kyrgyzstan . 
that is why waag and gallegos selected it out of all other venues proposed to them by their american colleagues . 
the art cafe was an old part of the ancient osh bazaar .

three others were also charged in the case ,  including his deputy alzhan braliev ,  who received a two-year conditional sentence ;  zeinulla sarsembaev ,  who received a three-year conditional sentence and adil zhaiylganov ,  an official of the mercury plus company who received the harshest verdict ,  six years imprisonment and the confiscation of his property . 
in addition ,  the court ordered mercury plus to pay the government <num>5.8</num>  $  million and a state duty of <num>173,000</num>  $  .
at the very end of the trial ,  zhaiylganov publicly admitted that he was the author of an anonymous letter that led to the initiation of the criminal investigation and the arrest of the ecology minister . 
the former minister ,  initially called the organiser of the crime by the prosecutor general ,  insisted that he had had no direct participation in government purchases and no say in the flow of funds . 
during the trial ,  his role was recast as that of co-conspirator . 
radio azattyk  ( freedom )  wondered why during four months of court hearings and expert testimony it never became clear what harm was done to the state by those charged with embezzlement .

the dahla dam is located on the arghandab river ,  <num>20</num>  miles north of kandahar city . 
it is the second largest dam in afghanistan . 
eighty percent of kandahars population lives along the irrigation system ,  according to canadian government figures . 
the dam is considered the most vital piece of agricultural infrastructure in kandahar province . 
the importance of the dam to the future of the region makes it a potential target for the taliban ,  admitted canadian brigadier-general gerry champagne ,  at a july <num>16</num>  briefing in ottawa .

pakistan on high security alert
prime minister yousuf raza gilani condemned the bloodshed ,  saying that the string of attacks had made the government even more resolute in our commitment to eradicate the evil of militancy . 
two weeks ago ,  a band of insurgents laid siege to the armys fortress-like headquarters in rawalpindi and held dozens of people hostage . 
in successive assaults ,  militants have simultaneously attacked three security installations in lahore ,  and bombed an army convoy and a police station . 
authorities believe that many of the bombings in pakistan that have taken the lives of many civilians are being planned by al-qaeda and taliban militants in the lawless tribal region of south waziristan ,  where the pakistani army started an offensive on <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
thousands of pakistani women trained as textile workers
karachi - the textile skill development board  ( tsdb )  has produced <num>5,000</num>  skilled female textile workers in last few years in collaboration with the textile industry ,  according to textile commissioner idrees ahmed . 
federal minister for the industry ,  rana farooq saeed khan ,  chairman of the pakistan readymade garments manufacturers and exporters association ,  mohsin ayub mirza ,  and senior representatives of the industry also attended the ceremony . 
the textile industry has been facing a skilled labour shortage in recent years . 
with the support of the industry ,  the tsdb is making strenuous efforts to train the numbers of women required to meet the growing demand for skilled textile workers ,  ahmed said . 
the need is greatest in the production of garments ,  a leading export industry . 
ahmad said the board was planning to set up more training centres ,  including some in rural areas ,  to produce an even larger force of skilled female workers . 
speaking earlier ,  saeed said the government had allocated millions of dollars to support research and development in the industry . 
the government announced its textile policy last july to enhance exports from the current us$10 billion to <num>25</num>  $  billion over the next five years ,  he added . 
during the ceremony ,  chairman mirza announced that a two-month specialist training course in the use of various mechanical stitching machines would soon be implemented ,  to provide skilled employees for the garment industry . 
he said the units established at the epz in karachi would ensure jobs for all women completing their training in future .

viva kaz vegas ? 
the deal is part of an ambitious plan to build a new resort that has been dubbed by some as kaz vegas . 
the new city ,  officially called zhana ile ,  is part of the grand plan of president nursultan nazarbayev to develop the countrys economy and diversify it away from oil and gas . 
visiting the area on july <num>24</num>  , nazarbayev said :  were always looking for investors to ensure that a big entertainment complex is successfully established on the right shore of the lake  [ kapshagay ]  . 
now a serious american company which has participated in the construction of las vegas has shown a great interest . 
eighth wonder ,  which could not be reached for comment ,  is best known as the company behind the new york ,  new york hotel and casino in las vegas . 
eighth wonder has not fared so well since opening the new york ,  new york in january <num>1997</num>  .
the consortium lost out to a group headed by genting international . 
an attempt to open east village ,  another new york-themed complex in las vegas ,  also ended in failure . 
tony illa ,  writing in the las vegas business press in march <num>2007</num>  , reported that advents group pulled out of the project because of spiralling costs and a failure to attract investors . 
however ,  the news that eighth wonder are on board the kapshagay project will be welcomed by kazakhstans high rollers . 
since april <num>2007</num>  , when all casinos in kazakhstan were forcibly closed down ,  the countrys gamblers have had to visit neighbouring kyrgyzstan ,  which has witnessed a boom in new casino openings ,  or risk visiting the underground gambling dens which have sprung up all over kazakhstan in order to try their luck . 
a january <num>2007</num>  directive limited gambling to two zones - one at kapshagay in the south and another in shchuchinsk on lake burabay near the capital ,  astana ,  in the north . 
the project was dubbed las vegas on the steppe ,  or kaz vegas for short .

the new criminal code will require a court warrant before a search can be made . 
 ( photo by mario laporta / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - deputies from tajikistans lower house of parliament voted unanimously in favour of a bill to introduce a new national criminal procedure code . 
the code currently in effect was passed in <num>1961</num>  and is outdated . 
the bill gives the courts broader powers . 
the prosecutor general currently performs these functions ,  which has been criticised by experts . 
legal expert firuz nidoyev said that courts ,  rather than prosecutors ,  issue arrest warrants elsewhere in the modern world . 
justice minister bakhtiyor khudoyorov stressed that a group that included members of the government ,  parliament and law enforcement bodies worked on the bill for two years . 
international human rights conventions ratified by tajikistan and the countrys constitution obliged us to develop new legislation ,  he said . 
communist party chairman shodi shabdolov noted that the new code will be life-changing for all residents of tajikistan . 
he called on deputies and reporters to conduct an extensive campaign to explain the essence and significance of the new code to the public . 
deputy yusufdzhon akhmedov said money should be found in the federal budget to print several thousand copies of the new criminal code and make it accessible to most citizens . 
the legislation is widely expected to be approved at all levels . 
under that assumption ,  the lower house of parliament voted unanimously to have the new code come into effect on april <num>1</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
medical e-learning requires a higher degree of interactivity than other types of on-line education . 
french ambassador to pakistan daniel jouanneau inaugurated the video conferencing ,  also known as e-learning ,  in a health facility to mark ten years of teamwork between pims and saint antoine hospital in paris . 
in december <num>2000</num>  , a medical intensive care unit  ( icu )  established in pakistan with french assistance initiated the joint project . 
since then ,  the facility has provided care for more than <num>3,500</num>  patients . 
a broad range of e-learning modalities has already been integrated into medical education in many medical schools around the world . 
the recent emergence of virtual universities promises a revolutionary approach to training medical professionals using cutting-edge ,  e-learning technologies . 
medical e-learning involves a higher degree of interactivity than other types of on-line education . 
medical students will be able to observe medical procedures in real time ,  allowing them to focus on specific symptoms and treatments ,  and be able to ask professors questions about them . 
senior professors from saint antoine hospital attended the inaugural ceremony virtually ,  by videoconferencing from paris with the office of the president of the french society of critical care medicine . 
a pakistani refueling his car with cng at an islamabad filling station last july . 
the federal ministry for petroleum and natural resources cited international association of natural gas vehicles  ( iangv )  statistics showing that pakistan now has the largest number of cng-powered vehicles in the world ,  ahead of brazil and argentina for the first time . 
pakistan also boasts the largest number of cng filling stations in the world ,  with <num>17,000</num>  at present ,  and a further <num>200</num>  being built . 
that does not take into account the more than <num>4,000</num>  investors who have expressed interest in getting into the business . 
natural gas has replaced not only petrol ,  but also diesel in pakistan ,  as a large number of vans and mini-buses have also converted to cng . 
in <num>2009</num>  kazakhstan intends to become first in the world in terms of uranium recovery ,  mukhtar dzhakishev ,  the president of the kazatomprom national company ,  announced at a press conference in astana . 
as is known ,  uranium deposit reserves in kazakhstan amount to <num>1.69</num>  million tonnes ,  which constitutes <num>21</num>  percent of world reserves  ( second only to australia )  . 
the uranium business in the country was set up in <num>1997</num>  by the kazatomprom national company . 
properly speaking ,  there is no doubt that kazakhstan may very soon overtake both canada and australia in terms of volume . 
one feature of kazakhstans uranium deposits is that it is possible to recover ore relatively cheaply and in large volumes . 
kazakhstans main competitors are forced to extract ore using a considerably more expensive mining method . 
in addition ,  kazatomprom and the french company areva plan to build a plant to produce fuel assemblies-the final product of the nuclear fuel cycle . 
areva will provide technical support in setting up a production facility for finished fuel assemblies with an annual capacity of <num>1,200</num>  tonnes . 
it is proposed that the french company will invest <num>90</num>  $  million in the uranium recovery project in kazakhstan . 
similar contracts have also been concluded with japan and russia . 
in the opinion of dinara bisembinova ,  an observer with the newspaper liter ,  france and japan have achieved a breakthrough in the kazakhstan market . 
literally all the leading countries in the world ,  including the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  have an acute need for uranium fuel ,  and their interest in kazakhstans deposits is understandable .

tajikistan - tajikistans centre for anti-corruption education and propaganda and the russian commission to fight corruption signed a cooperation agreement in moscow in october . 
aliakbar abdulloyev ,  general director of tajikistans anti-corruption centre said the two organisations would assist each other in training personnel and holding conferences ,  seminars and roundtables on fighting corruption . 
he said the russian commission also planned to open an office in dushanbe . 
the sum included about <num>3.2</num>  $  million in misappropriated federal money and assets ,  <num>6.6</num>  $  million in illegal state spending ,  <num>1.2</num>  $  million in losses and <num>1.5</num>  $  million in tax evasion . 
independent experts say the anti-corruption department is working hard to fight corruption but believe that investigators are arresting mainly university and school teachers ,  doctors ,  lawyers and judges . 
higher ranking officials are rarely brought to trial ,  but this is not because corruption has been eradicated at the top levels .

journalism in kyrgyzstan can be a deadly profession
zhurnalisty expert bakyt ibraimov claimed that the number of unpunished crimes against journalists in kyrgyzstan is on the rise . 
unfortunately ,  authorities always claim they are personally motivated and are unrelated to their work . 
if this continues ,  political journalism will cease to exist in kyrgyzstan before long . 
no one will write critical or analytical pieces on politics and society any more ,  and media on the whole will cover little more than sports and entertainment ,  head of zhurnalisty marat tokoyev contended . 
the following proverb demonstrates the place that the horse occupies in the life of a turkmen :  on getting up in the morning ,  greet your father ,  and then your horse . 
for a turkmen ,  the horse is always almost a member of the family . 
it is the horse that is the first helper of the horseman in the desert ,  persevering without water or food over enormous distances . 
thanks to their combination of regal bearing ,  gracefulness ,  lightness ,  and strength of motion the heavenly horses were famous far beyond their own land . 
the average lifespan of an akhal-teke horse is <num>25</num> -<num>30</num>  years when well looked after . 
feeding the thoroughbreds has always been a subject of special care . 
the travel reports from the english geographical society state that the turkmens prepare the feed for each horse individually ,  and they are never fed human food scraps . 
at the modern complex ,  the daily diet of the horses consists of clover ,  barley ,  carrots ,  melons ,  granulated sugar ,  raw eggs ,  fish fat ,  combined fodder ,  fish meal ,  and calcium-rich and phosphorus-rich ground fish bones . 
a team of five veterinarians looks after the health of the akhal-teke . 
a special polyclinic has been fitted out with the latest scientific and technological equipment . 
there is a diagnostic room for the four-legged patients that even contains surgical equipment . 
fortunately ,  this particular provision has not been used up to now ,  but it could happen ,  the riders say . 
a special account is taken of the active stallions ,  the keepers of the akhal-teke gene pool . 
the breeding experts in the commission from the turkmen altary state association carefully monitor the genealogy of these bloodlines . 
up to the age of six months the stallions live with their mothers in spacious yards ,  then this next generation of akhal-teke are moved to individual yards where they are looked after with all care and effort . 
thousands of years at the heart of the national culture has nurtured not only race horses but also their instructors-the seyis ,  kakamurad agamuradov ,  the chief seyis said . 
thanks to their skill ,  the champions of the akhal-teke are known throughout the world .

the first project is the establishment of a state mortgage company in bishkek and osh ,  where <num>150</num>  thousand square metres of housing are to be built . 
mortgage payments will be no higher than rental payments ,  and will allow buyers to become outright owners of the homes they purchase within ten to <num>15</num>  years . 
the second project is a state-run microcredit company aimed at development of the countrys agrarian sector . 
under the programme ,  farmers and farm workers will be given access to inexpensive loans and other monetary resources to assist them ,  increase agricultural productivity and raise their incomes . 
the fourth project includes structural and operational reforms of the existing agricultural production corporation  ( apc )  ,  which will convert it into a monopoly buyer of all farmers and smallholders agricultural production and in that capacity serve as a market regulator . 
bakiev said ,  this will enable the apc to make appropriate interventions in the market to prevent speculators from driving up prices . 
agency deputy director azamat dikambaev noted that lobbying on behalf of ministries and departments to the detriment of broader national interests would cease . 
we shall work out development scenarios for the country ,  strategic recommendations on kyrgyzstans positioning in the regional and global economy and proposals to minimise risks and threats ,  dikambaev added . 
within the agency ,  it was pointed out that regional economic development projects will now be coordinated from the centre and that the agency intends to carry out a review of the effectiveness of all the countrys investment projects .

punjabs governor says democracy being strengthened in pakistan
pakistans governor of punjab salman taseer addressing the media . 
lahore - only a democratic government can improve the national economy and ensure the security of the country ,  said punjab governor salman taseer on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
uniting the nation on one platform against terrorism is the achievement of a democratic government ,  he said . 
whether it is national security or solutions to economic problems ,  only a democratic system can cope with these issues effectively . 
it is a good sign that democracy is gradually being strengthened in pakistan and all institutions are working freely . 
the governor said the entire world supports democratic development in pakistan ,  particularly the international friends of pakistan who are offering financial assistance to strengthen the democratic system in the country . 
pakistan is passing through a very critical phase ,  and…the government will make every effort to improve the countrys economy ,  taseer said . 
he also said the government is committed to providing all possible support to the trade community to increase pakistans export earnings . 
various measures taken by the present government to support the countrys economy are fruitful . 
foreign remittances have increased significantly and the nations foreign exchange reserves have risen to us$14 billion ,  up from just <num>6</num>  $  billion several years ago . 
tripoli ,  libya - from within libya's most secure jail ,  a new challenge to al-qaeda is emerging . 
the new code ,  a <num>417</num> -page religious document entitled  " corrective studies "  is the result of more than two years of intense and secret talks between the leaders of the lifg and libyan security officials . 
the code's most direct challenge to al-qaeda is this :   " jihad has ethics and morals because it is for god . 
that means it is forbidden to kill women ,  children ,  elderly people ,  priests ,  messengers ,  traders and the like . 
betrayal is prohibited and it is vital to keep promises and treat prisoners of war in a good way . 
standing by those ethics is what distinguishes muslims' jihad from the wars of other nations .  " 
the code has been circulated among some of the most respected religious scholars in the middle east and has been given widespread backing . 
it is being debated by politicians in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and studied by western intelligence agencies . 
while the code states that jihad is permissible if muslim lands are invaded ,  the guidelines it sets down for when and how jihad should be fought ,  and its insistence that civilians should not be targeted are a clear rebuke of the goals and tactics of bin laden's terrorist network . 
given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent jihadists in the middle east have turned against al-qaeda ,  the lifg's about-face may be an important step toward staunching terrorist recruitment .

organised by uzbekistans unicef office and the international centre for the professional development of journalists ,  the event was intended to demonstrate the right of children to express their opinion through childrens media . 
the young correspondents learned the basics of the convention on the rights of the child ,  were exposed to different genres of journalism ,  useful information sources and writing articles in an ethical manner . 
a press conference gave them an opportunity to questions stars of the uzbek stage . 
more than <num>30</num>  childrens newspapers and journals are currently published in uzbekistan ,  and childrens programmes are regularly aired on radio and television . 
most are written and presented by unpaid young journalists aged between seven and <num>16</num>  .
i learnt a lot about childrens rights ,  how to write newspaper articles and how to behave at press conferences and interviews ,  said <num>12</num> -year-old bekhzot otakhanov from urgench . 
young journalist zhenya kolesnikova hopes her articles will be more interesting to readers in future . 
unicef representative nigina baikabulova said the seminar had been planned for two years ,  and involved training teachers on childrens rights . 
during the next school holidays ,  we plan to run a similar seminar for young radio journalists ,  and then another for children working in television ,  she said . 
turkmenistans workers to become athletes by decree
turkmenistan - with the ringing in of <num>2010</num>  , turkmenistans citizens will adopt a healthy lifestyle ,  and thats an order . 
until now ,  dance has been the most popular employee activity pursued in turkmenistan . 
virtually every significant organisation and business has its own dance club . 
while these are amateur groups ,  they operate as if they were professional organisations . 
club member employees dance every day as part of their job ,  approaching the ballet bar as if it were a place on an assembly line . 
the comparison is fully justified ,  considering that dance practise take place during working hours ,  and that the dancers are salaried employees . 
the dance groups perform at government receptions and holiday celebrations . 
competitions are set to begin the first days of january . 
these will be olympic-style ,  with finals in the spring . 
turkmenistan is on its way to becoming a fit and sporting nation . 
pakistani army gains in offensive
sararogha ,  pakistan - a school the army says churned out suicide bombers now lies in ruins . 
soldiers patrol towns once ruled by militants who gave refuge to al-qaeda . 
bundles of terror manuals ,  extremist propaganda and boxes of ammunition and explosives were left behind . 
the army ferried reporters by helicopter to parts of south waziristan on <abbr>nov.</abbr>

dushanbe - the head of the national water service in the pyanj district of khatlon ,  rakhmatullo dustmatov ,  was arrested in kurgan-tyube in tajikistan on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
according to the khatlon regional administration ,  significant funds are allocated from the national budget each year to the reclamation and improvement of the area's land . 
in <num>2009</num>  , for example ,  approximately us$1 , 000 , 000 was earmarked for this purpose . 
year after year ,  however ,  farm land and pasture in a number of khatlon districts was left fallow due to poor irrigation . 
the regional government therefore requested that the state financial control and anti-corruption agency investigate the activities of enterprises in the ministry of water resources management's network . 
experts consider it evidence of the high level of corruption in the country at all levels and in a range of different organisations . 
at the same time ,  his arrest indicates that violations of the law do not go unnoticed . 
members of the banned hizb ut-tahrir organisation arrested in tashkent
in this file photo ,  investigators and policemen work at the blast site at the uzbekistans prosecutor generals office in tashkent ,  july <num>30</num>  , <num>2004</num>  .
 ( afp / getty images ) 
a criminal case has been opened on the activity of hizb ut-tahrir supporters ,  under article <num>244.2</num>  of uzbekistans criminal code  ( participation in banned religious and extremist organisations )  . 
these arrests constitute just one of many episodes in the uzbek governments struggle against those who they call religious extremists . 
as recently as july <num>28</num>  , in the southern town of denau ,  four women were convicted of being activists in hizb ut-tahrir ,  and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to five years . 
according to the court sentence ,  these women were working to recruit new members for hizb ut-tahrir ,  and also disseminating banned literature and pamphlets . 
hizb ut-tahrir  ( the islamic liberation party )  was founded in <num>1953</num>  in jerusalem by taqiuddin an-nabhani ,  a local sharia appellate court jurist ,  as a branch of the egyptian muslim brotherhood . 
following the death of an-nabhani in <num>1977</num>  , the organisation was led by the palestinian abdul qadim zallum . 
since <num>2003</num>  it has been led by ata abu rashta . 
the aim of the group is to restore the righteous islamic way of life and establish an islamic state that embodies the islamic system . 
since <num>1995</num>  the organisation has been operating in uzbekistan . 
the group is also known to be active in tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  azerbaijan ,  ukraine ,  belorussia ,  and russia . 
in the states of central asia and russia hizb ut-tahrir is considered to be a terrorist organisation and has been banned . 
at the same time ,  up to now neither the united states nor most of the european states have added hizb ut-tahrir to their lists of organisations supporting terrorism . 
tajikistan denies siphoning electricity from grid
if tajikistan continues to behave with such flagrant disregard for procedure ,  then we will have no recourse but to pull out of the system . 
otherwise ,  we risk compromising the energy security of not just our south ,  but of our entire nation ,  bozumbayev stressed . 
 " this year ,  tajikistan has an energy surplus .  " 
sangtudin produces around <num>2.7</num>  billion kilowatt-hours of the country's total output of <num>16</num>  billion kilowatt-hours . 
considering that tajikistan routinely runs electricity deficits of around <num>4</num>  billion kilowatt-hours each year ,  the country can hardly afford any shutdowns of the hydropower station .

satybaldiyev also disclosed that his department is still seeking the extradition of the ex-presidents eldest son ,  aydar akayev ,  once the son-in-law of kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . 
the prosecutor-general claims that bishkek has submitted three extradition requests to moscow ,  all of which have been turned down .

turkmenistans fuel and energy market remains attractive to foreign investors in companies from all over the world interested in investing in this sector of the countrys economy . 
the governments plan for developing the natural gas industry calls for output to reach <num>250</num>  billion cubic metres a year by <num>2030</num>  .
the expo included a business conference ,  entitled developing the oil and gas industry in turkmenistan through international cooperation ,  along with a seminar ,  doing business in the oil and gas industry in turkmenistan :  legal and taxation issues . 
the yearly exposition has developed fruitful business contacts and identified new investors and partners for turkmenistan . 
just this year ,  itera and rwe partnered with the country to develop the turkmen shelf of the caspian sea . 
the petroleum company chevron has similar aspirations in this region ,  hoping to develop deep-sea petrol reserves jointly with turkmenistan through use of the company's innovative technology .

workers were obliged to give up a months wages in <num>1993</num>  and <num>1994</num>  so that the plant could be built . 
there are currently approximately <num>2.1</num>  million employees in tajikistan ,  with an average monthly income of us$70 . 
ubaydulloyev estimates that if all workers paid one months wages into the rogun hydroelectric plant fund ,  <num>154</num>  $  million could be raised ,  which would double the pace of construction .

tajikistan - two german experts on ecology and uranium tailings disposal concluded that it will cost more than us$22 million to bury exposed uranium tailings and revamp existing tailings dumps outside the town of taboshar in northern tajikistan .

recently ,  in the provincial capital mazar-e sharif ,  a man carrying weapons and attempting to enter the city centre on a motorcycle ,  was recently arrested by balkh province police thanks to a tip off from local people . 
according to shirjan durrani ,  a police spokesperson in mazar-e sharif ,  the criminal was carrying six russian kalashnikovs . 
travelling from chaharbolak district ,  the armed motorcyclist was trying to enter mazar-e sharif by its western gate . 
durrani said ,  the criminal was carrying weapons for insurgents . 
most of these weapons were planned to be used against innocent people . 
people are sick of these crimes and are informing police when they hear about and see suspicious behaviour . 
if people help the police ,  we will no longer face any security or criminal problems . 
but at times people ,  especially those living in rural areas ,  fear they may be named if they report a crime to the police . 
criminal groups have caused many problems in the past and many people continue to fear them . 
but as the police grow stronger ,  hopefully this fear will subside ,  said joma . 
karachi - mangal bagh and his tehrik-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  supporters are cruel killers and extortionists who have no respect for women ,  said eye-witnesses to the atrocities he and his ttp supporters committed in khyber agency last year . 
recalling the horrible scene ,  he said bagh and his ttp accomplices suddenly appeared in the bazaar of the village ,  and ransacked cds and barber shops . 
they got hold of a woman who came alone to market ,  and slaughtered her in the presence of many people ,  he said somberly . 
they then announced that they would mete out the same punishment to any woman who dared to come to the market unescorted . 
eventually ,  however ,  taliban atrocities united the people ,  who organized a militia and fought baghs gang ,  killed some of them ,  and forced them out of the village ,  akbar said . 
while bagh has not returned to afridi ,  he continued to send threatening messages to the village . 
state bank of pakistan announces discount rate cut
karachi - the industrial sector in pakistan has paid us$1 . 1 billion in loans to domestic banks in the last seven months ,  demonstrating a sharp turnaround in the sector ,  the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  revealed in its monetary policy ,  announced on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
<num>24</num>  .
the monetary policy statement points out that industries paid off <num>36.1</num>  $  million in loans to banks in <num>19</num>  weeks of the <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  financial year  ( fy )  ,  but in the last seven months ,  the industrial sector paid off more than <num>1.1</num>  $  billion in loans . 
borrowing from banks might have become unaffordable for some industries ,  businessmen and ordinary borrowers ,  had the discount rate not been cut . 
pakistans industry could witness a major boom if borrowing becomes less expensive ,  sheikh said . 
the sbp decision to reduce the discount rate by only half a percent is not enough to support industry efforts to combat recession and accelerate recovery rapidly ,  said lahore chamber of commerce and industry president zafar iqbal chaudhry on nov <num>25</num>  .
there is a need for the sbp to make further cuts if it wants to see an improved economy based on enhanced industrial productivity ,  he argued . 
tajikistan increases number of small hydroelectric power stations
the ministry of energy states that there are plans to commission an additional ten small hydroelectric power stations before the end of the year ,  which will bring the current number of such stations in the country to <num>193</num>  .
in the first half of <num>2009</num>  , they produced approximately <num>60</num>  million of the <num>18</num>  billion kwh of electricity produced annually in tajikistan . 
deputy head of state energy company barki tocheks central control service sergei tkachenko said that given the power-generating potential of mountain rivers ,  the construction of small hydroelectric power stations will continue . 
they are particularly efficient in mountain villages ,  where there are problems connecting consumers to the centralised electricity supply system . 
furthermore ,  the commissioning of new hydroelectric power stations reduces the volume of electricity shortages the country suffers in the autumn and winter . 
in future ,  they will all be integrated into the countrys single energy system . 
among those who have expressed interest in investing in tajikistans construction of small and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations are russia ,  ukraine ,  iran and the european bank for reconstruction and development . 
ukrainian investors are planning to set up a joint venture in tajikistan to produce hydro equipment for small and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations . 
police to control weapons traffic in kyrgyzstan
as a result ,  the ministry has proposed amendments to the law ,  that if endorsed by parliament ,  will require owners of awarded weapons to present them for inspection every five years and renew their ownership licences every three years and they will not be entitled to sell them . 
few awarded weapons have been registered to date ,  and representatives of law enforcement agencies believe the time has come not only to make registration a requirement ,  but also to change the procedure by which weapons are awarded by the government . 
previously ,  awards of weapons were issued exclusively by the prime minister ,  but the ministry of the interior has proposed that they be granted only with the approval of the entire cabinet . 
the ministry also seeks to make registration of hunting weapons compulsory . 
there are more than <num>30,000</num>  weapons of this kind in kyrgyzstan . 
according to deputy internal affairs minister talantbek isayev ,  an order cancelling the right of legal entities to acquire <num>100</num>  firearms has already been signed . 
during an investigation ,  it was established that many private companies obtain firearms without registering them ,  isayev stated . 
a study by the institute of international studies in geneva ,  switzerland entitled ,  kyrgyzstan :  a firearms anomaly in central asia ,  reports that law enforcement authorities confiscated around <num>5,000</num>  illegal firearms in kyrgyzstan between <num>1999</num>  and <num>2003</num>  .
dushanbe - the deputy chief accountant at the state energy holding company ,  barki tochik ,  was arrested on december <num>1</num>  in dushanbe ,  suspected of misappropriating state funds on a particularly massive scale . 
according to fattokh saidov ,  the director of the state financial control and anti-corruption agency ,  kayumov and his four accomplices falsified documents and embezzled approximately us$300 , 000
the deputy chief accountants accomplices confessed and returned most of the embezzled funds to the state coffers . 
at the same time ,  kayumov denies any involvement in the crime whatsoever and regards himself as innocent ,  saidov added . 
according to the results of inspections and audits of state institutions and at state enterprises ,  members of the anti-corruption agency have ,  in the course of the first <num>9</num>  months of <num>2009</num>  , uncovered losses exceeding <num>12,000,000</num>  $  .
at the same time ,  in november <num>2009</num>  , the international organisation transparency international published its regular annual report on global corruption . 
experts calculate that in <num>2008</num>  public officials in various countries embezzled no less than <num>400</num>  $  billion . 
tajikistan ranked 158t out of <num>180</num>  in terms of its corruption rating ,  reflecting the countrys traditionally high level of corruption . 
this has an adverse effect on absolutely all spheres of tajikistan society and holds back the countrys development . 
kyrgyzstan publishes anti-drug trafficking statistics
afghan heroin confiscated en route to russia . 
kyrgyzstan - kyrgyz security agencies battling the illegal trade in drugs reported that this year they seized more than seven tonnes of drugs ,  <num>66</num>  percent of which comprised heroin and opium . 
ministry of internal affairs press office head bakyt seitov noted that the number of couriers carrying drugs in their stomachs has recently been increasing . 
dozens of human containers have been arrested this year . 
unfortunately ,  in recent years ,  kyrgyzstan has become not only the biggest supplier of hard drugs ,  but also the biggest consumer . 
according to some sources ,  more than five percent of its population uses hard drugs ,  said the director of the ngo parents against drugs ,  omur burkhanov .

because there is no centralised agency in kyrgyzstan to channel humanitarian aid in a transparent manner ,  the system of monetary compensation leads to corruption . 
gulcha village resident zhibek zhoroyeva related that her house in the village several hours from nura was seriously damaged in the same earthquake . 
the government commission ,  however ,  declared it safe and habitable . 
only after she sent a letter to the president's administration did the commission change its opinion and provide her with a loan to build a new house . 
residents of regions suffering from natural disasters propose the creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate corruption in the distribution of humanitarian and financial aid . 
victims of last springs floods and mudslides in tajikistan still homeless
the report states that people who were affected by the disaster are still living in tents ,  taking refuge in schools and spending nights at the homes of host families or relatives to shelter from the cold . 
other humanitarian organisations are building water supply networks in the new settlements and are donating funds and basic necessities to the victims . 
the funds allocated are insufficient to provide all families with everything they need ,  however . 
they cannot rely on the hospitality of families who are just as poor as they are ,  said ilya todorovich ,  the acting un coordinator in tajikistan . 
he believes the international community should offer them assistance and alleviate their increasing poverty . 
according to the un ,  more than us$7 . 7 million will be needed to help those affected by the floods and mudslides and to build earthquake-resistant settlements in tajikistan . 
so far ,  tajikistan has received <num>1.7</num>  $  million ,  or little more than <num>21</num>  percent of the total amount . 
the torrential rain that lashed the country in april and may caused widespread flooding ,  landslides and mudslides . 
the disasters claimed <num>21</num>  lives and caused damage estimated by the government at <num>100</num>  $  million .

tajikistan - samples of shares in the rogun hydroelectric power station have gone on public display in tajikistan . 
in presenting the share certificates at a cabinet meeting that broadcast on state television ,  minister of finance safarali najmuddinov announced that the shares would incorporate four levels of security features to prevent forgery . 
the share certificates will be sold through banks ,  the financial departments of the presidents executive office ,  ministries ,  departments and other government institutions ,  he said . 
they will be printed in germany ,  where the national currency also used to be printed . 
last week ,  president rahmon called on every family to buy approximately us$700 in shares . 
there is no way everyone can invest that amount in the construction ,  even if it is such a necessary facility ,  said one expert who wished to remain anonymous . 
of course ,  the money must be found by all possible means ,  but it is not very likely that people will voluntarily give up one months wages . 
in his view ,  there are many people who will be unhappy about this voluntary-compulsory initiative ,  but will be unable to admit this openly . 
those who are unhappy about it will be declared enemies of the nation ,  as the campaign is being waged under national independence slogans ,  the expert concluded .

much of the kazakh highway infrastructure ,  like this road in the steppe region ,  is sorely lacking a good foundation for heavy traffic ,  making travel difficult . 
when the western europe-western china road is built ,  transportation issues will ease .

help wanted :  construction workers ,  road bridge construction workers ,  highway construction workers . 
in kazakhstan . 
thousands of jobs will be one of the immediate benefits when construction of the western europe-western china highway project begins in <num>2010</num>  .
the three-year project to build the <num>3,000</num> -km road from china across kazakhstan to russia ,  and on to western europe ,  is the world banks most expensive project to date . 
jobs aside ,  the project is not without its detractors ,  primarily because of anticipated environmental and social costs . 
environmentalists are concerned that the road will disturb many forms of fauna that are listed in the red book . 
argali are a wild mountain sheep that live in the highlands of central asia that are listed in the red book of endangered species . 
problems of an environmental character bother local officials less than they do the farmers . 
for government officials the road is the priority ,  beisova said . 
projected employment for the three-year project is estimated to range from <num>35,000</num>  to <num>50,000</num>  people . 
moto konishi ,  head of world banks central asian office ,  told the newspaper panorama it would be <num>35,000</num>  ;  kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev announced last may it could be <num>50,000</num>  .
plans call for the highway to be built primarily along existing roads in southern kazakhstan and the aktobe oblast in the northwest . 
it will start at khorgos ,  go through almaty and shymkent ,  then up to the western border with the russian federation . 
still ,  it will mark a new era in the country because kazakhstan lacks major developed highways . 
the countrys current transportation infrastructure is collapsing in many areas outside of major cities . 
the corridor will become the most economically viable and convenient for continental transit from china to europe ,  according to eunkyung kwon ,  principal transport specialist from the asian development bank  ( adb )  headquarters in manila . 
nazarbayev has defined the project as a peoples project reminiscent of the gigantic projects of the soviet era . 
according to beisova ,  one main problem is a lack of transparency about the project . 
she said there is the issue of a lack of understanding on the part of regional bureaucrats involved in the project ,  and their secretiveness and unwillingness to share information about the project . 
beisova raised her concerns in the publication respublika ,  and the adb sent a delegation to kazakh communities to discuss local concerns . 
in some regional districts covered by the project ,  the cooperative and participatory model of project implementation works well thanks to the local authorities and the active involvement on the part of international financial institutions ,  karaban said . 
she cited temirlanovka village in south kazakhstan as one example . 
the public hearings on the project brought positive results because of the participation of the local population ,  karaban said . 
after a public hearing ,  the project route was shifted to mitigate the negative effects of the project on the community . 
karaban said this was convenient for both the local population and the project planners ,  since it decreased the number of houses earmarked for demolition . 
ngo leader criticizes world bank environmental project in eastern kazakhstan
the irtysh river passes through ust-kamenogorsk ,  one of the most contaminated cities in kazakhstan because of heavy-metal processing facilities . 
 [ getty images ] 
ust-kamenogorsk ,  kazakhstan - calling the project outdated ,  a leader of a local ngo has criticized the world banks  ( wb )  us <num>40</num>  $  million environmental remediation project for groundwater clean-up . 
the whole situation changed drastically during the last seven to <num>10</num>  years ,  oleg chernyshov ,  head of the ngo institute of analysis and forecast ,  told central asia online . 
the project is aimed at the prevention of groundwater contaminated by industrial waste sites to reach sensitive resources including residential areas in the city ,  drinking water wells ,  and the irtysh river ,  according to the world banks web site . 
to achieve this objective ,  the project will invest in the containment of the concerned industrial waste sites ,  prevention of further migration of polluted groundwater ,  and strengthening of local institutions to monitoring this type of pollution . 
the majority of the former polluters ,  chernyshov says ,  already have a zero pollution production cycle ,  which means that the quantity of contaminated ground waters should be less than it was <num>10</num>  years ago . 
wb project representative bakyt arystanov says that argument supports the project ,  which he says was designed in <num>2005</num> -<num>06</num>  .
so things may have changed in the last three to four years . 
this is exactly the reason why the first phase of project implementation is a site investigation and design stage to investigate the current status of groundwater pollution and the contributing industrial waste dumps ,  arystanov said . 
if certain objects are already remediated ,  they obviously will not be included in the project implementation scope . 
these investigations are in progress . 
the fact that remediation works already have been undertaken in recent years has also been made by local authorities and this is a point of close attention ,  he said . 
as it appears at this moment ,  four of the seven industrial waste dumps did not undergo substantial changes in recent years . 
the picture is still mixed for the other three dump sites where the situation has changed . 
one of these three needs further remediation work ,  one is under further investigation and the third one seems to be adequately remediated . 
investigations will be fully completed in the coming months ,  arystanov said . 
the irtysh river is one of biggest rivers in kazakhstan . 
the upper stream of the river is in china and after passing through the east of kazakhstan it flows into russia . 
ust-kamenogorsk is one of the most contaminated cities in the country ,  home to zinc ,  titanium ,  tantalum ,  uranium and other heavy-metals processing facilities . 
the european union also supports the program and is providing a separate grant of euro <num>3.5</num>  million for groundwater quality monitoring and institutional strengthening . 
the project is expected to be completed in march <num>2013</num>  .
chernyshov also expressed concerns over the lack of participation of the local ngos in the project monitoring process . 
we have some questions for the world bank ,  he said since the project information is closed for the general public . 
he claims the local ngo group sent a number of inquiries about the project to the wb office in astana ,  but that no clear answers were provided . 
chernyshov said the representative of the project group came to ust-kamenogorsk on a monitoring mission ,  but a meeting with local ngos did not provide a participatory opportunity for the local civic activists to get involved in the monitoring process . 
arystanov said ,  the scope of activities funded from the eu grant is mainly in supporting local monitoring and leak detection capabilities . 
if the design stage would conclude that two of the seven dumps may not need or only partially need the intended remediation scope ,  this would unlikely be a considerable reduction of the total project scope and not be directly related to the activities for which eu grant funding is utilized ,  he said
arystanov promised that the project will involve civil society in the monitoring process . 
world bank is confident that the committee for water resources with support from ngos or  ( a )  coalition of ngos and the bank can build a constructive and positive environment for project implementation and monitoring ,  he said . 
kazakhstan to borrow us <num>1</num>  $  billion from world bank
kazakhstan will borrow us <num>1</num>  $  billion in <num>2010</num>  from the bank to cover a budget deficit ,  but some say the loan is not needed . 
 [ photo by win mcnamee / getty images ] 
astana ,  kazakhstan -the idea that kazakhstan will borrow us <num>1</num>  $  billion from the world bank  ( wb )  has drawn a variety of responses from economists . 
minister of economy and budget planning bakhyt sultanov announced the loan december <num>31</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , and said ,  the money could cover part of the budget deficit in <num>2010</num>  and delay the issue of foreign currency bonds . 
government estimates put kazakhstans budget deficit at us <num>4.9</num>  $  billion ,  or <num>4.1</num>  percent of the gross domestic product . 
john litwack ,  lead wb economist for kazakhstan said the bank was working on a possible development policy loan of as much as us <num>1</num>  $  billion . 
this loan would help kazakhstan finance the expected budget deficit in <num>2010</num>  in support of the governments economic program ,  he said . 
but leading kazakh economist olzhas khudaibergenov doubts the loan is needed . 
for the country ,  which has us $ <num>45</num>  billion in its national fund ,  there is no need to borrow us <num>13</num>  $  billion from china ,  nor us $ <num>1</num>  billion from the wb . 
moreover ,  giving the money with one hand and asking for it with the other is completely impossible to understand from the point of view of a sober economic mind ,  he said . 
there is no logic in issuing bonds in foreign currency because the budget deficit - where the borrowed money will be channelled - is shaped by spending in tenge  ( kazakh currency )  . 
speaking in general ,  during the last two years ,  the government took a range of actions that are incompatible with the circumstances in the country and its needs ,  he said . 
but zhanibek khassan ,  a policy adviser of the public finance transparency program of the soros-foundation kazakhstan said ,  in countries with growing and transitional economies ,  an evolving democratic government should have access to additional funds from international institutions . 
at the same time ,  it is critical that these loans and their uses are transparent ,  and the government accounts for them not only to the lender ,  but also to the society in general as ,  ultimately ,  it is the wider society that will be paying part of this loan back through its taxes . 
he says the loan could be justified . 
actually ,  the wb loan could be interesting for the government from the point of view of diversification of borrowings ,  interest rates ,  loan management and credit servicing . 
in this situation ,  it is a good opportunity to receive cheap money for a long term . 
the main thing is that the funding will be distributed or spent transparently ,  responsibly and with accountability . 
magbat spanov ,  an independent economist from almaty said ,  this once again shows that the government did not make any conclusions on the results of financial allocations during the last year . 
if this loan will be financing some infrastructural development programs then it could be actually taken ,  but if it will be directed to the current balance of payments support or social security payments then this will not be in accordance with the national interests of the country . 
officials say kyrgyz sugar prices will remain stable despite global shortage
a global shortage of sugar is creating problems in kyrgyzstan ,  which used to be an exporter of the commodity . 
now ,  kyrgyz residents are wondering if they will be able to afford it and if it will be available . 
bishkek ,  kyrgyzstan - kyrgyz officials are vowing to keep domestic sugar prices stable ,  even as a global shortage tightens its grip and domestic production falls . 
the international sugar organisation is forecasting a global sugar crisis in the first half of <num>2010</num>  as demand outstrips supply ,  but kyrgyz officials are issuing reassurances in the face of such announcements . 
at a december <num>28</num>  press conference ,  the director of the state agency for antimonopoly policy nadyrbek turganbaev said the price of sugar in kyrgyzstan will decrease in <num>2010</num>  .
over the past year ,  white refined sugar has risen in price to us$734 . 50 from about us$400 per tonne . 
experts predict the world sugar deficit could grow to <num>9</num>  meter  tonnes in <num>2010</num>  .
turganbaev said that in ukraine and belarus - two of kyrgyzstans key sugar suppliers - the price of electricity has not risen ,  keeping sugar prices low . 
that ,  combined with domestic sugar production ,  he said ,  will buffer sugar prices . 
in kyrgyzstan ,  sugar is one of the nine essential food items . 
the ministry of agriculture ,  water resources and processing industry controls the sugar supply and the antimonopoly agency controls its price . 
according to the national statistical committee ,  kyrgyzstan has four sugar production plants ,  but only one ,  jsc kaindy-kant ,  is operating . 
all four were built under soviet rule . 
after the collapse of the  [ soviet ]  union ,  the sugar industry gradually slowed down ,  said alexandr barbalat ,  director of the jsc aprosakh plant . 
in terms of sugar production ,  the very hardest  [ times ]  were the last three years . 
barbalat said farmers have moved on to more profitable agricultural crops because of unfavourable terms offered by kaindy-kant . 
according to the owners of the farmstead vetka ,  the former management of kaidy-kants sugar factory said beet roots clogged up the equipment without turning out any sugar . 
therefore ,  farmsteads were forced to turn beets into fodder . 
the statistical committee said no sugar was produced last year in kyrgyzstan . 
in <num>2008</num>  , the country produced <num>10,700</num>  tonnes . 
from <num>2006</num>  to <num>2008</num>  , sugar production fell by <num>81.3</num>  percent . 
barbalat called that inexcusably low . 
according to statistical data ,  the price of sugar in kyrgyzstan increased by <num>16.8</num>  percent since december <num>2009</num>  , even though turganbaev predicted stable sugar prices . 
barbalat cites different figures ,  saying the price of sugar imported from belarus has risen approximately <num>20</num>  percent over the past two months . 
currently ,  the sugar market is feverish ,  barbalat said . 
the prices are jumping and domestic sugar companies are idle ,  and in such an unstable situation it is very difficult to make any forecasts . 
alymkan mansurova ,  head of the department of the development of quality and food security ,  said kyrgyzstan is in a precarious position because it cannot produce enough sugar . 
the government set quotas on sugar imports ,  and is enforcing them for the kaindy-kant ,  koshoi and coca-cola factories . 
if there were no quota ,  the factories would go bankrupt and the time when we supplied all of central asia would become only part of the past . 
kyrgyzstan would never be able to reclaim the former glory of  [ being a ]  sugar republic ,  said barbalat . 
we have reached a critical point ,  and without state support we will not be able to revive the industry . 
makhsatbek ,  a chui oblast farmer ,  said that several years ago he grew sugar beets ,  but for various reasons -- like allegedly excessive dirt and inadequate sugar content -- factory managers reduced what they paid him . 
growing the crop became unprofitable . 
he is waiting to see how the factories will work with the farmers next season . 
it takes years to restore confidence . 
but now the government ,  manufacturers and farmers are united in a common interest . 
this gives hope that the situation will improve for the better ,  said barbalat . 
kazmunaigas strike enters 3rd week in spite of police pressure
a mangistau department of internal affairs official confirmed to central asia online that police were gathering in aktau and preparing to travel to zhanoazen . 
authorities are reportedly seeking to arrest strike leaders for conducting an unlawful walkout . 
a court earlier ruled the strike illegal . 
kazmunaigas support workers went on strike march <num>1</num>  to protest a new pay plan they say will reduce their wages . 
they are demanding a return to the previous salary and production bonus plan and removal of company management as well as of the leaders of their own trade union . 
the strike began with <num>1,500</num>  to <num>3,000</num>  oil workers stopping work for one hour ,  but by the fourth day they did not come to work at all . 
as of last week observers estimated that some <num>10,000</num>  workers had gone on strike . 
news reports on march <num>15</num>  say production in the western kazakh oil field has plummeted by about <num>800</num>  tonnes per day ,  with some <num>422</num>  production wells shut down and <num>743</num>  operating at reduced output . 
they want to deprive us of the territorial coefficient ,  but this should not be done ,  said roza tuletayeva ,  a striker who works at petroleum and gas extracting administration <num>-3</num>  .
we are in a hazardous industry and a bad environment… <num>90</num>  %  of the employees are anaemic . 
there are disabled people among us . 
some are asserting a need for the state to again have stakes in private companies and take control over the distribution of profits and tendering . 
the strikers are seeking negotiations directly with the government ,  underscoring their distrust in both company management and their own labour union . 
company leaders ,  meanwhile ,  are pinning blame for the workers complaints on the labour leaders . 
when  ( work )  plans went unfulfilled ,  the bonuses were reduced . 
under such a system ,  we are guaranteeing that the oil workers average annual income will not decrease but ,  on the contrary ,  will increase <num>1</num> -<num>3</num>  %  ,  he said . 
the oil workers salaries are some of the highest in the country . 
this is not the first dispute between oil workers and kazmunaigas . 
last year ,  labour turned to the courts ,  claiming non-payment of salaries between october <num>2008</num>  and february <num>2009</num>  .
the prosecutors office found the company was <num>130</num>  meter  kzt  ( us <num>884,000</num>  $  )  in arrears on salaries . 
there have been other disputes with the company as well . 
the companys implementation of the new pay plan has also frustrated workers . 
rather than conduct a general meeting to explain the plan and have workers sign the necessary documents ,  it has been calling in oil workers one-by-one to sign the agreement modifying their pay . 
the document also reportedly contains a clause about termination of employment in cases of insubordination . 
both sides are right and wrong ,  said aleksandr mukha ,  aktau branch director of the international bureau for human rights and rule of law . 
one side did not want ,  or could not inform each worker on its large payroll ,  which provoked confusion and discontent . 
the other began to protest without waiting for an explanation . 
management needs to sit down at the negotiating table with the strike committee . 
the  ( two )  sides reached <abbr>…</abbr>  agreement after long and difficult negotiations ,  according to a march <num>19</num>  press release by the oil company . 
independent labour leader mukhtar umbetov confirmed the end of the strike to central asia online . 
the strikers had demanded the ouster of their official trade union leaders and of their company ceo ,  as well as the elimination of a new payment system that they feared would cut their pay . 
on march <num>16</num>  , ozenmunaigaz director baqytqali biseken was fired . 
officials also promised not to sell the company to china and to meet workers demands on the pay system . 
some strikers complained of intimidation by committee for national security agents ,  according to rfe / rls kazakh service . 
all striking workers were scheduled to return to work march <num>19</num>  .
the latest round of labour unrest in zhanaozen began on march <num>1</num>  and became a mass strike on march <num>4</num>  .
1st dating agency opens in tajikistan
the countrys first dating agency seeks to help lonely hearts in tajikistan find partners . 
khujand ,  tajikistan - the countrys first dating agency ,  yusuf  & amp ;  zulaikho ,  has opened in khujand ,  sogd oblast ,  of tajikistan ,  promising to change singles lives for the better . 
the agency provides information services to anyone ,  regardless of his or her age ,  who wishes to find a friend or someone to live with as a family ,  company director murod kurbanov said . 
he opened the agency to help people who are widowed ,  divorced or seeking to marry for the first time ,  kurbanov said . 
madina akhmedova ,  <num>30</num>  , of khujand ,  divorced her husband five years ago . 
her ex-spouse left her alone to bring up her two sons and pay for their education . 
she works in a printing company earning tjs150  ( us$34 )  per month -- hardly enough to make ends meet . 
i used to think i would <abbr>…</abbr>  never get married again ,  akhmedova said . 
but now i understand it is very difficult to be alone ,  and my sons need a father . 
according to the sogd oblast statistics committee ,  authorities registered <num>2,767</num>  divorces in the region in <num>2009</num>  , up by <num>95</num>   ( or <num>3</num>  %  )  from <num>2008</num>  .
the regional committee for womens and family affairs welcomed the dating agency opening . 
many nice girls sit at home ,  unable to get married for different reasons . 
the dating agency gives them a chance - although we should make sure it works efficiently ,  according to the committee . 
akhmedova said she would like to get acquainted with a man ,  but i dont know where . 
discos are deemed to be dens of iniquity ,  so meeting a prospective husband there is out of the question . 
here ,  its not even acceptable for a single woman to go to a restaurant by herself . 
this is taken as a sign that she is a woman of easy virtue ,  she said . 
the khujand-based weekly magazine programma televideniya experimented with personal ads five years ago . 
it served mostly men ,  editor bakhriniso abdurakhmanova said . 
we had to shut down the personals six months later ,  she said . 
the current procedure is different ,  with ethical norms duly observed ,  kurbanov said . 
applicants fill out questionnaires ,  and we help them find a partner for an affordable fee . 
over the  ( several )  weeks we have operated ,  we have had about <num>40</num>  men and women come to us . 
clearly ,  people need our services . 
we receive men and women separately ,  he said . 
i decided to go there because they guarantee confidentiality ,  akhmedova said . 
this is a chance to change my life for the better . 
samadova is not sure there will be many clients . 
it is a new kind of business that will be treated by tajik women with apprehension ,  considering their traditional mentality . 
only those having no other way out may be expected to turn  ( there )  for help . 
meanwhile ,  the dating agency is hoping to open a branch in dushanbe . 
the package of documents is ready ,  and an authorised representative will go to the capital soon to hold relevant negotiations . 
china's tbea to build heating / power plant in dushanbe
dushanbes combined heating and power plant is one of two in tajikistan . 
tebian electric apparatus of china plans to build a new heating / power plant in dushanbe ,  but environmentalists worry about its potential impact . 
 [ jamila sujud ] 
dushanbe -- a chinese-built combined heating and electrical power plant is rising on the outskirts of dushanbe ,  but environmentalists worry the ecological cost could outweigh the energy benefits it provides . 
the government is promoting the energy that the coal-fired plant will produce and the advanced technology in its construction . 
the plant is important ,  since dushanbe has suffered electrical deficits in recent winters ,  said abbos norov ,  deputy chief of the ministry of economic development and trade foreign investment department . 
we need to be less dependent ,  above all ,  on imported energy ,  said shuhrat rahmatboyev ,  deputy chairman of the state committee on investment and administration of property . 
he said uzbekistans withdrawal from the regional energy grid put tajikistan in a difficult situation . 
the lessons learned in building a coal-fired heating / power plant for the first time will be useful elsewhere in the country ,  norov said . 
the technology that will be used in the plants construction will meet modern environmental standards . 
the tajik government said the plant complies with the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer ,  the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and several other treaties . 
centre for research and utilisation of renewable energy sources head kurbonjon kabutov is worried that nobody conducted an environmental assessment before construction began . 
tajikistan ,  with its huge coal reserves ,  does not have the right to not use these resources ,  said kabutov . 
but it should be noted that there will be harm from it . 
if new technology is used to build it ,  we can hope that the environmental impact will not be too great . 
while chinese engineers have mastered western technology ,  he said ,  he questions whether they will use it in tajikistan . 
tbea has built several such facilities in china and elsewhere ,  and they are operating successfully ,  norov said . 
tbea declined to comment ,  but the companys russian-language website said ,  tbea pays attention to environmental protection <abbr>…</abbr>  and insists on the principle of minimal harm to the environment . 
that contradicts the aarhus convention ,  which says every citizen has the right to environmental information ,  muzafarov said . 
latifi said the only person with that information is khursandmurod zikirov ,  chairman of the state committee for environmental protection and forestry . 
zikirov refused to be interviewed for this story . 
modern technology is so developed that it will allow for the coal to be burnt to the maximum and it will be possible to reuse the coal waste for producing building materials and fertilisers ,  rahmatboyev said . 
the plant will be operating with a three-dimensional filtration system ,  which reduces the threat of environmental pollution ,  said vafo niyatbekov ,  a scholar at the presidential centre for strategic research . 
some worry about the geographic handicaps of the capital . 
 ( the )  construction of the heating / power plant at the entrance to the city <abbr>…</abbr>  is undesirable since the dust will be sent into town ,  agreed an ecologist who spoke on the condition of anonymity . 
the management of the committee on environmental protection signs off on certificates of appraisal without discussing them with environmentalists ,  the anonymous ecologist said . 
that the chinese side is acting secretly <abbr>…</abbr>  shows it has something to hide . 
a coal-burning plant violates the kyoto protocol  ( which tajikistan signed )  by increasing co2 emissions ,  the ecologist added . 
some with memories of heat and power outages in the winter welcome the plant . 
mavlyuda ,  a housewife with several children ,  called the construction of such a plant timely . 
tajikistan produces most of its electricity with hydroelectric plants - <num>16.1</num>  out of every <num>16.43</num>  kwh - and heating / power plants ,  according to the centre for research and utilisation of renewable energy sources . 
the primary energy sources are hydro  ( <num>76</num>  %  )  ,  gas  ( <num>14</num>  %  )  ,  oil  ( <num>9</num>  %  )  and coal  ( <num>1</num>  %  )  . 
tajik pilots go abroad in search of better life
a tajik air pilot prepares to take off . 
he is one of a lucky few who learned how to fly a boeing . 
 [ nazim kalandarov ] 
dadojon madaminov ,  a former flight instructor at khudzhand airport certified for the russian-made an-24 and an-26 ,  said he lost his job in tajikistan and left in search of happiness abroad in <num>1993</num>  .
tajikistans russian-made aircraft gradually stopped being used ,  madaminov said . 
so those pilots who trained to fly these aircraft were left without work . 
madaminov now works in iran . 
his pay in africa and the middle east is several times higher than in tajikistan ,  he said . 
pilots received about us <num>300</num>  $  a month before they started leaving the country ,  according to state airline tajik air . 
khudzhand airport has two an-24s ,  but has eight captains ,  <num>16</num>  second pilots ,  eight navigators and ten flight engineers in reserve for its an-24 and an-26 fleet ,  said victor zagoruiko ,  commander of the tajik air fleet at the airport . 
the other an-24s and an-26s are out of commission ,  and wreckers have scrapped the <num>11</num>  tu-134s the airport once had . 
the airport has three tu-154s ,  but management refuses to use them because they burn too much fuel . 
our airport may soon become just a transit point ,  and the airport itself will not have its own air fleet . 
in five years ,  the remaining an-24s will also be written off ,  said the manager . 
most pilots learned to fly on russian planes and cannot operate modern aircraft ,  zagoruiko said . 
russia has trained tajikistans pilots since soviet times ,  and the latter does not have its own school . 
but boeing training is limited only to those who know enough english to absorb it . 
those who could not be retrained go abroad ,  zagoruiko said . 
they were glad to take our pilots there because they have extensive flight experience ,  including in mountainous conditions ,  zagoruiko said . 
but tajik pilots often have to fly in difficult conditions abroad and it is not unusual for them to crash ,  the father of one tajik air pilot said . 
such was the case may <num>17</num>  in afghanistan ,  when a pamir airways an-24 crashed . 
the all-tajik crew was killed . 
zeromax scandal raises questions about ownership
uzgazoil  ( a subsidiary of zeromax )  stations are still operating even after the reported bankruptcy of zeromax . 
 [ talib kurbanov ] 
tashkent - zeromax ,  a swiss-based conglomerate ,  continues to operate in uzbekistan in the face of a half-billion-dollar debt to the government and a court order to seize its assets . 
but the companys future remains as mysterious and disputed as its ownership . 
zeromax created controversy when critics alleged it was enriching gulnara karimova ,  president islam karimovs daughter . 
it listed its <num>2008</num>  operating income as <num>3.298</num>  billion swiss francs  ( us <num>2.848</num>  $  billion )  . 
now ,  it has been plunged into scandal and court proceedings . 
the firms troubles began may <num>5</num>  when an uzbek court ordered its assets seized and a halt to its operations to satisfy nearly a half-billion-dollar debt to the uzbek government . 
uzbek political scientist tashbulat yuldashev identified the debt as unpaid taxes on oil and gas export revenues that the company was supposed to pay starting in <num>2006</num>  after a five-year tax holiday . 
unconfirmed reports may <num>21</num>  said that uzbekneftegaz and russias lukoil bought <num>51</num>  %  and <num>49</num>  %  ,  respectively ,  of the firm . 
but an anonymous uzbek journalist disputed claims of lukoils participation . 
in uzbekistan ,  the company shows signs of disarray . 
police questioned zeromax executive director mirodil jalalov in may ,  holding him for some time ,  economist and former uzbek diplomat alisher taksanov told central asia online . 
a source with numerous zeromax contacts in karshy ,  where zeromax has a number of projects ,  said jalalov was questioned before being released . 
he might as well return to the company ,  the observer added . 
most of the companys employees are on unpaid furlough ,  but will return in late july ,  the karshy source said . 
most of the employees and some of the management will be back ,  the source added . 
even uzbek football might have been affected . 
star brazilian coach luis felipe scolari resigned early from the zeromax-backed football team ,  fc bunyodkor of tashkent ,  citing team financial problems . 
were all in shock because the club is completely broke ,  a bunyodkor employee recently told central asia online . 
the uzbek prosecutors office has refused to comment on the zeromax case . 
karimova has denied reports that she fully or partly owned zeromax . 
karimova never owned the company ,  a zeromax employee in switzerland told central asia online ,  saying jalalov owned the firm . 
the swiss commercial register has never listed karimova as a company partner or officer . 
the swiss register previously listed zeromax holdings ag and american businessman harry eustace as part-owners . 
the world bank and adb both told central asia online they had no financial involvement with zeromax . 
some observers have wondered whether zeromaxs problems mean that karimova is losing her chance to succeed her father ,  with some predicting the ascendancy of prime minister shavkat mirziyaev . 
another school of thought holds that the companys troubles do not affect karimova ,  the uzbek ambassador to spain . 
karimova and her father both seem ,  at least publicly ,  unaffected by zeromaxs problems . 
karimova went to the cannes film festival may <num>21</num>  , while karimov may <num>26</num>  toured the andijan region - site of the may <num>13</num>  , <num>2005</num>  , massacre of demonstrators . 
in june he hosted summits of the adb and the shanghai co-operation organisation in tashkent . 
karimova might not object to zeromaxs disappearance or even want to be president of uzbekistan ,  observers suggested to central asia online . 
he knows she doesnt have the administrative experience  ( to be president )  . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  she has everything she wants ,  taksanov said . 
agreeing with taksanov is a former assistant of karimovas who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
zeromax accomplished its mission . 
it laundered the money ,  shipped it to offshore accounts . 
gulnara didnt need this ;  she needs to look clean for european society . 
… zeromax was attracting jealousy . 
so it gets jettisoned like a snake shedding an old skin .

the festival was made possible with support from the french embassy in kyrgyzstan ,  local authorities and several international ngos accredited to work in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan . 
according to ripart ,  the festival aims not only to preserve the wide variety or kyrgyz horse breeds ,  but also to revive lost traditions ,  games and customs of the country's nomadic past . 
opening the kyrgyz aty festival in alay . 
 ( photo by aleksey osokina ) 
first held in <num>2005</num>  , the kyrgyz aty festival takes place in regions where old traditions of horse-breeding have been maintained . 
the festival includes horse racing and kyrgyz equestrian sports . 
riders display their prowess ,  accompanied by folk concerts and storytelling . 
in addition to local horsemen ,  the kyrgyz aty festival was attended by equestrian enthusiasts from kazakhstan ,  tajikistan ,  germany and france . 
kazakhstan :  agricultural show and food market
the prime minister emphasised :  with the world economy suffering a food shortage ,  the development of kazakhstans agriculture gains great significance . 
taking part in the karaotkel-2008 show were over <num>200</num>  organisations from all over kazakhstan ,  representing production in a variety of agrarian sectors . 
there were almost <num>20</num>  organisations present selling agricultural equipment and over <num>30</num>  livestock farms . 
also represented at the show were a number of horticultural and fish processing plants . 
the situation regarding kazakhstans food market is ,  however ,  rather more complicated than was made out at the show . 
climatic conditions play a substantial role in kazakhstan . 
the ktk tv channel has reported that ,  thanks to the current drought ,  sheep herders are intending to slaughter most of their livestock before autumn . 
the tv channel reported that in the space of two months most of the pastureland in the almaty region has dried out . 
meteorological forecasts for august are not reassuring . 
the air temperature is not expected to fall below <num>40</num>  degrees over the next few days . 
this question was debated recently at an annual congress of sheep herders in the almaty region . 
the farmers say that the drought means most of the livestock will have to be slaughtered ,  the tv channel reported . 
climate is ,  however ,  not the only problem affecting food production and consumption . 
the food crisis currently affecting many of the worlds countries is also being felt in kazakhstan . 
kazakhstan is <num>67</num> -<num>75</num>  percent self-sufficient with regard to food production ,  tolegin sydykhov ,  first deputy chairman of the adilet democratic party ,  announced in the course of a press conference . 
that means we are not guaranteed food security . 
countries which import over <num>16</num>  percent of their domestic food consumption are more susceptible to a food crisis ,  sydykhov emphasised . 
according to him ,  if imports of a particular type of product reach <num>20</num>  percent of domestic production volumes then there is a danger of domestic production slowing down . 
if that figure reaches <num>60</num>  percent then domestic production will cease completely . 
in his opinion ,  changing the approach to agrarian policy is an imperative . 
we have to consider how much we consume ,  how much we are short and how much prepared food we need to produce ,  he insisted . 
karaoke evolves as popular entertainment in bishkek
ayturgay sings at the michael karaoke club in bishkek . 
karaoke has become trendy in the kyrgyz capital . 
bishkek - karaoke clubs are becoming increasingly popular as bishkek dwellers pass their free time in them now that restaurants and discotheques have become passe . 
not long ago we conducted our own market research and found that in bishkek there are more than <num>40</num>  karaoke clubs ,  <num>15</num>  of which opened only in the last month and a half . 
the price of admission to karaoke clubs ranges from <num>100</num> -<num>800</num>  som  ( us <num>2</num>  $ -<num>16</num>  )  . 
club owners say that with the increase in competition they will have to lower the prices ,  but the business is still lucrative and attracts many customers . 
it seems to me the main reason for karaokes popularity is that people really loving to sing ,  especially young people ,  said rysbek amankulov ,  the manager of another karaoke club . 
programmes hyping young pop singers ,  which are gaining momentum ,  play a certain role . 
the possibility of becoming a star makes a young persons head spin . 
everyone wants to take the microphone and feel like a real artist . 
he said some of his regular customers are preparing themselves for the pop scene ,  perceiving karaoke clubs as a training ground for their entrance onto the big stage . 
in amankulovs club ,  the prices are moderate and everyone who holds the microphone gets into the public eye . 
our customers want to hear themselves ,  not special effects ,  to learn to independently keep their poise in public . 
in short ,  they are seriously preparing for the stage . 
in another karaoke club ,  which has a vip section ,  it costs <num>700</num>  som  ( us <num>14</num>  $  )  to spend an hour in a separate booth with a girl singing backup . 
our clients are people of all different ages and nationalities ,  said anastasia ,  a backup singer at the club . 
office workers ,  businessmen and students come here . 
they all want to have a good time ,  relieve stress ,  celebrate a family anniversary ,  celebrate a birthday with friends . 
in short ,  there are many excuses ,  and the selection of karaoke clubs in bishkek is as vast  ( as the list of reasons to go )  . 
restaurants ,  cafes and discotheques are no longer fashionable . 
according to her ,  karaoke clubs differ from simple clubs and restaurants in that their clients can forget all their problems . 
restaurants and cafes cannot give what karaoke clubs do :  the possibility not just to listen ,  but to sing your favourite songs yourself "  ,  said uluk ,  a young man patronising the club . 
 " good music and songs always recharge a person with positive energy . 
here ,  i cut loose to the max and get a charge of energy that lasts a long time "  . 
one club manager said tastes vary . 
older patrons prefer old kyrgyz songs ,  while young people prefer modern foreign and russian pop songs . 
marat negmatov ,  producer of a music programme at raketa-tv ,  said plans are underway to hold a televised contest for karaoke amateurs in bishkek . 
details of that have not been released . 
kyrgyzstan protests unesco's listing of epic of manas as chinese
manaschi mirlan zhumaliyev performs in talat ,  a town near bishkek . 
 [ meri bekesheva ] 
bishkek - kyrgyzstan is up in arms over what it considers the chinese theft of a kyrgyz cultural heritage . 
the epic poem is of unknowable age . 
the kyrgyz government proclaimed and celebrated the poems 1 , 000t anniversary in <num>1995</num>  , but the first time the text surfaced was in a <num>1792</num> -<num>93</num>  persian manuscript . 
dozens of versions exist ,  with the longest containing about <num>500,000</num>  lines . 
the decision has led to protests from kyrgyz officials and poem reciters  ( called manaschi )  alike ,  since the state has promoted it as an artefact of kyrgyz nationhood . 
it chronicles the exploits of manas and his descendants against the kitay and kalmak . 
we read on the unesco website that manas had become one of chinas three main epics and were simply shocked ,  said jypar jeksheyev ,  former chairman of the kyrgyz national commission on unesco affairs . 
neither chinas unesco commission nor the kyrgyz living in china told us . 
he added that china had appropriated tibetan values and holy places and calls genghis khan a great chinese emperor . 
attributing the epic of manas to china undermines unescos credibility ,  akimov said . 
he recalled that unesco officials had attended kyrgyzstans millennial celebration of the poem in <num>1995</num>  .
the un agency listed the storytelling art of manaschi as an item of kyrgyzstans intangible cultural heritage in <num>2003</num>  .
political researcher jyrgalbek kasabolotov gave two reasons for chinas behaviour :  first ,  it is portraying itself as a protector of minority cultures and second ,  it wants documented possession of the kyrgyz peoples cultural property . 
tomorrow ,  turkey will also be able to lay claim to the epic of manas ,  since kyrgyz live there too ,  warned bakyt orunbekov ,  an instructor at the kyrgyz-turkish manas university in bishkek . 
krygyz live in afghanistan and russia - they could submit a joint nomination . 
… manas should belong only to kyrgyzstan and to all kyrgyz around the world . 
manas rallied his scattered people and defeated the peoples principal enemy ,  the chinese ,  said samat kochorbayev ,  who has won several storytelling contests . 
only the kyrgyz can understand the essence and idea of manas . 
now i fear that the chinese <abbr>…</abbr>  will start making cartoons and movies about the epic of manas . 
dushanbe opera and ballet theatre hopes to regain audience
dancers oleg kharitonov ,  mariya mirzoyeva and kurbon zakirov perform in cinderella . 
the tajik opera and ballet theatre re-opened in <num>2009</num>  after major repairs . 
its management hopes to woo back audiences . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
now ,  after years of civil war and dislocations ,  tajik ballerinas and opera singers perform to half-empty auditoriums . 
but the management of the sadriddin aini state opera and ballet theatre intends to return to its glory days . 
the theatre re-opened in spring <num>2009</num>  after major repairs prompted by tajik president emomali rakhmon ,  who ,  in <num>2004</num>  , declared the crumbling building in need of renovation . 
the first ballet staged after the reopening was don quixote ,  recalled dushanbe resident mastona rakhmonkulova . 
it was a bit of a pity that tajik dancers didnt perform the main roles ,  she said . 
instead ,  kyrgyz dancers starred . 
after the opening ,  we filled the house with the operas rudaki and aida . 
gerardo colella ,  the conductor from italy ,  was invited to the theatre . 
he put on aida in italian . 
soon ,  tajik audiences will see carmen in french . 
in each of the productions there are ballet cut-ins ,  said maliyev . 
the troupe now has <num>12</num>  members ,  she said . 
everybody else left the country . 
theatre employees say the main problem is the lack of young performers . 
according to theatre vice director izzatullo samadov ,  ten teenagers from tajikistan are studying at the perm state choreographic school in russia . 
azamatova said they are contractually obligated to come back to tajikistan . 
six years ago a dance college opened in dushanbe ,  but most of the students come from  ( tajik )  families ,  she said . 
religion and tradition keep many such parents from allowing their children ,  especially girls ,  to go onstage after graduating ,  azamatova said . 
because of the lack of young ballerinas ,  men now perform womens roles . 
we have to change clothes several times in one performance ,  said one honoured tajik dancer aleksandr bakhman ,  who has been in more than <num>50</num>  ballets in his <num>18</num>  years on the stage . 
she said it is essential to reach children in order to lock up audiences for future years . 
take a look - the audience is now very small and ,  more and more ,  made up of older folks . 
troupe leader valentina anuchina ,  <num>57</num>  , complained that the dancers need new costumes . 
we perform in costumes that are older than we are ,  she said . 
that will be fixed eventually . 
the huge building has now been restored . 
soon the decor and wardrobe will be updated ,  majidov said . 
those who want to keep dancing in tajikistan must love their craft and look past the low wages . 
ballet is hard work ,  and the pay of us <num>100</num>  $  per month in no way covers it ,  said bakhman . 
box office receipts are still small . 
but we were able to raise the salaries for the performers . 
at night ,  bakhman dances in a restaurant to supplement his income . 
even if tajik ballets not going through the best of times ,  i do not want to leave the stage ,  he said . 
there is no meaning to life without dance . 
azamatova is not going anywhere either :  hopefully ,  i will wait for new ,  young dancers and fulfil my precious dream of staging swan lake here "  ,  she said . 
the region has some other opera and ballet theatres . 
presently ,  the alisher navoi state academic bolshoi theatre in tashkent is considered one of the best . 
astana ,  almaty ,  shymkent and bishkek also have their own opera and ballet theatres . 
beer drinking undergoes resurgence in kyrgyzstan
beer is gaining popularity in kyrgyzstan ,  with the opening of two pubs that brew their own beer . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
bishkek - theres a new group garnering interest in kyrgyzstan . 
its small ,  but its growing and its very active :  beer drinkers . 
kyrgyzstans national statistics committee reported that one-sixth of the countrys adult population drinks beer regularly . 
the domestic market consumes <num>50</num>  meter  litres of beer annually ,  two-thirds of which is imported . 
thats about <num>10</num>  litres a year for each of kyrgyzstans <num>5.3</num>  meter  residents . 
this lags behind the czech republic ,  which led the world in <num>2004</num>  with a per-capita beer consumption of <num>156.9</num>  litres annually ,  according to japans kirin holdings company . 
in kazakhstan ,  per-capita consumption in <num>2006</num>  was about <num>26</num>  litres ,  according to estimates . 
kyrgyzstans national statistics committee ranks the country 96t in the world in annual alcohol consumption per capita . 
bishkek boasts six beer pubs ,  two of which - steinbrau and blonder pub - have their own breweries . 
no other cities in the country have beer pubs ,  although there are cafes and beer stands where the brew is available - and for less than in the fancier pubs . 
kyrgyz supreme mufti murataly azhy jumanov said the availability of beer does not scare the muftiate ,  but it is wary . 
jumanov said the consumption even of low-alcohol beverages is a sin . 
in the quran there are places where it indirectly suggests that one cannot drink alcohol ,  he said . 
orthodox muslims do not drink . 
everyone who drinks must atone for this sin . 
the country regularly has beer festivals . 
kyrgyzstan has ,  by regional standards ,  a long brewing history . 
the first brewery opened in kara-kol in the 19t century . 
by the beginning of the 20t century ,  five breweries were producing beer . 
during soviet times ,  osh ,  kara-balta ,  talas and kochkor had breweries brewing up to <num>30</num>  meter  litres annually . 
but as elsewhere during the anti-alcohol campaign of the <num>1980</num>  second  ,  production was cut ,  leading drinkers to consume other forms of alcohol . 
currently ,  kyrgyzstan has two major breweries :  abdysh-ata and arpa ,  which produce more than <num>90</num>  %  of the countrys beer . 
smaller breweries are in osh ,  kochkor and jalal-abad . 
in a given year ,  the country produces approximately <num>15</num>  meter  litres of beer . 
most of this is consumed locally ,  with a small portion exported to kazakhstan and russia . 
imported beer ,  which totals approximately <num>35</num>  meter  litres per year ,  mostly comes from russia ,  kazakhstan and germany . 
kyrgyzstan has no beer distributors ,  so breweries deliver their product to bulk buyers . 
abdulmezhit yusurov ,  a quality control specialist for the german firm steinecker ,  said brewing beer is not difficult . 
the technology is simple ,  but everything depends on human variables ,  yusurov said . 
if you become lazy or ,  on the contrary ,  overly hasty ,  the beer will have a completely different flavour . 
yusurov said he became a brewmaster accidentally ,  but he enjoys his work . 
it is all very easy . 
brewing beer requires malt ,  hops and barley - none of which kyrgyz farmers grow . 
abdulmezhit said all the raw materials are imported :  mostly kazakhstan and germany supply the basic ingredients . 
the additives are from austria and china . 
switch to domestic raw materials ? 
thats a possibility but only in theory . 
traditionally ,  almost no barley is grown in kyrgyzstan . 
the domestic brewer abdysh-ata uses some domestic raw materials in some of its production . 
foreign raw materials means producers have to charge more for their beer . 
another problem for the beer industry is the lack of equipment and filters . 
yusurov said that germany supplies most of the equipment but that very few breweries can afford it . 
victoria ,  a manager of one of the beer pubs ,  doesnt agree . 
she said ,  the beer is being prepared according to foreign technologies ,  and thats why the taste doesnt differ . 
if you taste the beer in the czech republic or taste beer made according to the czech recipe here in bishkek ,  you will find no difference . 
consumers opinions vary . 
a student named maksim said he can determine the quality and approximate production date of any beer . 
he has been to beer festivals in germany and the czech republic and said kyrgyz beer does not stand up to the competition . 
music returns to pashtun land
instrument makers in the dabgari bazaar craft dohl . 
pashtu music is enjoying a revival in the pashtun belt after troops drove out the taliban . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
peshawar - musical instruments and dancing have returned to the pashtun belt after years of taliban-imposed austerity . 
ever since pakistani troops pushed out the taliban ,  more singers and dancers are cropping up in peshawar . 
the taliban had made such festivities impossible in areas under their control . 
the number of concerts ,  dancing shows and activities at theatres has been increasing fast in  ( peshawar )  for the last one or two months ,  said mudassir zaman ,  a budding pashtu singer . 
pashtu music and songs are being appreciated globally ,  and that was why even english students <abbr>…</abbr>  in london last month performed my song khaperai  ,  he said . 
zaman has two songs that reflect the pashtun belts tragic situation since <num>2004</num>  :  nen pekhawar jaregi ,  about the woes of peshawarites enduring terrorist attacks and yau zali bia daa pekhawar ba khandee ,  which holds out hope of a brighter future . 
nishtar hall ,  a hub of cultural activities ,  has reopened after a long period of going dark . 
bearded elders ,  youth and visitors from all over the province and the federally administered tribal areas participated in a cultural dance event ,  atanr ,  after a peace conference in that building . 
the dabgari bazaar ,  a narrow peshawar boulevard with ancient wooden buildings on both sides ,  was once the hub of pashtu singers ,  dancers ,  musical groups and shops of handmade musical instruments . 
intimidation reduced the number of shops making the traditional pashtu musical instrument ,  the rabab ,  to two . 
we along with several families of dancers used to live in dabgari ,  but we shifted to faqirabad after threats ,  said sana ,  a <num>22</num> -year-old dancer . 
post-taliban relaxation means female dancers are no longer reluctant to perform in weddings and shows ,  sana said . 
she and her sister have resumed dancing . 
they represent an unusual subculture in pakistan ,  that of dancers and singers ,  who celebrate the birth of girls as potential performers . 
most of the families of dancers and singers are living in miserable conditions in two-room scruffy rented houses . 
the taliban did their best to crush art and culture in the region ,  but they conferred a blessing in disguise on artists like ghazala javed and karan khan . 
they were forced to migrate from swat to comparatively stable peshawar ,  where they found wealth and fame in a bigger marketplace . 
a large number of female pashtun entertainers hail from the swat valley . 
a new ,  educated generation of singers has introduced pashtu music to the entire world . 
rahim shah ,  a mainstream artist ,  had the major contribution in promoting pashtu music across the country . 
hadeeqa kyani ,  a non-pashtun popular singer ,  performed janan after finding inspiration in pashtu music and poetry . 
after having young and educated artists like haroon bacha ,  zeek afridi ,  hamayun khan ,  fiza fayaz ,  janas khan and irfan khan ,  pashtu music was going to touch new heights ,  but its flight was suddenly interrupted by threats ,  said isra bacha ,  a music lover from malakand . 
haroon bacha and several others had to seek asylum in the us and european countries after feeling unsafe in pakistan ,  he said . 
the community remains scarred by the talibans execution of shabana ,  a popular dancer ,  in swat in january <num>2009</num>  .
that event caused a lack of entertainment activity for months . 
it also remembers the bombing of hundreds of movie theatres and cd shops thought to be un-islamic . 
militants and their sympathisers remain capable of striking . 
a march <num>28</num>  bombing of a cd shop in hayatabad township wounded five people and destroyed three businesses . 
but the big difference is that the taliban are no longer in charge . 
a very slim number of people used to go to the cinema ,  but their number has been increasing for many weeks ,  said mohammad fayaz ,  who has produced two pashtu movies and runs a cinema . 
many say the performing community has an even more harmful enemy than the taliban :  apathy by senior artists and the government . 
cheap dances and poetry are not only harming pashtu music but also the culture "  ,  complained emerging singer janas khan ,  who has released three albums so far . 
he also said senior performers should promote the pashtu language ,  since punjabi and other regional languages enjoy such promotion . 
sufi festival attracts masses
lahore -- the sounds of violence and militancy were briefly pushed aside last week as more than <num>400</num>  performers from australia ,  germany ,  afghanistan and pakistan performed in the 8th international mystic music sufi festival in lahore . 
the organisers goal was to showcase islams rich diversity of devotional expression through the performing arts . 
music plays an important role in sufism ,  which embraces pacifism ,  as well as other islamic schools of devotion and thought . 
we hope the experience of the festival will assist an understanding of muslims as those who submit to god and seek the middle path of balance between faith and world <abbr>…</abbr>  avoiding extremes ,  peerzada said . 
they enlightened and entertained through various musical pieces ,  qawalis dhikr ,  kalams and song-and-dance performances by whirling artists . 
sufi and other esoteric traditions of islam manifest their devotion through diverse expressions ranging from ecstatic movement in dance to meditative exercises ,  naeem tabish told central asia online . 
tabish ,  from afghanistan ,  leads the mystic qawali group . 
only an illiterate mind accepts hatred ,  violence and oppression as legitimate tools of religion ,  he said . 
events like these face challenges - such as financial obstacles and terrorism - in the tough pakistani environment ,  said faizaan peerzada ,  chairman of the rafi peer theatre workshop . 
through the sufi festival ,  we look forward to highlighting the <abbr>…</abbr>  warmth and wisdom of sufi poetry ,  he said . 
sufi music is popular all over the world for its healing touch . 
the subcontinent ,  especially the sindh and punjab provinces ,  is rich in sufi heritage and tradition ,  with shrines honouring the spirit ,  poetry ,  dance and music of the sufi masters . 
sufi mystics have made rich contributions to the arts ,  rendering some of the most beautiful poetry and music ,  their philosophy being the driving force behind many lives ,  peerzada said . 
he suggested creating an international platform to project sufi thoughts . 
growing extremism and terrorism ,  especially in the ranks of muslims ,  are a threat to unity in the whole muslim ummah ,  and we should play our due role in curbing this menace ,  he said . 
by bringing together a diverse lineup of artists from different parts of the globe ,  the festival has not only highlighted the universal and tolerant face of islam to the west ,  it has fostered better understanding within the muslim world . 
foreign militants fighting in pakistans tribal belt
government forces faced up to <num>10,000</num>  militants ,  including <num>1,000</num>  foreign fighters ,  in the south waziristan area of operations ,  he said . 
one belonged to said bahaji ,  a german national ,  and the other to a muslim woman from spain . 
sherwangi was a hub of foreign fighters ,  said brigadier mohammed shafiq . 
in the ladha area ,  we intercepted communications revealing the presence of a large number of foreign militants ,  mostly arabs and uzbeks . 
shafiq said the foreign militants had a number of passports and names . 
since the current army operation began ,  foreign militants have largely fled . 
uzbeks along with their families are also fleeing from the area of fighting to relocate to new safe havens in north waziristan . 
kashmiri militants are increasingly joining hands with pro-taliban elements ,  abbas said . 
the militants who belonged to ilyas kashmirs harkat-ul-jihadul islami  ( huji )  have joined with ttp in sponsoring multi-pronged suicide attacks…in different parts of the country . 
among the other militant groups ,  the hizbul mujahideen  ( hum )  ,  or party of freedom ,  are responsible for terror attacks in jammu and kashmir . 
troubled kazakh youth find purpose to life in ancient burial site
kazakh teenagers rebuild an ancient burial kurgan in altyn-emel national park . 
the program gives troubled juveniles a sense of purpose and teaches an appreciation for history and culture . 
 [ jamila sujud ] 
its the kind of work usually done by university archaeology students ,  but their numbers are limited ,  and their time is constrained by classroom studies . 
in november ,  the tabigat ecological union ,  an environmental group in kazakhstan ,  organized three <num>10</num> -day expeditions to help rebuild the besshatyr kurgan complex in the altyn-emel national park in the almaty oblast . 
of the <num>300</num>  young people who participated ,  about <num>100</num>  of them are youths who have had problems in school ,  at home and sometimes with the law . 
altyn emel park is one of the largest protected preserves in kazakhstan ,  with some <num>460,000</num>  hectares of territory . 
it has some <num>18</num>  early-iron age saka culture kurgans dating from the 4th and 5th centuries bc and more than <num>200</num>  archeological sites . 
the kurgans vary from <num>2</num>  to <num>20</num>  metres high and <num>8</num>  to <num>70</num>  metres in diameter . 
the largest kurgans are <num>25</num>  metres high ,  <num>70</num>  metres in diameter ,  with circumferences of <num>250</num>  metres . 
according to scientists ,  altyn-emel was a political center of the scythian state during the reign of queen tomyris ,  about <num>530</num>  bc . 
in the <num>1950</num>  second  ,  soviet archeologists destroyed many of the kurgans ,  including three large royal kurgans ,  when they excavated them with bulldozers . 
while many of the young people who participated in the three november expeditions came from technical and vocational schools in the area ,  simply recruiting low cost manpower is not tabigats only reason for turning to young people to do the rebuilding and restoration work . 
such actions help them better learn the history of their native country ,  she said . 
they have come home in a very positive mood . 
to add to what the boys ,  ruslan and kayrat ,  have seen and learned in the field ,  esimenko has had them read articles about the scythian state and the era of queen tomyris . 
after the expedition they became interested in the kurgans and began to read books about kazakhstans history . 
difficult teenagers need more attention and patience than others ,  esimenko said ,  adding ,  we must take control of difficult boys behavior before it is too late . 
the problem of difficult teenagers is a very real for kazakhstan . 
according to the ministry of internal affairs of kazakhstan ,  more than <num>20.000</num>  teenagers in the country ,  and some <num>4,000</num>  in almaty ,  are registered with juvenile authorities for things ranging from simple misbehavior to serious crimes . 
law-enforcement and social agencies ,  already burdened with more serious problems ,  are unable to cope with the teenagers . 
many go on to join criminal groups . 
confusion favors militancy in pakistan
a suicide car bomb blast on the outskirts of peshawar leaves <num>12</num>  dead november <num>15</num>  .
 [ hassan khan ] 
attacks on innocent people in busy markets leave citizens perplexed as to whether they are being attacked by taliban militants or anti-pakistan agencies . 
the waziristan operation has prompted militants to change their earlier strategy of hitting specific targets ,  such as security personnel and installations . 
in a state of apparent frenzy ,  militants have let loose a brigade of suicide bombers who hit public places and busy markets to create confusion . 
the extreme nervousness of the militants is evident in attacks at places like meena bazaar ,  a passenger bus at khyber bazaar ,  a roadside market at badabir ,  a cattle market in adizai area ,  a roadside market in charsadda ,  and in front of commercial bank in rawalpindi where elderly people were waiting in queue to collect pensions . 
several bombers blew up before reaching their targets -- like at the gate of the district courts in peshawar ,  near the police posts at pishtakhara and ring road ,  and near the police investigation offices at swato paatak in peshawar . 
these blasts and many others ,  claiming more than <num>300</num>  innocent lives ,  have happened since october <num>17</num>  - the day the military moved <num>30,000</num>  troops into mehsud territory of waziristan . 
the mountainous terrain inhibited by mehsud tribe is known to be a hub of hakimullah mehsud-led tehrik taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  . 
mehsud took charge of the loosely knit ttp after the august <num>5</num>  death of baitullah mehsud and his wife in a missile attack . 
after a successful military operation in malakand division ,  particularly against the fazllullah-led militants in swat ,  the military decided to launch a decisive waziristan battle . 
before october ,  there had been half-hearted military actions in tribal areas that mostly ended in military-militant agreements favoring the latter . 
after each agreement ,  the government surrendered control of local administration to militants . 
in swat ,  both agreements were just surrendering to militants ,  a senior politician afzal khan lala told central asia online in a phone interview . 
khan lala ,  who survived two assassination attempts by militants ,  said militants started administering justice ,  controlling police posts and patrolling the streets freely after both agreements . 
a senior parliamentarian from fata ,  speaking on condition of anonymity ,  said that in waziristan the militants were literally handed over the agency after the signing of each agreement between the military and militants . 
militants use these agreements as golden opportunities to regroup ,  and eliminate tribal elders who supported military operations ,  the fata parliamentarian said . 
a common perception is the militants are striving to create a vacuum by eliminating the social and cultural base in society and creating a space to establish a puritanical regime based on their own version of divinity . 
a pakistan peoples party member of the national assembly from bajaur ,  akhunzada chitaan ,  said that for years now there is no social or cultural life in tribal areas . 
they  ( militants )  abolished by force the century old tribal jirga system ,  chitaan said . 
khan lala believes that confronted by the military in waziristan ,  these militants have become desperate ,  leading them to targeting innocent people in busy markets . 
but by delaying decisive action ,  the government provides the militants enough time to brainwash and prepare teenagers to be suicide bombers . 
if the swat and waziristan operations were finished properly two years back ,  these militants would not have opportunity to train so many suicide bombers ,  khan lala said . 
the sudden surge in suicide blasts at public places after south waziristan offensive has created a lot of fear among the people . 
markets are deserted today ,  as people have stopped visiting crowded places due to fear of attacks . 
schools and colleges were closed after a deadly suicide attack at islamic international university islamabad . 
god knows better ,  but i believe people of mangal bagh are doing this ,  said sardar hussain ,  a taxi driver who claims to have narrowly escaped a deadly khyber bazaar car blast in peshawar . 
many people believe the suicide attacks are made by the now-desperate militants . 
militants are targeting innocent people to compel government stop operation in waziristan ,  said inaam-ur-rehman ,  a lecturer at international islamic university islamabad . 
however ,  a segment in the oppositions political circle and pro-government commentators believe enemies of pakistan might be exploiting the situation for their interests . 
among them are leading opposition politicians and retired military officers who sympathize with the taliban . 
this split between the pakistani intelligentsia and political leadership is mostly benefiting the militants . 
the cliche a muslim will never kill an innocent person has been proven false by the recent bombings ,  but is nonetheless creating sympathies for militants among the masses . 
islamabad-based journalist shahab yusufzai pointed out that sensing a strong reaction in people against blasts at public places like markets ,  militants have begun to disown these acts of terrorism . 
but peoples hate against militants is universal ,  yusufzai said ,  because memories of the people regarding militants atrocities in swat are still fresh . 
people are also confused by the prevalent different perspectives regarding militancy and perpetrators of suicide blasts . 
the majority believe militants are fighting for establishing their own regime ,  said khadim hussian ,  a professor at air university in islamabad . 
kazakhstan promotes healthy lifestyles
representatives in kazakhstan discuss ways to promote healthy lifestyles at a recent meeting . 
 [ jamila sujud ] 
almaty ,  kazakhstan - kazakhstan wants its residents to get fit . 
by pushing a program to change the mind-set of up-and-coming generations ,  one positive effect might be to offset the incidence of cardiovascular disease ,  traditionally the nations top killer ,  according to statistics from the world health organization  ( who )  . 
that was part of the backdrop for a december <num>22</num>  roundtable in almaty held for nongovernmental organizations . 
the goal was to figure out how to popularise healthy lifestyles  ( hls )  . 
almaty akimat ,  the almaty centre for promoting healthy lifestyle ,  and via communication have teamed up to prepare an anti-alcohol promotional video that recently aired on the youth television station hit-tv . 
however ,  according to via communication general director saule bigaleyeva ,  no measures of an administrative type will have an effect since human culture causes this  ( unhealthy living )  . 
smoking and drinking are two cultural activities that contribute to unhealthy lifestyles
citing research from <num>2008</num>  , national centre for problems of healthy lifestyle development general director saule dikanbayeva said that ,  excluding hookah smokers ,  <num>27</num>  percent of kazakhstans population are smokers . 
dikanbayeva says a healthy lifestyle needs to be taught at an early age . 
with this in mind ,  the centre has conducted a series of meetings for representatives of schools and the food service industry about the dangers of fast food :  we are not against fast food ,  but it should not be the norm . 
for three years the centre has been working on introducing quality ,  hot foods into schools and higher-education establishments in almaty . 
with the support of unicef ,  four youth health centres have opened . 
there ,  young people can discuss issues not only with peers ,  but also with doctors . 
in the next five years ,  <num>25</num>  such centres will open across the country . 
the practice of developing hls is widely used in large business enterprises via the payment of pool and fitness club memberships ,  food provision ,  medical insurance and passes to health resorts ,  said larisa meshkova ,  project manager for the kazakhstan entrepreneurs forum . 
there have been a series of cases where companies that manufacture tobacco products have initiated campaigns to support public health by conducting campaigns to prevent smoking among minors ,  she added . 
but meshkova said that such practices do not apply to small businesses . 
in difficult economic conditions ,  employers are focused to a greater extent on survival ,  on preserving their workplace and ,  most importantly ,  on paying their taxes ,  she said . 
meshkova thinks that ,  in this respect ,  the states role in the hls development process for small businesses becomes more important . 
if active hls development programs were to reduce the tax load or to give preference in bidding for state tenders ,  it would be a powerful motivation and condition for the further development of the organisation ,  meshkova said . 
attacks on kyrgyz journalists threaten press freedom

kyrgyz journalists say the government seems indifferent to increasing attacks that are forcing some reporters into exile . 
 [ yoray liberman / getty images ] 
bishkek-- i was riding in a taxi at night when we were stopped by the traffic police on one of the streets of osh . 
they asked us to step out of the vehicle and said that the cab driver smelled like alcohol . 
in the heat of the argument ,  several people came up to me and forced me aside . 
the next morning found me in the local hospital with moderate traumas . 
kubanychbek dzholdoshev is a journalist with <num>10</num>  years of experience working for tv companies in bishkek and osh . 
the father of two is one of a growing number of journalists who have been attacked in the past two years . 
i was surprised that the officers didnt do anything . 
i didnt see them ,  but they should have heard that something was going on . 
also ,  in a couple of days after the incident ,  the chief editor of the newspaper i work for found a letter in his office addressed to me containing threats and a machine gun bullet ,  dzholdoshev said . 
despite the increase in attacks ,  government ombudsman tursunbek akun ,  believes that not every one of the two dozen attacks on the journalists is connected with their professional activity . 
of course ,  there are several incidents supported by the proven facts . 
the attacks have been the subject of several seminars involving human rights advocates and mass media representatives . 
the most recent was in connection with the killing of kyrgyz journalist ,  gennady pavlyuk . 
on december <num>16</num>  , pavlyuk was found unconscious in almaty . 
a kazakhstan ministry of internal affairs press service representative ,  who asked to remain anonymous ,  told central asia online the journalist was tied up and thrown out of a sixth floor window . 
pavlyuk died december <num>22</num>  after six days in a coma . 
the commercial kazakh television station ktk reported december <num>30</num>  , that sources in the kazakh power structures said three agents of kyrgyz state security met with pavlyuk in the apartment from which he was thrown to his death . 
kyrgyz journalists are not the only ones being beaten in bishkek . 
on december <num>15</num>  , russian journalist alexander evgrafov ,  a reporter for baltinfo in kyrgyzstan ,  said he was approached by two men in police uniforms who beat him when he refused to get into a car with them . 
opposition deputies have expressed their regret about the lack of any meaningful reaction by kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev and the government . 
in the meantime ,  the ministry of home affairs notified the press that it has stopped investigating the spring <num>2009</num>  attack on syrgak abdyldaev ,  political columnist for the reporter bishkek newspaper and a member of the ata-meken  ( fatherland )  opposition party . 
iran unlikely to gain nuclear material from central asia
iranian technicians work in a uranium conversion facility in <num>2005</num>  near isfahan ,  about <num>410</num>  kilometres south of tehran . 
iran has reportedly sought to secretly buy uranium from kazakhstan ,  but some experts say the effort is unlikely to be successful because of international treaties and safeguards . 
 [ getty images ] 
almaty - reports that iran may reach out to central asia to replenish its waning uranium reserves sparked concerns last week about how easily the aspiring nuclear power could acquire nuclear materials . 
but with treaties in place ,  a reliance on western relations and increased oversight ,  several experts said they believe it would be extremely difficult for iran to make a deal - overtly or covertly - without some knowledge on the part of nuclear security officials . 
shamil yenikeev ,  a leading political expert on central asia at oxford university ,  added that a deal by kazakhstan with iran could be a huge blow to kazakh foreign policy in the region . 
yenikeev added that it would not just have regional implications ,  but wide-reaching effects on iran and kazakhstan as they strive to grow as regional and global powers . 
a uranium deal between kazakhstan and iran will not only violate the un security council sanctions against iran but will also undermine kazakhstans credibility as the <num>2010</num>  osce chair ,  he said . 
togzhan kassenova ,  senior research associate for the centre for international trade and security at the university of georgia ,  agreed . 
there are no grounds to believe that kazakhstan would ever consider making any kind of deal in violation of international non-proliferation norms and un security council resolutions ,  with iran or any other country ,  she said . 
kazakhstan has a laudable non-proliferation track record . 
the country got rid of more than a thousand nuclear weapons present on its territory at the time of the soviet collapse . 
kassenova added that any deal with iran would likely have an economic toll for kazakhstan ,  which produced about <num>14,000</num>  tonnes of uranium in <num>2009</num>  , to become the worlds largest producer of the material . 
a secretive deal with iran could hurt its ability to remain the largest producer . 
it is highly unlikely the government of kazakhstan or the management of the state-owned uranium production company kazatomprom would be interested in pursuing any deals that would undermine the countrys political or commercial reputation ,  she said . 
while kazakhstan has a large quantity of enriched uranium from the soviet era ,  that material has been deemed a high enough risk that security has been upgraded to included iaea supervision . 
mukhatzhanova said security of natural uranium mines is not as strict ,  but so much of the material would be needed that any smuggling operation would require so many people that the suspicions of government or foreign officials would be raised . 
i dont believe that the government would sanction such a sale ,  considering political costs involved and the fact that kazakhstan has by now gained some experience with export controls . 
i should hope that people working at kazatomprom and in the ministry of energy are competent in these areas . 
kassenova agreed that a secret deal or an attempt to move the material secretly is unlikely . 
the suggestion that the alleged deal was negotiated outside of official channels appears unsubstantiated because it involved more than a tonne of purified uranium ore ,  not some simple transaction of regular commodities ,  she said . 
rakhmon has repeatedly expressed support for irans peaceful nuclear power program . 
but ,  mukhatzhanova said ,  tajik uranium reserves are all but wiped out ,  despite rakhmons assertion in a <num>2008</num>  speech that the nation still had <num>13</num>  percent of the worlds reserves . 
according to a report by the non-proliferation think tank nuclear threat initiative ,  vostokredmet ,  which processed up to one million tonnes of uranium ore per year for the soviets ,  processes only a small amount of uranium now . 
several chinese and russian companies had discussed deals in the late <num>1990</num>  second  and early <num>2000</num>  second  to process uranium at the combine ,  but so far none have come to fruition ,  the nti report said . 
tajikistans maternal mortality rate still high
a young girl waits for her mother in the hallway of a reproductive health clinic ,  in gham khori ,  tajikistan in this <num>2007</num>  file photo . 
the tajik government hopes to reduce high levels of maternal and infant mortality by <num>75</num>  percent by <num>2015</num>  through improvements in reproductive health and family planning services . 
 [ warrick page / getty images ] 
in an interview with central asia online ,  she noted that the government had adopted a number of acts on reproductive health ,  a national strategy on reproductive health ,  and family planning including the strategic plan for reproductive health and the safe motherhood program . 
according to the world health organization  ( who )  ,  the infant mortality in tajikistan is high and the maternal mortality is the highest in the region . 
according to a who online database ,  in <num>2006</num>  tajikistan had the highest infant mortality in central asia ,  with <num>56</num>  deaths per <num>1,000</num>  live births . 
for the same year ,  kazakhstan had the lowest infant mortality rate of <num>26</num>  deaths per <num>1,000</num>  live births . 
the ministry of health reports that the maternal mortality rate in the country dropped from <num>40.8</num>  women per <num>100,000</num>  live births in <num>2008</num>  to <num>30.8</num>  per <num>100,000</num>  live births in <num>2009</num>  .
the who provided the same figures ,  but said the data varies depending on the region of the country . 
jobirova said the reasons for this are :  ill-equipped maternity clinics ;  lack of necessary equipment ;  and shortages of obstetrical kits ,  mirrors and scalpels . 
she also said many tajik women die from not receiving obstetric care in a timely manner :  women who live far from regional centres do not have the ability to seek out healthcare facilities . 
a unicef study found that in addition to high maternal mortality ,  infant mortality is also high during the first week and the second month of life . 
the study showed the infant mortality rate is higher in rural areas than in urban ones . 
among the causes of death are the combination of premature birth and low birth weight ,  improper management of maternal care ,  acute anaemia ,  diarrhea ,  malnutrition and infectious diseases . 
unicef noted that in tajikistan the per-capita number of health professionals is lower than in the other central asian countries . 
in <num>2003</num>  , their pay amounted to only half of the average salary and one-fifth of the salary for workers with the same level of qualifications in other industries . 
the lower remuneration has helped reduce the status of these workers and appealing to them to work on improving the quality of their services has proven a difficult challenge ,  the report said . 
jobirova said the ministry of health offered training for medical staff . 
we published a lot of literature that had been unavailable to health workers . 
she said the government should work with women inside the family-with mothers and mothers-in-law-to increase every community members awareness of pregnancy danger signs in order to bring women to medical facilities on time so they can get medical help . 
pregnant women should eat high-calorie foods ,  but ,  as a rule ,  it is not possible for them to have a normal diet ,  jobirova said . 
in order to improve the diets of pregnant women ,  the world bank made a <num>4</num>  $  million grant to buy groceries for <num>100,000</num>  women in khatlon oblast and sogdii oblast . 
this is not a one-day issue . 
as our country develops economically ,  these problems will gradually outlive themselves ,  jobirova said . 
the long migration home for oralmans
a nomadic kazakh family in china prepares a meal over a campfire in this file photo . 
as many as a million ethnic kazakhs have repatriated to kazakhstan from china and elsewhere under a government program . 
 [ bruce dale / national geographic / getty images ] 
almaty ,  kazakhstan -- in the morning i wake up ,  look out the window and i cannot believe that i am in kazakhstan . 
i am afraid that all these years are a dream ,  and i am still in china . 
six years ago ,  tanjaryk ,  now <num>25</num>  , moved with his parents from china to almaty under a repatriation programme for ethnic kazakhs . 
while his family had lived in china for several generations ,  they never quite fit in ,  continuing to speak kazakh as their first language . 
when the chinese government began to eliminate kazakh language schools and required fluency in chinese in order to attend college ,  the family decided to leave . 
they took advantage of the repatriation programme launched <num>18</num>  years ago . 
some <num>192,000</num>  families ,  or <num>760,000</num>  oralmans ,  as the repatriates are known ,  have taken advantage of the programme ,  now called nurly kosh  ( blessed migration )  . 
the programme reimburses relocation costs ,  and provides repatriates with money for housing and financial support . 
a percentage of seats in universities and other institutions of higher learning are set aside for the oralmans . 
the actual number of kazakhs arriving in kazakhstan is significantly higher than those cited . 
tanjaryk received a university degree in architecture - and learned russian . 
the money the government gave them helped his family build a home in the suburbs and tanjaryk now earns a living through farming . 
in <num>2009</num>  , president nursultan nazarbayev raised the number of families to <num>20,000</num>  from <num>15,000</num>  annually . 
the government has budgeted <num>17</num>  billion tenge  ( about us <num>130</num>  $  m )  for the migrants . 
i see only positive sides to the return of the oralmans , dos koshim ,  leader of the national patriotic movement ult tagdyry ,  told central asia online . 
the duty of the kazakh government is to return people who had to leave the country during the difficult years . 
thanks to the oralmans ,  said gali ,  the proportion of ethnic kazakhs in kazakhstan has grown from <num>48</num>  percent of the total population in <num>1989</num>  to about <num>67</num>  percent in <num>2009</num>  .
they also help fill the outflow of slavic and german populations abroad ,  he said . 
by <num>2009</num>  we succeeded in restoring the population to the size it had in <num>1989</num>  .
the rapid reproduction of kazakhs and the new repatriates will ensure the sustained growth of the population of kazakhstan from now on . 
a large number of ethnic slavs and germans left kazakhstan between <num>1991</num>  and <num>2000</num>  , taking advantage of repatriation programs and freedom to leave the country . 
but gali says the movement of kazakhs into and out of the country is nothing new . 
the migrational exchange of kazakhs from the near and far abroad has been continuous since the very inception of the kazakh khanate ,  said gali . 
… some left the territory in hard times and returned in times of stabilisation . 
migration is a form of existence for the kazakhs . 
but life for the repatriated oralmans is not always easy . 
they say a third of all working-age oralmans are unemployed ,  and that despite reserved spots in higher education institutions it is difficult for them to get an education . 
all families of five or more people receive about <num>833,000</num>  tenge  ( <num>5,500</num>  $  )  for housing . 
tanjaryk said his family used that money to build a foundation for a house ,  and then built the rest on their own . 
asar ,  the ancient kazakh custom of neighbours ,  friends and relatives helping build a home ,  assisted them in construction . 
i am not complaining ,  he said . 
it is enough that i am not a second-class citizen here . 
i have the ability to work and i am thankful . 
four or five years ago , … it was possible to buy a house on the money they were allocated . 
in this time of economic crisis ,  you cant even buy a bathroom . 
the authorities should commit themselves to providing the oralmans with housing ,  koshim said . 
while repatriates from post-soviet countries settle relatively easily due to similarities in mentality ,  education and knowledge of the russian language ,  it is more complicated for people from the far abroad . 
the biggest challenge for oralmans from china and mongolia ,  according to him ,  is the widespread use of the russian language in kazakhstan . 
they did not expect to face problems in their everyday lives and with employment due to this ignorance . 
some however see a problem with the inflow of the oralmans . 
if one part of kazakhstans population understands and wants to help ,  then the second  ( ethnic slavs )  is outraged that for years they have not been able to receive apartments and the oralmans will get them out of turn . 
five or six years ago local residents even picketed  ( in protest )  ,  koshim said . 
imu leader re-emerges on video
islamic movement of uzbekistan leader takhir yuldash speaks to followers in a video posted on the internet in january <num>2010</num>  .
yuldash was believed to have been killed in september <num>2009</num>  .
tashkent - the leader of the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  takhir yuldash  ( a . k . a .  takhir yuldashev )  ,  who reportedly died last september ,  has appeared in a new video released by the imu on the internet . 
on january <num>12</num>  , the german newspaper die welt published part of the <num>20</num> -minute video on its website . 
the video was found on a website used by the imu to distribute information about its activities . 
there are no limits before us . 
our goal is to take over not only afghanistan and pakistan ;  our goal is to take over the whole world and establish a caliphate as allah commanded ,  yuldash said ,  sitting among his followers . 
a caliphate is a traditional islamic form of government . 
last year ,  we lost many brothers ,  but their deaths went to a good cause . 
our main goal is the establishment of a caliphate ,  and we must sacrifice everything to reach it ,  said yuldash . 
ubaidulla uvatov ,  professor and director of the international centre imam al-bukhari in samarkand and a former official of uzbekistans state committee on religious affairs ,  said he does not give yuldashs statements much weight . 
i do not pay much attention to such statements . 
yes ,  today it became known that takhir yuldash was not killed . 
these appearances on the internet will not bring about anything . 
but ,  you cannot just call it empty talk . 
every time you hear about or see the latest series of explosions and terrorist acts from shakhids  ( suicide-bombers )  ,  your heart sinks . 
independent uzbek political analyst mekhman jabbarov said ,  the latest statements from takhir yuldash are like the eastern saying which goes :  an empty barrel makes more noise . 
this is just a pr move for takhir yuldash . 
it is a reminder that he still exists . 
thus ,  he wants to attract the attention of the world community to himself . 
and this means big funding . 
religious fanatics ,  though they call themselves fighters for a pure islam ,  are a group of unscrupulous businessmen who mine fame and money out of other peoples bones . 
they will never be able to install their regime for the simple reason that they will not be able to control it ,  noted uvatov . 
do not think of takhir yuldash as a personality . 
if he were not here ,  they would have come up with someone else . 
this all depends on the confluence of circumstances . 
if the wind starts blowing in the other direction ,  they will make a martyred freedom fighter out of him . 
in uzbekistan ,  there are almost no people left who ever believed in takhir yuldashs ideas . 
any nonconformism is severely punished . 
in the harsh-regime prisons there are separate sections for them . 
after namanganis death ,  yuldash became the head of the imu ,  which initially sought only a soft revolution in central asia . 
the analysts said the arrest of thousands of people since <num>1996</num>  who have been accused of attempting to overthrow the government led some to join the imu . 
while there are no accurate numbers of the size of the imu ,  pakistani senator ibrahim khan told the pakistani daily times newspaper in september <num>2009</num>  that some <num>5,000</num>  imu militants are hiding in north and south waziristan . 
realising that they were deceived ,  the refugees who joined takhir yuldash could not leave his camp . 
still ,  many did flee . 
the uzbek government promised amnesty . 
today ,  former imu members cannot find work and they are not allowed to leave their home kishlak  ( village )  or city ,  jabbarov said . 
kyrgyzstan struggles with rising mental health issues
two men enter the kyzyl-dzhar psychiatric hospital . 
human rights advocates say inadequate funding has led to patient abuse and a lack of treatment . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
kyzyl-dzhar - everyone has heard the horror stories . 
patients are bound to their beds for weeks . 
patients are forced to work for free . 
patients kill themselves to escape mistreatment . 
and the issue is raising enough concern that some activists have drawn up a proposed bill to ensure better care for parliament to consider . 
all the problems can be traced ,  in part ,  to inadequate funding . 
take patient restraints ,  for example . 
maria aitmurzayeva ,  the head nurse of the psychiatric hospital in kyzyl-dzhar ,  said ,  we used to use bindings . 
they are still not prohibited in cases where the patient is likely to harm himself or those around him . 
that is ,  if the patient wants to hang himself ,  we have to restrain him . 
but experts at the centre for the protection of the interests of persons with mental disorders said the use of ties in psychiatric hospitals is too common . 
a <num>14</num> -year-old patient suffering from mental retardation was committed to the chym-korgon psychiatric hospital from an orphanage about a month before our experts visited the establishment . 
human rights activists say inadequate funding means patients do not receive good treatment or sufficient doses of psychotropic medicine when needed . 
too often ,  the activists say ,  treatment consists of tying the patient to a bed and conducting talk and art therapy . 
trying to get past that approach is one reason for pushing the bill ,  which is stalled in parliament with an uncertain chance of going anywhere . 
activists cite abuse and forced labour as two big issues . 
juveniles and adults ,  regardless of sex ,  are kept in a single hospital wing ,  and the doors to their rooms do not lock . 
also ,  patients are forced to do unpaid field work for the hospital <num>10</num>  to <num>12</num>  hours a day under poor conditions . 
human rights activists have sent complaints to the ministry of health ,  which has promised to investigate ,  but the situation has not changed . 
welfare issues ,  such as poor nutrition and physical health ,  also exist . 
patients are fed four times a day ,  turdubekova said . 
those who are most debilitated are given extra food at <num>11</num>  am ;  however ,  the food is of poor quality and there isnt enough of it . 
for their late dinners ,  for example ,  the patients get bread and unsweetened tea . 
turdubekova said that during warm months patients walk around for no more than three hours per day in a small courtyard enclosed by a metal fence and lacking grass or trees . 
during the cold months ,  walking around is prohibited . 
burul makenbayeva ,  director of the mental health and society association ,  said the situation in the ak-sui womens psychoneurological boarding house in teploklyuchenka is one of the worst . 
one patient named cholpon hanged herself ,  and patients lena nuriyeva and marina dronova were found working as slaves under the head nurse of the disabled peoples home . 
earlier ,  the bones of a patient by the name of zhumagul were found in a field located near the village of cholpon ,  which is not far from the boarding house ,  makenbayeva said . 
zhumagul had died under mysterious circumstances and was buried in the field . 
human rights activists believe zhumagul killed herself because of mistreatment . 
government officials periodically inspect clinics ,  but according to human rights activists ,  violations go unreported because the inspectors are incompetent and staff members hide the evidence . 
as a solution ,  turdubekova and her colleague at the league of childrens rights defenders ,  natalya orlova ,  suggest that mentally ill kyrgyz be held in regular hospital wards rather than in isolation in special clinics . 
we need to create alternative services for the protection of patients rights . 
these could be ,  for example ,  services that are independent from the general healthcare system . 
what is important is the correct and detailed keeping of records and their availability for inspection they said . 
uzbek fighters lose public support in tribal areas
islamic movement of uzbekistan leader takhir yuldash speaks in a video posted on the internet in january <num>2010</num>  .
uzbek militants in pakistan have gained a reputation as brutal fighters . 
landi kotal ,  khyber agency - uzbeks aligned with the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  have acquired a reputation as some of the most savage militants fighting pakistani forces in the tribal regions and coalition forces in afghanistan . 
reports of their brutality have driven their popularity among residents of the region to its lowest point since their occupation of the mountainous pakistani tribal areas bordering afghanistan . 
pakistani military analysts say operations by the pakistani army and by coalition forces in afghanistan have reduced uzbek fighters numbers from about <num>4,500</num>   ( including chechens ,  tajiks and uighurs )  in <num>2007</num>  to about <num>1,000</num>  today . 
al-qaeda wanted to capture some central asian states and increase its influence in afghanistan and pakistan ,  thus paving the way for the creation of an islamic state ,  shah said . 
he said al-qaeda also wanted to capitalise on the combat skills of uzbek fighters ,  most of whom had ideological affiliations with the imu . 
khan said the uzbeks are a key element in the struggle against pakistani security forces and have enhanced the combat capability of the taliban . 
even the pakistani military officials have acknowledged this fact ,  he said . 
juma namangani was their leader when they came to afghanistan during the fight against the soviet union . 
pakistani intelligence reports said that the al-qaeda leadership in afghanistan later set up training camps for uzbek fighters and some pakistani militant  ( jihadi )  organisations at kargha ,  near kabul ,  in <num>1999</num> -<num>2000</num>  .
namangani died in a coalition air strike in afghanistans paktika province in <num>2001</num>  .
his death paved the way for takhir yuldash to take over as commander of the uzbek fighters . 
yuldash was rumoured to have been killed in <num>2009</num>  but appeared in a new video released this month . 
at first the uzbeks received a warm welcome in the tribal areas . 
residents in north and south waziristan told central asia online that taliban sympathisers gave their daughters in marriage to uzbeks ,  leased agricultural land to them and went into business with them . 
however ,  local tribal sources say that atrocities by the uzbeks led to their expulsion from south waziristan by a pro-taliban group headed by mulvi nazir in <num>2007</num>  .
the uzbeks then took shelter in north waziristan . 
there they divided into two groups ,  with yahiya muradov forming his faction of the islamic jihad union . 
another band of uzbeks made common cause with uighurs and other muslims from chinas xinjiang province under the name islamic movement of turkestan . 
the uzbeks have a reputation for beheading victims and conducting other brutalities . 
in contrast ,  militants from the tribal areas say they reject such methods . 
shah calls the uzbeks soldiers of fortune . 
he said the locals evicted the uzbeks from the region because they engaged in homosexual acts and molested new recruits . 
homosexuality is strictly prohibited by islam . 
their gruesome and barbaric acts <abbr>…</abbr>  earned them the titles of butchers and inhuman and wild creatures ,  said ali gul wazir ,  a resident of wana . 
uzbeks were considered a symbol of terror and destruction in the tribal areas ,  as they would not tolerate any opposition to their acts of brutality ,  he said ,  adding that the ahmadzai wazir were not ready to tolerate the very existence of these barbaric uzbeks on their land . 
a tribal journalist from south waziristan who requested anonymity said he fled his home after the uzbek militia ordered his death for reporting the number of uzbeks killed in fighting against local tribesmen . 
besides the uzbeks ,  the pakistan institute for peace studies in <num>2007</num>  estimated there were some <num>5,000</num>  arab fighters in the tribal areas ;  <num>3,000</num>  yemenis ;  <num>2,000</num>  egyptians ;  <num>2,800</num>  algerians ;  and <num>1,200</num>  assorted tunisians ,  iraqis ,  libyans and jordanians . 
but shamim shahid ,  a senior journalist in peshawar who specialises in afghan and tribal area issues ,  insists that new recruits are still coming from uzbekistan . 
the new recruits are mostly orphans or being kidnapped from different educational institutions in uzbekistan and then brought to pakistan via afghanistan and turkey ,  he said . 
shahid alleged that most of the top uzbek leadership have criminal records and are fugitives from their homelands justice . 
their main sources of income  ( now )  are kidnapping for ransom ,  carjacking ,  arms trading ,  transfer of money through illegal means and financial assistance from taliban and al-qaeda sympathisers in the gulf and arab countries ,  said shahid . 
tajik media said to be promoting rogun for profit
bank employees in dushanbe fill out paperwork as shares in the rogun hydroelectric power plant went on sale january <num>6</num>  .
some tajik residents are complaining about pro-rogun media coverage . 
dushanbe - tajikistan has begun building the rogun hydroelectric power station ,  but reporters shouldnt cheerleaders for the project ,  some tajiks say . 
todays newspapers resemble publications from soviet times ,  reader mustafa rakhmatov told central asia online . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  the tv talks only about rogun . 
views  [ of rogun ]  are quite different in the private press ,  he said . 
however ,  the contents of many publications related to rogun attest to how many of the mass media in this country approach the topic <abbr>…</abbr>  looking at the financial benefits for themselves if they support the governments initiatives . 
without these pr events ,  in which the mass media are playing the primary role ,  it would have been impossible to organise this large-scale sale of rogun shares ,  said parviz mullojanov ,  an independent political analyst . 
journalists who support the power stations construction have a different line . 
in their view ,  theyre protecting the country from uzbek pressure . 
uzbekistan opposes the project ,  citing concerns of the dams impact on its water supply . 
two weeks ago ,  pro-power station reporters formed the union of independent publications  ( uip )  ,  which includes the tajik-language farazh ,  sssr and nigokh . 
one of our aims is to develop a common policy to protect our national interests in the information sphere ,  particularly in defence of the construction of rogun ,  said saimiddin dustov ,  editor-in-chief of nigokh and chairman of the association . 
enough of sitting and listening to insults by galustyan  [ an actor who plays a tajik migrant worker on russian tv ]  and vladimir zhirinovsky  [ a nationalist russian politician ]  ,  said khurshed atovullo ,  editor-in-chief of farazh . 
the associations first line of defence is directed against the uzbek governments anti-rogun stance ,  said dustov . 
the union intends to open an information centre in rogun ,  and each year to publish a book chronicling progress on its construction . 
independent journalists and other journalistic associations expressed ambivalence about a journalistic organisation pushing openly for rogun . 
there have been no independent media in tajikistan for a long time ,  said an independent journalist who asked to remain anonymous . 
i can assume the union was not created without outside interference . 
for society ,  it might be better if there were no special media unions on any theme or government project ,  said abdullayev . 
mindful of such worries ,  dustov said that the associations member newspapers will publish objective ,  critical material . 
we intend to inform the public <abbr>…</abbr>  about the completion of roguns construction ,  he said . 
we intend to pursue transparent coverage . 
but critics sense a profit motive in friendly coverage of roguns construction . 
its more of an attempt to earn extra money from the concept of rogun ,  said independent journalist lidiya isamova . 
in raising funds for rogun from the population ,   [ the media ]  made many mistakes . 
newspapers that zealously supported this concept may lose readers confidence . 
she also said dustov is running for parliament while editing a newspaper . 
this is more like an attempt to demonstrate their commitment to government initiatives ,  said abdullayev . 
if  [ expected financial support from the government ]  doesnt come in the short term ,  the union of three will slowly cease to exist . 
tajik newspaper readers and tv viewers have little choice . 
on the government tv station ,  every <num>10</num>  to <num>20</num>  minutes there is a series of photos of roguns construction ,  said sologub . 
putting such pressure on people <abbr>…</abbr>  is simply wrong . 
outcast lyuli gypsies dream of a better life
widow rasida makhmudova lost her home to a fire because the village where she and other lyuli gypsies live lacks many basics . 
 [ bakyt ibraimov ] 
jany-kyshtak ,  kyrgyzstan - if you blink when you drive by ,  you might miss this border village in osh oblast . 
there is nowhere to call from if you need emergency medical attention or there is a fire . 
when the house of the widow makhmudova ,  who has nine children ,  caught fire ,  the residents couldnt put it out in time-there was no water in the irrigation ditch . 
the village is home to lyuli gypsies - many of whom are unemployed and lack the identity documents they need to get ahead in life . 
its a hard life ,  one that often goes unsupported by the government ,  even though the lyuli expected their lot to improve once kyrgyzstan gained its independence from the soviet union . 
representatives of this ethnic group who have already received passports have the right to receive social security benefits and pensions just like all citizens of kyrgyzstan ,  said venera junusova ,  press secretary for the ministry of labour and social protection of kyrgyzstan . 
bakhodir narmirzayev ,  president of the central asian organisation lyuli society ,  said ,  we do not receive real support . 
during the holidays ,  they might allot us <num>500</num>  som  ( us <num>11</num>  $  )  or a few groceries . 
we want the authorities to build a complete school in the village . 
they have made promises for seven or eight years ,  but the problem remains unresolved . 
the authorities cite a lack of money in the budget ,  yet in other osh oblast villages ,  schools are being built . 
lyuli gypsies appeared in jany-kyshtak in the <num>1950</num>  second  ,  when the soviet authorities forced them to stop their nomadic way of life and provided them small plots of land . 
but the documentation ,  which would make their lives easier ,  is hard to get . 
anara usenova ,  chief specialist of the department of social development and public health in the osh oblast ,  said getting ids is difficult . 
they are checked for criminal records and any citizenship in another country . 
requests are sent to tajikistan ,  from which they migrated in the <num>1950</num>  second  ,  but ,  as it is ,  we dont receive the complete information from there . 
as a result ,  the process of issuing passports is made more difficult . 
socially ,  the gypsies face problems ,  too . 
the health of the lyuli worries doctors . 
their basic diet is tandoori bread ,  tea ,  occasional milk products and ,  less often ,  meat . 
nd amost all of them live in mud-brick homes that do not meet hygienic standards . 
usenova said they have been offered land in remote villages of the karashu district ,  but they do not want to go there :  they are used to living in a closed community . 
although some of the problems stem from their way of life ,  the lack of government attention doesnt help . 
london conference pledges to rebuild afghanistan ,  accepts karzais reintegration plan
afghan president hamid karzai and british prime minister gordon brown greet london conference attendees . 
the london conference on the future of afghanistan accepted karzais plan to reintegrate taliban militants into society . 
 [ pakhtoon shinwari ] 
london - the london conference on the future of afghanistan pledged to maintain the international communitys long-term commitment to rebuild the war-torn country and to support proposals by afghan president harmid karzai to start reconciliation and reintegration in afghanistan . 
a key conference decision was to support a special fund to offer jobs and resettlement to taliban fighters not associated with al-qaeda who wish to lay down their arms . 
japan has already announced that it will donate us <num>1950</num>  second  toward the account . 
speaking at the conference ,  karzai urged the international community to help his government reintegrate all afghans ,  including taliban fighters . 
karzai specifically urged saudi king abdullah and afghanistans neighbours to come forward and play a role in the establishment of peace and normalcy in the war-torn country . 
conference attendees included british prime minister gordon brown ,  un secretary general ban ki-moon ,  us secretary of state hillary clinton ,  pakistani foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and representatives from some <num>70</num>  other nations . 
iran boycotted the conference ,  saying the aim of the conference organizers was not reconciliation ,  but to send more troops to afghanistan . 
toward that end ,  he promised to establish a national council for peace ,  reconciliation and reintegration and to call a peace jirga - a traditional afghan gathering of tribal leaders . 
we ask all neighbours ,  particularly pakistan ,  to support our peace and reconciliation endeavours ,  said karzai . 
the afghan president said though the world has already paid due attention to unemployment ,  education ,  health ,  and agriculture in afghanistan ,  <num>80</num>  percent of international aid still ends up in the wrong hands . 
conferees agreed with karzais proposal to better coordinate international aid and channel it increasingly through the afghan government . 
to make this possible ,  karzai pledged reforms to improve budgeting and government structures . 
brown ,  whose government organized and hosted the conference ,  said the london conference marked the beginning of the transition process . 
by the middle of next year ,  we have to turn the tide in the fight against the insurgency ,  he said . 
pledging support for the expansion of the afghan security forces ,  brown said the international community would agree that the afghan national army will number <num>134,000</num>  by october <num>2010</num>  , and <num>171,600</num>  by october <num>2011</num>  .
and similarly today ,  we will commit to supporting a police reform plan ,  with afghan national police numbers reaching <num>109,000</num>  by october this year ,  and <num>134,000</num>  by october <num>2011</num>  , brown tells the conference . 
karzai said the goal of his government is to increasingly take the lead for afghan security ,  with the kabul government responsible for securing currently hostile areas within three years ,  and taking responsibility for maintaining security in those areas in five years . 
ki-moon said at the conference that afghanistan was never alone in its fight against terrorism and that the un would play its role to help establish peace in the region . 
he supported the plan set out by karzai regarding reaching out to all afghans to re-establish peace in the country . 
another conference in scheduled for kabul later this year . 
tajikistan raises electricity rates
dushanbe retiree gurgak mirzoyev ,  <num>76</num>  , pays his electricity bill . 
complaints about electricity rates are increasing as quickly the price per kwh . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe ,  tajikistan- beginning january <num>1</num>  , electricity rates in tajikistan increased <num>20</num>  percent . 
after the value-added tax ,  every kwh costs <num>0.09</num>  som  ( us <num>0.02</num>  $  )  . 
previously ,  the rate had been <num>0.075</num>  som  ( us <num>0.017</num>  $  )  . 
i used almost <num>40</num>  som  ( us <num>9</num>  $  )  . 
this is from december <num>17</num>  , when they installed new metres . 
they whirl around so much . 
you know ,  i do not even have a refrigerator at home ,  not to mention other luxuries . 
with the new rate ,  i will probably have to pay my whole pension ,  said mirzoyev . 
mirzoyev lives alone . 
he receives a pension of <num>77</num>  som  ( us <num>17.60</num>  $  usd )  ,  <num>17</num>  som above the minimum pension of <num>60</num>  som . 
i have been on a pension since <num>94</num>  .
then ,  they set the entire amount of the pension at <num>24,000</num>  wooden rubles ,  he said ,  referring to the then-worthless currency . 
whether you worked a day or <num>40</num>  years ,  they made it the same for everyone . 
now ,  with the conversion to the new money ,  i come out with so little . 
you know ,  i worked as a paramedic for <num>45</num>  years . 
i would run into the mountains and treat patients . 
rashid gulov ,  head engineer at tajikistans state energy holding company barki tochik ,  told central asia online ,  presently ,  payment collection for electrical consumption amounts to <num>80</num>  to <num>85</num>  percent  ( of actual usage )  ,  with businesses being at around <num>95</num>  percent . 
the most persistent non-payers are mostly wealthy people . 
in order to heat a two-storey house or heat a large swimming pool ,  you need enough electricity for an entire city block . 
but poor people are trying to pay it all right away ,  economist khojimukhammad umarov told central asia online . 
in tajikistan ,  electrical bills are collected door-to-door . 
such a medieval way of collecting payments leads to big debts . 
his view is that tajikistan will be more attractive to foreign investors if rates stay low ,  especially for industry . 
gulov said barki tochik is close to become self-sufficient . 
in june of this year ,  it is most likely that after the next increase the rates on average will be <num>13</num>  dirams in the country . 
one bone of contention for umarov are rates charged for industry ,  especially the tajik aluminium company  ( talco )  ,  the countrys primary electricity consumer ,  and for irrigation pumping stations . 
i think our authorities are losing the ability to respect limits . 
and according to my calculations ,  we do not need <num>13</num>  for rogun now . 
they say that these funds are necessary to purchase two turbines ,  but the turbines will not be installed for another five or even ten years . 
the peoples money will most likely go to other projects ,  said umarov . 
he would not specify which projects . 
in an effort to cut electricity usage ,  tajikistan imposed a ban on the import of incandescent bulbs last august ,  and later banned their sale . 
according to his data ,  over the past six months ,  <num>8.1</num>  meter  energy-saving bulbs were distributed to the population ,  resulting in <num>5.2</num>  meter  fewer kwh being used on lighting daily . 
but tarabova and mirsoyev see things differently . 
they brought three bulbs to a poor ,  lonely old man . 
they already burned out . 
i screwed in the old ones out of my own reserves ,  mirsoyev said . 
arrests of banned religious organisations supporters increasing
muslims pray in kyrgyzstan in this file photo . 
the kyrgyz government has cracked down on religious groups ,  notably the hizb ut-tahrir movement . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
government officials say radical islamists present a threat . 
the situation in the sphere of religion in kyrgyzstan is explosive and requires the immediate adoption of appropriate measures and the mobilisation of the public ,  deputy chairman of the state committee for national security rustam mamasadykov said in october <num>2009</num>  .
the worsening of relations between islamic faithful and the government began in <num>2008</num>  , when authorities in nookat refused permission for a public celebration of eid al fitr ,  the end of ramadan . 
protesters tried to seize the district administration building ,  and the government arrested and convicted more than <num>30</num>  people ,  including women and children . 
authorities have focused on the banned hizb ut-tahrir movement ,  which organized this and other protests . 
in kyrgyzstan ,  the politicisation of islam is a fact ,  independent political analyst murat kazakov told central asia online . 
recently ,  the countrys muslim community has been increasingly drawn into domestic political processes ,  becoming the object of the authorities intense attention . 
in october <num>2009</num>  , at a meeting of the ruling ak-jol party ,  parliamentary deputy alisher sabirov said ,  just putting these hizb ut-tahrir supporters in prison is dangerous :  out of their union with the prisoners ,  we could get an explosive mixture that would be difficult to control . 
in many prisons ,  there are already mosques . 
this is precisely why the principal work needs to be done in the ideological mainstream . 
religious expert kadyr malikov said hizb ut-tahrir is gaining support among prison inmates ,  but the destruction of records means no numbers are available . 
as for why its members keep going to prison ,  abdumalik sharipov ,  an expert on ethno-religious issues at the human rights organisation spravedlivost ,  said ,  the police and special services <abbr>…</abbr>  do not know how to fight  ( hizb ut-tahrir )  supporters . 
arrest is the only weapon they know . 
but members of hizb ut-tahrir say they are no threat to peace . 
we do not kill anyone and we do not call for violence . 
our crux lies in peaceful change ,  said bakyt ,  a believer . 
sharipov agreed . 
its members call for the establishment of a caliphate-but by peaceful means ,  he said . 
there are known cases ,  it is true ,  when not only religious literature ,  but also weapons and drugs ,  were found during the arrests of party members . 
in reality ,  these people are against all of this . 
the police have to present them as fervid enemies of society ,  as very dangerous enemies . 
all these bullets and guns and this heroin are simply planted by the police officers themselves during the search so they can be put in prison for a long time ,  whereas the term for the possession of literature of an extremist nature would be small ,  he alleged . 
according to the ministry of internal affairs press service ,  in <num>2009</num>  police seized about <num>14,000</num>  copies of printed materials and more than <num>2,000</num>  electronic media devices with religious literature of an extremist nature from representatives of religious movements . 
in addition ,  they seized <num>13</num>  firearms ,  three grenades and <num>40</num>  detonators . 
the ministry did not explain how police found the weapons . 
knyazev said poverty ,  unemployment and social insecurity have led people to turn away from the government and toward religious propagandists ,  who tell them that only religion can give them true freedom and prosperity . 
political analyst murat suyunbayev said the reason for hizb ut-tahrirs popularity among the dispossessed is that supporters offer a version of social justice in the form of the caliphate they want to create in central asia . 
the believers sense of social responsibility is very high . 
banned religious organisations propagandists are focused primarily on this in recruiting new members ,  exploiting the weakness of representatives of official islam ,  said suyunbayev . 
suyunbayev said that among kyrgyz the position of religious radicals is not that strong . 
a member of hizb ut-tahrir ,  who declined to give his real name even though he has openly declared his membership in the party ,  said in a telephone interview from russia ,  where he now lives and works ,  if only this were just about me ! 
but now some of my acquaintances are being arrested just because they know me ,  and this means ,  according to the police ,  that they also belong to hizb ut-tahrir . 
it happens that under the pretext of fighting extremism ,  people who are not connected to underground religious organisations are arrested - those who are undesirable to the authorities and  [ in the authorities view ]  need to be isolated ,  said sharipov . 
this is also a way to <abbr>…</abbr>  show the world the danger of radical religious organisations and to justify the methods of controlling them ,  including the violation of human rights ,  he said . 
tajikistan pulls strings to rally interest in flagging puppet theatre
chkalovsk puppet theatre actors nodira akhmedova and anna serebryakova prepare to perform a play called plant a friendship tree . 
 [ maks maksudov ] 
chkalovsk - the puppets are coming . 
the tajik ministry of culture has announced that ,  from april <num>15</num> -<num>22</num>  , dushanbe will host the second international festival of puppet theatre . 
kyrgyzstan ,  uzbekistan ,  ukraine ,  belarus ,  russia ,  azerbaijan and iran will send retinues to compare style ,  share techniques ,  and perform for each other . 
… presently ,  one thing is clear :  it wont be easy for puppet theatres in central asia without government support ,  a ministry source said . 
in the 20t century ,  central asian theatres received government support ,  including salaries and buildings . 
private theatres eventually appeared . 
kazakhstan has nine large puppet theatres ,  some of which are private ;  one is christian . 
uzbekistan has ten ,  all state-owned . 
kyrgyzstan and tajikistan both have two state-run theatres ,  with tajikistans in dushanbe and chkalovsk . 
according to the ministry of culture in dushanbe ,  the country has no private theatres . 
the director of the state puppet theatre in chkalovsk ,  abduvali maksudov ,  said five years ago his company created an in-house studio to attract talented youngsters . 
in dushanbe ,  the capital ,  the salaries are about <num>30</num>  %  higher . 
according to official figures ,  the average monthly pay in northern tajikistan is <num>167.1</num>  somoni  ( us$38 . 80 )  . 
nodira akhmedova ,  who has acted at the puppet theatre in chkalovsk for <num>15</num>  years said ,  artists  ( with families )  have to combine their work at the theatre and another job in order to earn more . 
the special nature of our work is such that we have no time to look for work elsewhere . 
five months out of the year ,  we are touring and the rest of the time we are rehearsing and staging new performances ,  said anvar mansurkhojayev ,  an actor at the chkalovsk theatre . 
according to information from the theatres finance department ,  in <num>2010</num>  the theatre will receive <num>242,000</num>  tjs  ( us$58 , 068 )  from the government . 
most of that will pay workers salaries and taxes . 
the income from ticket sales is small ;  in <num>2009</num>  , the theatre took in <num>7,700</num>  tjs  ( us$1 , 790 )  . 
ibragimov said his theatre advertises on tv ,  where great shows are promised to lure spectators . 
but actors said spectators dont come upon their own . 
grandfathers and grandmothers bring in their grandchildren ,  and while the theatre seats <num>200</num>  , only <num>10</num>  to <num>20</num>  viewers come to each performance . 
presently ,  we have only two young actors ,  and they do not have professional training ,  but they are talented and speak russian and tajik ,  said abduvali maksudov ,  chkalovsk puppet theatre director . 
it would be nice to have an annual quota for students to go study for free <abbr>…</abbr>  where they train theatre enthusiasts . 
maksudov said that because chkalovsk is small ,  practically the entire child population of the city watches the theatres performances . 
therefore ,  the company often tours the countrys kindergartens and schools . 
at least one of the khujand children loves the puppet theatre . 
at one kindergarten in khujand ,  the senior teacher ,  who asked not to be named ,  said puppet theatre can be an effective teaching tool . 
the actors come themselves ,  so its easy . 
otherwise ,  the children would have to be brought to the theatre ,  which is problematic and requires additional expenses ,  the teacher said . 
children are very smart these days . 
after the performance ,  we discuss with them what they saw . 
they distinguish good from evil without fault ,  which means the purpose <abbr>…</abbr>  has been achieved . 
kazakhstan to cut corporate tax ,  impose luxury property tax
a middle-income kazakh family stands in front of their apartment complex in almaty . 
 ( getty images ) 
the kazakh government is overhauling its tax system in a bid to boost business activity . 
corporate income tax is currently <num>30</num>  percent . 
we used to have a progressive scale of personal income tax ,  but then we made it flat . 
we are now making the social tax flat ,  and propose that it should stand at <num>11</num>  percent ,  he said . 
maria disenova ,  an analyst at the almaty-based institute for economic strategies-central asia ,  believes that the government intends to simplify the tax system in order to boost economic activity in the country after kazakhstans construction and banking sectors were badly hit by the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  subprime mortgage crisis last year . 
i think that corporate income tax is being cut and a flat rate of social tax is being adopted to reduce the tax burden on business ,  especially small and medium-sized businesses ,  and stimulate business activity in the country ,  disenova said . 
another innovation of the new tax code will be a luxury tax on expensive property . 
we think that the rate of property tax on expensive property should be increased ,  prime minister masimov said . 
i believe it is fair because it is a common practice in the world . 
if you are rich and can afford expensive property ,  then you pay the appropriate tax ,  the prime minister added . 
property worth over <num>250,000</num>  $   [ usd ]  is expected to be taxed at <num>2</num>  percent from <num>2009</num>  .
disenova said that this was being done to eliminate speculation in the market ,  which had driven up property prices before the market crashed last summer ,  and to force well-off people to pay higher property taxes . 
meanwhile omarkhan oksikbayev ,  chairman of the audit committee ,  has suggested that in order to increase budget revenue the government should adopt a provision in the new tax code that will abolish tax regimes fixed in mining companies contracts . 
we think that it is necessary in the new tax code to abolish the stability of contracts signed earlier and replace taxation fixed in mining contracts with new tax legislation ,  oksikbayev told a seminar on the tax system in astana on july <num>25</num>  .
in this respect the audit committee has drafted a number of proposals and sent them to the government to consider taking into account in the new tax code ,  he said . 
water begins filling koksarai reservoir
shymkent ,  kazakhstan - test filling of the koksarai reservoir in the south kazakhstan oblast began february <num>10</num>  .
construction of the koksarai reservoir began in <num>2008</num>  to end winter flooding of the syrdarya river basin and to provide summer irrigation water . 
kyzylordinsk oblast deputies oppose construction of the reservoir ,  saying it will suck dry the syrdarya in the kyzylorda region and block the rivers flow into the aral sea . 
opponents also cite destruction of historical and archaeological sites . 
project planners had envisioned spending <num>1.5</num>  billion tenge  ( us <num>1.5</num>  )  to preserve historic sites in the area to be flooded . 
because of the economic crisis in <num>2009</num>  , planners reduced that funding . 
according to alexander grishchenko ,  director of history and culture for the southern kazakh oblast ,  eleven historical-archaeological monuments <abbr>…</abbr>  from the 5th to the 15t century ad stand in the area to be flooded . 
they include graves and ancient settlement sites . 
according to a press release from the ministry of emergency situations ,  the reservoirs surface area will be <num>466</num>  square km ,  and in <num>2008</num>  was estimated to cost about <num>43</num>  billion tenge  ( us <num>43</num>  )  . 
pakistan confirms mullah baradars arrest
the place of the arrest and operational details cannot be released due to security reasons ,  abbas said in the message . 
this admission is the first public confirmation made by the pakistani army regarding the arrest of mullah baradar . 
news media reported sunday that a joint pakistani-us operation in karachi had scooped up baradar some days earlier . 
mullah baradar ,  though second in command to mullah omar ,  was the de facto leader of taliban fighters in afghanistan . 
he was one of the founding members of the taliban militia . 
initially ,  pakistani interior minister rehman malik and afghan taliban spokesman yousuf ahmadi denied the news of mullah baradars arrest . 
malik termed the report propaganda ,  while ahmadi told afp it is a big lie . 
senior journalist zahid hussain ,  author of frontline pakistan - the struggle with militant islam ,  called the arrest of mullah baradar a setback for the taliban . 
according to hussain ,  in the past the militia had lost other important commanders ,  such as -- mullah dadullah ,  mullah akhter usmani and mullah obaidullah . 
those losses did not impact the movement for long ,  he said . 
personally ,  i believe the taliban will overcome this trauma ,  since except mullah omar ,  nobody else matters that much . 
it is primarily an ideological movement ,  said hussain . 
the taliban have a replacement for every person killed or arrested ,  said yusufzai . 
i believe they  [ the taliban ]  would have already appointed mullah baradars replacement by now . 
yusufzai said the arrest would affect taliban co-ordination ,  planning and strategy at a crucial time when afghan and nato forces have launched an offensive against the militia stronghold in helmand . 
mullah baradar was the most trusted lieutenant of mullah omar -- supreme leader of the militia -- and one of the <num>30</num>  men considered founders of the taliban movement ,  yusufzai said by phone from peshawar . 
senior awami national party  ( anp )  politician hashim baber said that since mullah baradar was the movements de facto commander ,  his arrest definitely will hamstring its activities . 
the time of the arrest is also very crucial against the backdrop of the helmand operation jointly launched by the afghan forces and nato against the militia stronghold of marjah "  ,  babar told central asia online by phone . 
he added the arrest could help the coalition in another way - by demoralising militia fighters . 
taking him off the battlefield will disrupt his comrades' co-ordination and planning at a crucial time ,  babar said . 
alleged islamic movement of uzbekistan members sit in a courtroom defendants cell as charges against them are read in this file photo . 
convictions of imu members are on the rise in tajikistan ,  raising concerns of increased extremism there . 
dushanbe - after more than <num>10</num>  years of peace after a bloody civil war between secular and islamic forces ,  convictions for belonging to extremist groups in tajikistan might signal that not all is as peaceful as it seems . 
in northern tajikistan ,  the sogd oblast court convicted four members of the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  ,  including an 11th-grader ,  february <num>16</num>  .
they received sentences of <num>15</num> -<num>30</num>  years in prison . 
according to makhmadullo asadulloyev ,  spokesman for the tajik interior ministry ,  in <num>2009</num>  the republic arrested <num>25</num>  alleged members of the imu ,  charging them with <num>28</num>  serious crimes ,  including murder ,  terrorism and drug trafficking . 
among the arrested were very many citizens of uzbekistan ,  he said . 
however ,  after sentencing ,  they cannot be extradited to <abbr>…</abbr>  their homeland ,  since there is no relevant agreement between tajikistan and uzbekistan . 
… they are not usually extremists ;  many of them are trying to hide from political persecution at home . 
despite the arrests ,  asadulloyev said that there is not a single concrete fact to indicate imu activities in tajikistan . 
all the facts that have come to light are connected only with the illegal crossing of state borders and the illegal possession of weapons ,  he said . 
the imu label is very frequently pinned on those who break the law ,  tajik senator khoji akhbar turajonzoda ,  a spiritual and political leader ,  told central asia online . 
after all ,  a lot of funding is allocated to the special services for the fight against terrorism and extremism ,  and to justify it ,  it is necessary to catch members of such groups like the imu or hizb ut-tahrir . 
at the beginning of the <num>1992</num> -<num>1997</num>  civil war ,  turajonzoda was considered the leader of the tajik islamists ,  but as soon as control over the country was lost ,  his influence waned . 
commanders from the united tajik opposition  ( uto )  gained predominance . 
turajonzoda remembers that during the civil war ferghana valley natives dissatisfied with uzbek authorities joined the uto . 
among them was jumaboi khojayev ,  better known as juma namangani ,  the present-day imu military leader . 
he was a close ally of tajik field commander mirzo ziyoyev ,  also known as mirzo jaga . 
at the time ,  there still was no talk about the creation of the imu ,  said turajonzoda . 
in <num>1993</num>  , the uto commanders and their uzbek allies went to afghanistan . 
while in afghanistan ,  they underwent special training in mujahedeen training camps . 
only after signing the general peace agreement in <num>1997</num>  , when the tajik commanders began to return to their homeland ,  did namangani and tokhir yuldashev come out against this . 
some of our guys remained with them . 
a representative of the special services ,  who wanted to remain anonymous ,  said that in june <num>2009</num>  members of the imu attempted to win over ziyoyev to their cause . 
after the civil war ,  according to the <num>30</num>  % -quota peace agreement  [ wherein the opposition was to take <num>30</num>  %  of governmental positions ]  ,  ziyoyev … was appointed minister of emergency situations and civil defence ,  said the source . 
suddenly removing him from his post and barring him outright from the government was a big mistake . 
how mirzo jaga would have behaved in the future is unknown ;  he was killed in a special services operation ,  the special services officer said . 
according to fakhriddin kholbek ,  a tajik journalist who long worked in afghanistan ,  the imu members who penetrated tajikistan had not prepared for action . 
their main task was to gather as many followers as possible from tajikistan ,  who would then be transferred to pakistan ,  he said . 
having gone through military training there ,  they would have returned to tajikistan already better trained and equipped . 
then we would have known the full power of the imu . 
the representative of tajik special services disagreed ,  saying the imu has divided into three parts :  the first is under someone named yahyo ;  the second is under the leadership of tajik native and close taliban collaborator ,  abdurakhmon ;  and the third is directly involved in subversive activities under the lead of tohir yuldashev . 
in his opinion ,  the imu is responsible for the latest developments in urumqi  ( in chinas restive xinjiang region )  ,  and is receiving help from other countries intelligence agencies . 
tajik special services express certainty that no large imu group exists in tajikistan or any other central asian country . 
there are small scattered groups in ferghana valley ,  said the tajik intelligence officer . 
they now do ideological work ,  hiding under the banner of other religious groups . 
but they do have very many sympathisers there . 
according to him ,  their purpose there is drug trafficking ,  a main source of terrorist groups funding . 
were it not for their associates in the special services ,  members of the imu could not avoid accountability for so long ,  agreed the tajik intelligence officer . 
this group can find new supporters right in tajikistan ,  said kholbek . 
while there is still no evidence that salafists are pouring into this terrorist organisation ,  this cannot be ruled out . 
he said that the direction religious extremism and terrorism take in central asia depends on the situation in afghanistan . 
if the western model will be established in afghanistan - at least for a time - then religious upsurges will decline ,  he said . 
otherwise ,  in four to five years ,  we will run into more powerful attacks by these groups . 
kyrgyzstan still owes uzbekistan for gas
as kyrgyzstan encounters problems paying for imported uzbeki gas ,  people are turning to coal and wood to heat their homes and cook . 
osh - kyrgyzstans gas debt to uzbekistan is igniting heating and cooking problems . 
ziyakhiddin musakov ,  a taxi driver and father of four from osh ,  complained that his family huddles into one room of their big house to save money . 
there is only a regular oven in one of the rooms ,  and we heat it with coal and firewood . 
whats more ,  the cost of gas doubled during this very cold winter . 
we could have heated  [ the home ]  with electric heaters ,  but this year the price of electricity doubled . 
i estimate that coal and firewood cost about a third as much . 
of course ,  gas and electricity are more convenient ,  but what do you do ? 
jalalbek ,  a retiree from batken ,  said ,  they shut our gas off at the beginning of february . 
now we use coal for heating . 
but that got more expensive too . 
osh cafe owner gulnara raimberdiyeva said the loss of gas service is costing her customers . 
we cook the food on gas ,  and now there is none ,  she said . 
so i bought an electric stove ,  but the price of electricity doubled with the new year . 
in a while ,  well be counting our costs ,  and i am afraid they will be so high we have to close the cafe . 
according to kyrgyzgaz press secretary aizada toigonbayeva ,  the ministry of energy and the ministry of finance - not kyrgyzgaz -- set this years gas rate . 
however ,  the committee kept consumer prices the same as last years :  <num>13</num>  kgs  ( us <num>0.30</num>  $  )  / cubic metre . 
the committee attributed its failure to cut the price to the appreciation of the dollars exchange rate . 
kyrgyz ministry of energy press secretary tatyana ankudovich said ,  besides the procurement cost ,  maintenance costs ,  staff salaries and other operating expenses go into the set price . 
at the beginning of february ,  deputy minister of energy kubanychbek jusupov appealed to parliament to consider including subsidies in the state budget to cover kyrgyzgazs losses . 
the deputy minister argued that at the current price ,  the companys losses amounted to <num>270</num>  meter  kgs  ( us <num>270</num>  meter  )  in <num>2009</num>  .
the gas-handling facilities and the local authorities are making every effort to collect debts ,  she said . 
jalal-abad oblast department of transportation and communication director azhimat isayev said the gas debt for his oblast was nearly <num>65</num>  meter  kgs  ( us <num>65</num>  meter  )  . 
musakov said if the government raises the price of gas ,  it will put its citizens in a hopeless situation . 
i will have to devote everything i earn to paying for gas and electricity ,  he said . 
probably ,  i will save up ,  give up on gas and buy a stove . 
next fall and winter ,  i will heat the house and cook food on firewood and coal . 
this is much cheaper ,  though not exactly convenient . 
when asked how the country could pay back the rest ,  neither the ministry of finance nor the ministry of energy had a response .

marjah - the afghan government installed an administrator and raised the national flag over marjah in a ceremony february <num>25</num>  that demonstrated significant progress in the battle to displace taliban militants . 
even as afghan and international forces continued to disarm bombs and mines and ferret out taliban fighters ,  local residents have been returning to the area in helmand province .

pakistan to return baradar to afghanistan after extradition treaty
by hasan khan
islamabad - pakistan has agreed in principle to hand over the afghan talibans second-in-command ,  mullah abdul ghani baradar akhund ,  once an extradition treaty is signed . 
the government of pakistan has accepted afghanistans proposal for extraditing mullah baradar and other taliban who are in its custody and showed readiness to hand over those prisoners on the basis of an agreement between the two countries ,  said a statement issued by afghan president hamid karzais office in kabul . 
pakistani intelligence officials arrested mullah baradar ,  considered to be a trusted colleague of afghan taliban supreme leader mullah muhammad omar ,  two weeks ago by pakistani intelligence officials in karachi . 
media reports said coalition officials helped pakistani authorities nab him . 
a senior official of the afghan embassy in islamabad ,  not authorised to talk on the record ,  told central asia online that the visit of afghanistans interior minister was quickly planned after pakistan interior minister rehman malik said he expected a formal request to hand over mullah baradar . 
getting mullah baradar was the main mission of  ( afghan interior minister )  hanif atmars visit to islamabad ,  the official said . 
pakistan interior minister rehman malik told media representatives that talks were under way between kabul and islamabad to finalise a deal on the exchange of prisoners . 
pakistan has asked afghanistan to hand over <num>28</num>  prisoners ,  the afghan diplomat said ,  and kabul has provided pakistan a list of <num>38</num>  fugitives it is seeking . 
 ( the interior ministers )  are going to meet in kabul again soon for finalising an agreement on the exchange of prisoners ,  the diplomat said . 
he expressed hope that negotiators would sign a draft extradition treaty between pakistan and afghanistan at their next meeting . 
news media report that some <num>15</num>  key taliban commanders nabbed in recent weeks are in pakistans custody . 
uzbek fighters remain an unknown quantity in pakistan
suspected uzbek militants are led handcuffed past media representatives following their arrest by security forces at kohat in pakistans north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  in this <num>2008</num>  file photo .

peshawar ,  pakistan - over the years ,  uzbek militants have earned a reputation for ferocity and fanaticism . 
those kidnapped by them tell harrowing tales of brutality . 
information about uzbek militants hiding in pakistans tribal areas is so sketchy that authorities still have not confirmed whether islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  leader tahir yuldashev was killed several months ago in an airstrike in south waziristan . 
the attack that may have killed yuldashev ,  <num>43</num>  , took place august <num>27</num>  , exactly <num>22</num>  days after a similar strike killed baitullah mehsud ,  founder of the outlawed tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  in south waziristan . 
pakistani security officials said in october that yuldashev ,  commonly referred to as qari farooq by militants ,  died in the august attack . 
however ,  tribal sources in south waziristan said at the time that yuldashev and pakistani taliban commander noor islam were injured . 
even the number of uzbek militants operating in the border region of afghanistan and pakistan isnt known . 
sirajiddin tolibov of the bbcs uzbek service ,  in an october <num>2009</num>  article ,  said estimates of uzbek militants in pakistan range from <num>500</num>  to <num>5,000</num>  .
pakistans military and security officials put their number at between several hundred to a few thousand . 
tribal sources in south and north waziristan - the two places where the uzbeks mostly reside - believe they number about <num>500</num>  to <num>600</num>  .
the uzbek fighters are known to have often joined with local militants to eliminate tribal elders in south and north waziristan ,  bajaur and other tribal areas in a bid to overcome opposition to taliban control and to send a stark message that pro-government and anti-taliban tribesmen would meet the same fate . 
figures vary ,  but a few hundred tribal chiefs have been killed and the remaining stay silent as part of this strategy . 
but not all have tolerated the uzbeks . 
the ahmadzai wazir tribe of south waziristan ,  once partners with the imu ,  lost patience with them . 
under pakistani taliban commander maulvi nazeer ,  a lashkar  ( armed tribal force )  arose to expel the uzbek militants . 
pakistans security forces assisted nazeers men with arms and money ,  and the uzbeks were forced to shift to parts of south waziristan region inhabited by the mehsud tribe . 
some uzbeks sought refuge in the mir ali area of north waziristan ,  where uzbek families were staying under the protection of pakistani tribal militants . 
subsequently ,  reports emerged from mir ali that the local population wanted the uzbeks to leave but could not force them out . 
area tribesmen complained that the uzbek militants posed a threat to the communities that refused to take orders from them . 
a cleric from kaniguram village in south waziristan ,  speaking on condition of anonymity ,  recalled that before the offensive by pakistans security forces in october <num>2009</num>  , a number of uzbeks were living in his neighbourhood . 
they were told not to come to the local mosque ,  as doing so would make the mosque a target for those hunting militants . 
a crackdown by the karimov government forced imu cadres to flee and seek refuge outside uzbekistan in the mid-1990s . 
by august <num>1998</num>  , when the taliban were in control of more than <num>90</num>  %  of afghanistan ,  the imu established military camps in that countrys northern provinces . 
the imu suffered losses in afghanistan in december <num>2001</num>  .
its leader ,  juma namangani ,  a former soviet paratrooper who had fought against the afghan mujahedeen as part of the soviet occupation of afghanistan from <num>1987</num> -<num>89</num>  , was reportedly killed . 
yuldashev replaced him ,  and under his leadership ,  the uzbeks found sanctuaries in pakistans tribal areas after the collapse of the taliban regime . 
fleeing afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime ,  in early <num>2002</num>  , uzbeks and militants from several other countries started taking refuge in the pakistan border regions . 
locals say the uzbeks did not live quietly among the pashtun tribes ,  unlike the arab nationals . 
locals complain that the uzbeks tried to impose themselves on their hosts and used force against anyone critical of them . 
the uzbeks were accused of kidnapping and killing tribal elders and introducing beheadings and other forms of torture to the area . 
the imus use of violence as a creed could be one reason for putting off potential recruits . 
the inability of the group to operate in uzbekistan due to the tough security measures adopted by the karimov government has also limited its capacity to interact with the people and attract recruits . 
it tried to expand its scope by renaming itself the islamic party of turkestan in june <num>2001</num>  and welcoming other central asians to its ranks . 
however ,  it appears that the imus capacity to serve as an islamic alternative to the karimov regime has diminished . 
rahimullah yusufzai is a peshawar-based journalist . 
he is resident editor of the english daily the news international in peshawar and senior analyst for geo tv . 
he is also the correspondent for bbcs pushto and urdu services in the north-west frontier province . 
an expert on afghan affairs and the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  of pakistan ,  he has interviewed osama bin laden and taliban leader mulla mohammad omar . 
corruption threatens kyrgyz educational system
students walk to classes at bishkeks kyrgyz-russian slavonic university . 
educational corruption is said to be increasing in the country despite the governments efforts . 
 [ aibek karabaev ] 
bishkek - until the mid-1970s ,  nobody could imagine corruption in education . 
the soviet state guaranteed a higher education for anyone with good grades . 
but over time ,  and especially since the collapse of the soviet union ,  that changed . 
today ,  corruption starts right at the universitys threshold - in the entrance exams ,  said kyrgyz deputy education minister boris kubaev ,  who worked for almost <num>40</num>  years in the national university of kyrgyzstan . 
in the last <num>30</num>  or <num>40</num>  years ,  nothing has changed . 
viacheslav has been an undergraduate for nearly ten years ,  taking leaves of absence and switching to different departments . 
in his words ,  he finds it advantageous to be an undergraduate . 
they did it in different ways . 
… if someone was having problems with exams or quizzes ,  he would immediately turn to me . 
i know all the rates ;  id go to the teacher ,  hand over the quiz paper and the money ,  and he would assign a grade . 
kubaev said the main problem is not that teachers are interested in receiving bribes ,  but that so many students are willing to give them . 
in soviet times ,  when corruption had just begun to appear ,   ( the authorities )  would aggressively cut it off at every instance ,  he said . 
you could be fired if you even came under suspicion - evidence of guilt wasnt even necessary much of the time . 
but you have to understand its impossible to solve every problem with a single stroke ,  he said . 
a survey of undergraduates showed that the more prestigious the university ,  the higher the price of a good grade . 
however ,  that price seldom exceeds 1 , 000kgs  ( us <num>22</num>  $  )  . 
maxim is studying to be a computer programmer . 
he said he rarely resorts to corruption ,  but that sometimes its unavoidable . 
he said the price of the grade depends on whether its in ones major . 
adylbek sharshenbaev ,  a member of ti kyrgyzstans board of directors ,  cited several reasons for the high level of corruption . 
alexander katsev ,  a professor and a member of the russian academy of pedagogical and social sciences ,  has his own theory . 
he said corruption is rooted in a system that devotes the first two years of undergraduate study to strengthening knowledge of secondary school subjects and general development . 
to eliminate the long-standing problem of corruption in university entrance exams ,  the kyrgyz government introduced the all republic testing  ( ort )  program in <num>2002</num>  .
two other exams also exist :  a test used by a number of former-soviet countries and subject entrance exams . 
the ort has been used since <num>2002</num>  .
since <num>2006</num>  the centre for educational assessment and teaching has administered the exam . 
centre director inna valkova said the ort system is clean . 
 [ we ]  record all the nat questions on a cd . 
we lock it up in a bank vault in the presence of journalists and parents . 
only afterward can test developers prepare the correct answers . 
nobody can sell them ,  she said . 
any parent can ask for his childs answer sheet after he shows officials a certificate proving that his child passed the exam . 
people are  [ constantly ]  checking themselves and keeping track . 
the process doesnt have any loopholes . 
the countrys high-school graduates all take the same exam . 
those with the best results - about <num>200</num>  - out of <num>35,000</num>  each year - can enter any university they want for free . 
if they do well ,  they can even draw a monthly stipend of 300kgs  ( us <num>6.50</num>  $  )  during college . 
sometimes the student has a high test score ,  but the universities dont accept him ,  said valkova . 
then he can attend by paying tuition ,  bypassing the exam requirement ,  but he will not get a stipend in that case . 
she said those who want to attend university for free but didnt score high enough on the  ( ort )  have to pass the conventional entrance exams . 
while minister of education and science abdilda musaev praised the ort in remarks made last spring ,  valkova said the examination does have one shortcoming . 
every year the applicants dont know until march what awaits them ,  whether it be the ort ,  the international exam or the pre-existing system of entrance exams . 
this uncertainty is the main problem that prevents applicants from preparing during the academic year for the testing process . 
valkova said ntrance exams for those who dont pass the ort are not always fair . 
but the remaining <num>10</num>  %  - that is a huge number . 
but i dont have any reliable information on that point . 
checkpoint closing adds new layer to uzbekistan-kyrgyzstan border dispute
osh ,  kyrgyzstan - abdilaziz khakimov said its easy to cross the border to uzbekistan - provided you have a few extra kyrgyz soms . 
if you dont pay ,  you may have problems . 
the kgs <num>10</num>  isnt an official fee ;  its a bribe . 
khakimov said if you dont pay it ,  the border guards will question you at length ,  arrest you or plant drugs on you . 
it used to be easy to cross the border . 
but in june <num>2009</num>  , terrorist bombings and attempted assassinations in khanabad ,  uzbekistan ,  prompted uzbekistan to dig trenches along parts of the border to prevent smuggling and keep out extremists . 
uzbekistan closed the karasu-avtodorozhny checkpoint - the second biggest - march <num>1</num>  saying it needs reconstruction . 
checkpoint closings ,  alleged demands for bribes and a lack of clarity in delimiting the kazakh-uzbek border have been the sources of frequent conflicts of late . 
abdulvakhid ikramov ,  from sura-tash in the karasui district of osh oblast ,  said uzbek border guards shot and killed his <num>29</num> -year-old neighbour ulugbek usmanov when usmanov tried to sneak over the border . 
such events have prompted the formation of the intergovernmental commission for kyrgyz-uzbek border delimitation . 
the committee will meet in april . 
hopefully ,  demarcation of the borderline areas will continue in a constructive way ,  alamanov said . 
this complex issue needs to be studied … very carefully ,  making sure each document either side can present is given due attention . 
ignoring any of those may deadlock the process ,  he said . 
during the past decade ,  meetings and conferences have been held many times . 
it looks like this time finding a compromise is a must . 
nurbek sariyev ,  director of the aksy regional office of the public foundation for international tolerance ,  said that while government officials are busy settling border disputes ,  clashes at local level have been growing more frequent . 
to scale down tensions ,  we have conducted information campaigns for local residents and organised meetings to explain the rules of state border crossing and to hand out booklets and posters ,  he said . 
khakimov is worried about the alleged prevalence of extortion by guards . 
that is why many people ,  skirting the checkpoints ,  try to cross the border elsewhere at their own risk . 
that habit presents another problem . 
uzbek and kyrgyz laws say anyone who crosses the border illegally can held for <num>72</num>  hours and later deported . 
if the detainee has any merchandise ,  he could face smuggling charges and imprisonment for two to five years . 
salkyn abdykariyeva ,  an officer of the kyrgyz state frontier service ,  said that during <num>2009</num>  , <num>148</num>  unlawful frontier crossings and <num>130</num>  violations of border regulations were recorded . 
a spokesman for the kyrgyz border service told central asia online that exact statistics on the offenders place of residence do not exist ,  but that approximately <num>70</num>  %  are kyrgyz citizens . 
to foster ties and promote co-operation with uzbek border services ,  we held a series of working meetings in andizhan ,  tashkent and osh in <num>2009</num>  , abdykariyeva said . 
the purpose of those meetings was to develop a programme of action to jointly patrol some stretches of the border between the two countries . 
taliban exploits central asian instability to facilitate drug smuggling
an uzbek soldier stands guard june <num>24</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , as <num>975</num>  kilogram  of afghan heroin and other narcotics are incinerated in tashkent . 
annually ,  <num>95</num>  tonnes of heroin worth us <num>126</num>  $  billion travel the northern route across central asian countries to europe and beyond . 
 [ str / afp / getty images ] 
tashkent - for centuries ,  the silk road carried silks ,  spices and other goods across central asia between east and west . 
today there is a new central asian trade route - the northern route ,  stretching from afghanistan through tajikistan ,  uzbekistan and turkmenistan . 
but the goods travelling the northern route are debilitating ,  deadly and fund terror .  t
according to rustam nazarov ,  director of the tajik drug control agency ,  there are several ways to transport narcotics via central asia :  from the afghan province of herat ,  via turkmenistan ,  to russia and further to europe ;  or from qunduz ,  afghanistan via tajikistan to russia . 
a third route runs from qunduz ,  across tajikistan to kyrgyzstan ,  kazakhstan and russia . 
smugglers also deliver merchandise from the afghan province of balkh ,  via mazar-i-sharif ,  to uzbekistans termez ,  qarshi ,  bukhara ,  urgench and nuqus ,  then to kazakhstan and russia . 
although the uzbek-afghan border is only <num>137</num>  kilometer  long ,  one analyst said the stretch near termez is difficult to patrol because of rough terrain and the existence of hundreds of mountain paths known only to local guides . 
insiders consider this route ideal for heroin smuggling to central asia . 
however ,  an official of the uzbek state customs committee who requested anonymity ,  said attempts to smuggle narcotics across the uzbek-afghan border are hopeless . 
guards watch the border closely ,  and the customs checkpoint near the bridge across the amudarya contains sophisticated devices to monitor what vehicles and their passengers are carrying . 
the customs representative said drug dealers are much more aggressive in breaching the uzbek-tajik border ,  which is <num>1,161</num>  kilometer  long . 
a source with the uzbek national centre for information analysis on drug control has said pedestrians carry <num>61</num>  %  of the drugs . 
motor vehicles ,  aircraft and ships transport the rest . 
another uzbek customs official ,  erkin khodjayev ,  said couriers often hide narcotics in vegetables ,  fruit ,  secret car compartments ,  hand luggage ,  household appliances ,  and clothes . 
anvar turayev ,  an independent sociologist and former narcologist ,  said the poor and desperate - like mothers of large families or impoverished teenagers - are the most common smugglers . 
oidin akhmedova ,  a woman charged with drug smuggling and with involving a minor in criminal activities ,  said her husband went to russia to look for a job five years ago but vanished . 
she said she had no other way to earn a living :  i worked to earn just enough to buy food and clothes ,  she said . 
akhmedova might spend the next <num>15</num>  years in prison . 
the governments do a poor job of fighting drug use and of patrolling their borders ,  he said . 
analysts at the un office on drugs and crime said lack of interagency co-ordination reduces the efficiency of drug-control measures . 
but sometimes ,  the countries have successfully working together . 
in <num>2008</num>  afghan ,  uzbek ,  tajik and kazakh authorities carried out operation typhoon to curb the activities of a central asian ring smuggling drugs from afghanistan to russia . 
since <num>1994</num>  the un drug control programme has worked with the governments of uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzstan and tajikistan to try to boost co-operation and stem the drug trade .

kyrgyz officers march in formation at the opening of a field bomb disposal training facility february <num>6</num>  in kara jygach village . 
the osce centre in bishkek helped finance its refurbishment . 
kara-jygach ,  kyrgyzstan - kyrgyz troops now have a state-of-the-art sapper training centre at home . 
in february ,  with the support of the organisation for security and co-operation in europe  ( osce )  office in kyrgyzstan ,  the ministry of internal affairs opened a field centre in kara-jygach ,  chui oblast ,  to train its forces . 
…many people say this is just some sort of booth- a field . 
but this is really a big step forward . 
several such steps ,  and international terrorism will completely cease to frighten us ,  said aleksandr ,  a physicist and a sapper in one of the defence ministrys units . 
the site has been home to a sapper field centre built during soviet times . 
soldiers from the ministry of internal affairs ,  the ministry of defence and the special services studied here . 
support from the osce office enabled renovation of the centre and financed state-of-the-art equipment . 
the renovated centre has classrooms for teaching theoretical knowledge and for hands-on training and conducting exercises for security forces . 
in addition ,  the centre contains the most modern computers ,  relevant software ,  and a collection of specialised literature . 
one kyrgyz commander said the centre will help troops resolve terrorist situations with less collateral damage . 
we all remember how four years ago ,  when the militants were discovered in jalal-abad oblast ,   ( they )  dug in at a building in the centre of town and mined it . 
at the time ,  we succeeded in solving the problem . 
however ,  not only were the militants liquidated ;  the building did not escape destruction . 
aleksandr the sapper expressed interest in the centres labs :  as a physicist ,  i was very interested in poking about in them . 
it is a pity they gave us little time for this . 
all the same ,  our day was filled with various classes . 
there is a place here where you can assemble and disassemble explosive devices and study their contents . 
and ,  of course ,  there is a  ( mine )  range ,  he said . 
aleksandr said he was part of a <num>15</num> -member group at the centre . 
each group studies for ten days and is then switched out for a new group . 
plans exist to expand each group to up to <num>100</num>  members in the future . 
ambassador andrew tesoriere ,  head of the osce centre in bishkek ,  said a sister centre opened in bishkek in august <num>2009</num>  .
in these centres ,  employees of kyrgyzstans security agencies undergo training in the disposal of explosives . 
it is also possible to conduct training exercises on the protection of the countrys critical sites ,  such as the power complex ,  said tesoriere . 
tesoriere said that protection of the countrys strategic sites concerns not so much militant attacks as it does natural disasters ,  such as the earthquakes that periodically strike kyrgyzstan . 
maksat has been in the ministry of internal affairs special forces for more than ten years . 
he must remain anonymous not only because he is a sapper ,  but also because ten years ago he helped eliminate terrorists in batken oblast . 
he is not even allowed to remove his mask in the presence of others . 
with respect to the importance of preventative measures ,  tesoriere said :  it is important that the country be ready to repel any encroachment on its sovereignty and borders . 
tajikistan puts largest silver deposit up for bid
jeweller abdurafe salamov works on a silver necklace in his shop at the sadbarg trading centre in dushanbe . 
tajikistans bolshoi koni mansur is one of the biggest silver ore deposits in the world . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe - rights to tajikistans bolshoi koni mansur are up for grabs ,  and some independent observers say chinese companies are the likeliest to win the contract . 
four corporations are competing in a tender for rights to the bolshoi koni mansur mine ,  which industry observers estimate will cost us <num>2</num>  $  billion to develop . 
they are zijin mining and jnmc of china ;  bhp billiton of australia ;  and kazzinc ,  a privatised kazakh conglomerate in which switzerlands glencore international holds a controlling stake . 
the mines size ,  rather than its richness ,  makes it attractive ,  said former tajik deputy prime minister georgii koshkalov . 
nine companies originally competed to enter the tender ,  according to a tajik ministry of energy and industry official who spoke to central asia online on condition of anonymity . 
however ,  others have remarked that russian president dmitry medvedevs refusal last november to contribute to the rogun hydropower project may have caused dushanbe to exclude the russian firm from the tender . 
observers predict a chinese company is likeliest to prevail . 
the chinese side provides more favourable offers ,  said vafo niyatbekov ,  an analyst at the centre for strategic studies . 
with  ( chinas )  financial base ,  chinese companies are favourites practically everywhere ,  agreed alexander shtok of moscow-based <num>2</num>  kelvin  audit business consulting . 
however ,  he added that koni mansur might be an exception . 
if you factor in the high costs  ( of working koni mansur )  ,  kazzinc has a higher chance of winning the rights . 
an international consortium might not create the hoped-for harmony ,  said niyatbekov . 
let one country receive the rights in order for differences not to arise within the  ( hypothetical )  consortium ,  he said . 
whoever wins the bid will ,  like tajikistan ,  have to watch world silver prices . 
the country failed to foresee potential downward pressure on silver prices ,  shtok said . 
the miners will need ,  even in the most favourable scenarios ,  eight to ten years of work to begin extracting silver ,  koshlakov said . 
the government still has not announced a date for the tender ,  but the results are likely before the end of the year ,  said wendy werner ,  the international finance corporations tajikistan country officer . 
tajikistan is admittedly new to the business of holding tenders ,  said shuhrat rahmatboyev ,  deputy chair of the tajik state committee on investment and state property . 
but it can use the experience to attract investments to other deposits ,  he said . 
the countrys main geological administration said that preliminary exploration of two more silver deposits is under way . 
central ,  south asians celebrate april fools day
its april fools day - a day for practical jokes and humour . 
 [ graphic courtesy bridget brown ] 
central  /  south asia -- many will be playing the fool today - or trying to . 
and why not ? 
its april 1st ,  or simply april fools ,  a day with a world-wide tradition of practical jokes and humour . 
but the ancient tradition differs across central and south asia . 
pakistanis will try to laugh away their fears about terror attacks - if only for a day . 
tajiks will take in fun and games -much to the chagrin of some leaders . 
other central asian countries mix distinct traditions with joke-telling . 
in pakistan ,  celebrations are typically subdued out of fear that the taliban - or other militants who oppose such entertainment as un-islamic - might react . 
school campuses are one of the surviving hotbeds of practical jokes ,  many of them directed at the education system . 
once ,  on april 1st a student penned a fake notification from the principal of the institution on the notice board . 
it  ( said )  that monthly tests were being eliminated from the system and there would be only one final exam at the end of the semester ,  recalled shaista ,  a home economics student . 
surprisingly ,  students and teachers fell for the joke until the principal issued a correction . 
of course ,  one reason april fools day draws some ire is simple . 
definitions of whats funny can differ . 
sanat rakhimov ,  former chairman of the tajik energy holding company barki tochik ,  has little appreciation for the day . 
for me any joke is a lie ,  he said ,  especially during the last years as the jokes have become crueler and crueler . 
ordinary tajiks ,  though ,  can swim against the political current . 
they can watch episodes of the club for the happy and resourceful tv game show in dushanbe and other cities . 
or they can enjoy the festivities of ruzi khanda  ( day of laughter )  . 
altaf qadir ,  a doctoral student in pakistan ,  said sometimes pranksters go too far and spoil a good thing . 
as for the days acceptance in pakistan ,  altaf said ,  student groups of right-wing religious parties usually campaign against such entertainment-driven events on such days . 
their plea is that such western customs should not be practised here . 
most ordinary central asians seem to appreciate a break from lifes trying times . 
and the idea of laughter as a health benefit finds support among some doctors . 
uzbek psychologist svetlana skobtseva said ,  having a sense of humour is very healthy . 
often it helps us to survive in critical situations . 
akopian said the country doesnt really have any special traditions ,  therefore we work on that day . 
although i think april 1st should be a day off for comedians . 
what ? 
is he joking ? 
motuyev plays on his audience . 
he is happy to talk whenever he sees a camera or audio recorder <abbr>…</abbr>  life would not be that interesting without him ,  said alexy ,  who works for a bishkek tv station . 
uzbeks often tie jokes to khodzha nasreddin ,  a beloved foolish character found in the folklore of many central asian and middle eastern countries . 
oriat tv-radio company director irina polishuk said her firm broadcasts not only jokes told by programme hosts ,  but also funny stories about the popular and famous . 
among popular pickings are video and audio clips of slips of the tongue . 
polishuk said advertisers place more commercials on oriat on april 1st ,  too . 
uzbek journalist sergey ezhkov publishes jokes in his newspaper ,  uzmetronom . 
some readers take the fake stories to be real news ,  he said . 
interim government offers bakiyev safe exit
deposed kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev told media april <num>9</num>  he was willing to negotiate with the opposition leaders who overthrew him april <num>7</num>  , but he wanted assurances of his personal safety . 
bishkek - in an april <num>9</num>  news conference ,  kyrgyzstans interim leader has offered deposed president kurmanbek bakiyev safe passage into exile if he immediately resigns ,  according to news reports . 
interim kyrgyz leader roza otumbayeva told reporters that the new government would guarantee his safety if he were to resign . 
she did not ,  however ,  guarantee the safety of bakiyevs sons or brother ,  who held major positions in the government alongside him . 
the announcement was a sudden about-face by otumbayeva ,  who had told journalists earlier that she was not planning to hold any talks with bakiyev . 
the fleeing president ,  according to remarks today by acting state security service chairman keneshbek dushebayev at a news conference ,  is still in his native dzhalal-abad oblast . 
the reports that the opposition leaders are willing to talk with bakiyev come a day after bakiyev adamantly stated that he was still president of the country and would not abdicate the position .

we must do everything so that our government will be just ,  otherwise we may suffer the fate of the previous regime ,  said omurbek tekebayev ,  deputy head of the interim government . 
otunbayeva told some <num>3,000</num>  people who gathered for the funeral that law and order has been established in the country .

almazbek atambayev ,  vice prime minister for economics ,  returned from a meeting in moscow with russian prime minister vladimir putin ,  but did not hold a press conference or issue a statement . 
acting bishkek mayor isa omurkulov told journalists that former bishkek mayor nariman tyuleyev has left the city and is being sought by police . 
omurkulov said that some of the mayors staff had engaged in provocative acts and did not want to take measures to calm the public . 
for this they will be fired ,  he said . 
the rest continue to work as before . 
government buildings damaged include the parliament ,  national security service ,  general prosecutors office ,  the presidents residence ,  a department of the ministry of emergency situations ,  the government office building ,  and a department of the tax service .

he urged everyone to remain calm . 
correspondents in osh ,  naryn ,  talas and dzhalal-abad report that those cities are calm and are being patrolled by police and volunteer patrols ,  and that virtually all looting has ended .

parviz ,  a homeless boy of almost <num>14</num>  , washes a car in the parking lot of a dushanbe market . 
experts say street children are often easy prey for militants . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe - parviz looks like a typical teen as he washes cars in the parking lot of a dushanbe market . 
but dont ask him about his home life . 
he came to the capital from kulyab after his parents abandoned him to find work in russia ,  leaving him with relatives . 
i dont want to talk about my family ,  said parviz ,  who will turn <num>14</num>  in a month but who barely looks <num>11</num>  .
i make my living myself . 
he gets <num>5</num>  tjs  ( us <num>1.10</num>  $  )  per car and has chosen work over school for five years . 
a low standard of living and a lack of parental attention have created a two-pronged problem in tajikistan :  more juvenile delinquency and fertile recruiting opportunities for extremists . 
parvizs situation makes him a prime candidate for both . 
every day ,  between five and <num>20</num>  teenagers caught during  ( police )  raids end up in the dushanbe remand house ,  said ministry of internal affairs juvenile delinquency prevention service chief kudratullo azimov . 
it is hard to estimate the number of dushanbes homeless children ,  said tojiddin jalolov ,  head of the nongovernmental organisation child rights centre . 
most were thefts and hooliganism . 
whats more worrying is that younger children are becoming involved in criminal activity . 
but since criminal responsibility for teenagers begins only at age <num>14</num>  , the rest of the crimes committed by younger children are not recorded ,  azimov said . 
parviz knows the temptation . 
once ,  i couldnt restrain myself and stole a purse from a car . 
there was a little money in it . 
but i was caught ,  he said . 
i dont do things like that anymore . 
it is better for me to make it on my own . 
tajikistan has one operating juvenile correctional facility . 
located in dushanbe ,  it houses approximately <num>60</num>  teenagers aged <num>14</num> -<num>18</num>  .
jalolov explained that poverty and illiteracy are factors in the rising crime rate . 
as for being targets of extremists ,  umed ,  a <num>15</num> -year-old car washer ,  said bearded men have started sitting near him and asking him questions . 
they talked to me about islam ,  he said . 
once they asked me in the morning to distribute some sort of paper to homes . 
i was frightened and refused . 
now i avoid them . 
other street children are not able to avoid them . 
i met with nasibulloh zabirzod from isfara ,  azimov said . 
it is possible that the teen did not know their objective ,  but the boy knew that they were carrying out something illegal . 
on february <num>15</num>  , the sogd oblast court sentenced nasibulloh ,  an 11t grader ,  to eight years in prison for aiding terrorists because he maintained contact with his uncle zailobiddin ibragimov ,  who was wanted on charges of involvement with the islamic movement of uzbekistan . 
 ( the extremists )   <abbr>…</abbr>  see their being religious and in need as meaning they are potentially suitable for membership . 
the extremists buy them ,  said azimov . 
children from isfara district - where religious extremism and illiteracy flourish - are particularly vulnerable to the influence of illegal groups ,  said jalolov . 
in order to get children to understand the difference between real islam and misinterpreted islam ,  tajik schools have introduced islamic studies into the curriculum . 
but street children dont attend school . 
officials are at odds how best to set delinquents right . 
according to azimov ,  teenagers aged <num>14</num> -<num>16</num>  can receive sentences of up to seven years imprisonment for serious crimes ;  for those aged <num>16</num> -<num>18</num>  , it is ten years . 
social and legal services are involved in this work as well as a psychologist ,  said jalolov . 
this is help for the children as an alternative to administering a punishment . 
this year ,  with the support of unicef and the swiss co-operation office ,  similar centres will begin operation elsewhere . 
deputy chair of the national commission on rights of the child dilorom mirsaidova said her commission also has a national plan of action for <num>2010</num> -<num>2015</num>  to reform the juvenile legal system . 
it outlines measures to help children who have committed crimes and their families . 
one of the main objectives is to prevent delinquency . 
we hold educational talks in schools with parents of young offenders under the age of <num>14</num>  , said a police officer who asked for anonymity . 
experience shows that it is most often teenagers who dropped out of school after ninth grade who turn to crime . 
apa is part of a movement to have kasymovs remains repatriated to kazakhstan .

 )  was created in almaty in march in the hope that kazakhstan can regain khan kenesary kasymovs head . 
they claim it is in a russian museums collections . 
in soviet times ,  the name kenesary kasymov was banned ,  said galina matveyeva ,  a historian at the kazakh national academy of arts . 
she said kasymovs uprising against russia was considered feudalistic and monarchic ,  and that those who disagreed were sent to stalinist camps . 
upon gaining independence ,  kazakhs began to demand the return of the head ,  but to no avail yet . 
their first challenge is to establish that russia indeed possesses it . 
representatives of the hermitage and the russian embassy in astana told central asia online that there is no such artefact in their possession . 
is seeking the support of both kazakh and russian leaders . 
regaining the head would be a symbolic act of atonement for the collective sins of the kazakh people ,  allowing the nation to truly begin to move forward ,  movement co-ordinator nurlan amrekulov said . 
only after being purged of the sins and mistakes of our ancestors ,  repenting to one another and repaying the good hospitality of kazakhs - only in the course of this common holy affair - will we be able to become a single people ,  he said . 
talgat aidorov ,  a descendent of the khan ,  is confident that with wide public support ,  the kremlin might make concessions and return the remains . 
former senator zauresh battalova ,  a leader of vernyom khana kene ! 
in the movements astana office ,  is relying on international laws of restitution . 
members of the movement believe the state is making no effort to solve the problem . 
a joint search  [ with the russians ]  is under way ,  said kazakh foreign ministry spokesman ilyas omarov . 
however ,  i cannot say anything concrete about the results . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  the process is moving slowly . 
the government doesnt want to spoil relations with russia ,  former presidential candidate zhaksybai bazilbayev said . 
but the authorities also cannot ignore public opinion . 
in this process ,  very much depends on the breadth of public support . 
bishkek returned those bones in <num>2005</num>  .
they now await genetic examination ,  once the kazakhs are able to reunite them with the missing head . 
central asia onlines correspondent visited the temporary burial site where kasymovs body lies ,  in the village of katyrbulak ,  talgar region ,  almaty oblast . 
watching over the burial site is <num>61</num> -year-old aisara apa ,  keeper of the local cemetery . 
she is a descendent of kenesarys younger brother nauryzbai ,  whom kyrgyz rulers also captured and killed . 
kasymovs body lies in a fenced-in grave on the hillside directly behind apas house . 
above it stands a pole surmounted with a crescent and carrying the khans arabic-inscribed green banner . 
for ordinary kazakhs ,  returning the head of the last khan is not a trivial issue . 
i believe that if new guinea ,  australia and american indians are regaining the bones of their ancestors <abbr>…</abbr>  from british museums and private collections through the courts ,  then we also need to do everything to regain  ( the head )  and pay our last respects to our ruler ,  said almaty resident ermek sadykov ,  <num>28</num>  .
kyrgyz government to trim presidential powers

 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
bishkek ,  dzhalal-abad ,  kyrgyzstan -- the interim kyrgyz government is trimming presidential powers to prevent a recurrence of the perceived excesses of deposed president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  news media reported april <num>19</num>  .
omurbek tekebayev ,  deputy chairman of the interim government ,  told journalists the president will no longer have immunity from prosecution and that members of the presidents family will no longer be able to earn a government income . 
the parliament will choose cabinet ministers ,  and a national council for justice will name judges . 
the president will lose legislative and executive powers . 
the government  ( cabinet )  will inherit the executive powers . 
tekebayev added that the presidents party will not be allowed to hold more than <num>50</num>  seats in the <num>90</num> -seat parliament ,  no matter what percentage of the vote it wins . 
the proposed changes will be submitted to an april <num>25</num>  constitutional convention ,  he said . 
even as the interim government works to draft a new constitution and plan for elections ,  the situation in the country remains unstable . 
the acting bishkek mayor faced about <num>1,000</num>  demonstrators earlier in the day from the nearby countryside . 
the demonstrators ,  armed with steel bars ,  came to demand allotments of land . 
acting mayor isa omurkulov promised to make land allotments outside the city limits ,  according to media . 
russian news media reported that the demonstrators shouted anti-russian slogans and demanded that russians leave the country . 
many stores remain closed in the city of dzhalal-abad . 
police are also staying off the streets of the southern city to express their discontent . 
they want the demands they made at an april <num>17</num>  demonstration to be met ,  said bolot ,  a police sergeant who would give only his first name . 
the officers wanted the new interior minister ,  bolotbek sherniyazov ,  to resign and punishment of the demonstrators who attacked the former interior minister  ( moldomusa kongatiyev )  in talas april <num>6</num>  .
they also wanted pay raises and no misuse of law enforcement agencies for political purposes ,  he said . 
later ,  the police of bishkek also held a rally demanding sherniyazov resign . 
the police of both cities got their wish ;  later in the day the interim government appointed a new interior minister ,  bokyt alynbekov ,  who previously was sherniyazovs deputy . 
in osh ,  police officers made similar demands at a demonstration of their own april <num>19</num>  .
acting oblast governor sooronbai zheenbekov promised to take their demands into account and stressed that the first priority was to restore stability . 
at the same time ,  the interim government's co-ordination council for osh oblast decided that the oshtv ,  mezon-tv ,  ltr and keremet tv stations need the council's permission to broadcast certain stories ,  a central asia online correspondent said . 
the same requirement applies to the local newspapers itogi nedeliya ,  osh zhanyrygy ,  osh sadosi and ekho osha . 
the decision is meant to stabilise the situation nationwide ,  according to the document . 
news media violating the pre-approval requirement for such stories are subject to prosecution ,  according to the document . 
meanwhile ,  in dzhalal-abad ,  supporters of bakiyev have proclaimed a new oblast governor ,  according to a central asia online correspondent . 
the demonstrators ,  who seized the oblast government building on april <num>17</num>  , named paizulla rakhmanova to the post .

he moved there with his parents from konya ,  turkey ,  and his parents opened a store there . 
ive spent the majority of my life here ,  he said . 
bishkek is my home . 
nobody ever said a harsh word to me . 
but this month ,  everything changed . 
in the first days of the uprising ,  when the looters came to loot stores ,  i several times heard calls to chase out the turks and russians but figured they werent serious ,  he said . 
several turkish acquaintances stores were looted ,  but i thought this wasnt connected to nationality . 
our store didnt get looted ;  my father and i had stored all our merchandise in the warehouse in advance . 
on april <num>19</num>  , kabakchy was walking home when a gang of five or six young men started yelling at him from across the street . 
they accosted him when he tried to escape . 
one grabbed me by the shoulder and asked what i was doing here . 
i answered that i lived nearby . 
then he said to his friends ,  this turk is living it up in the capital ,  while we dont have anything . 
i said ,  brother ,  why are you acting this way ? 
he pushed me and shouted that he was no brother of mine and told me to get out of kyrgyzstan . 
the men beat up kabakchy and took his wallet . 
they threatened to burn down his house if he complained to police . 
unlawful seizures of land and looting began in bishkek after the april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  uprising and have since continued . 
in the past <num>15</num>  years ,  one-third of kyrgyzstans population has left the countryside for the city ,  with many moving to bishkek and osh in search of jobs . 
five years ago ,  when now-deposed president kurmanbek bakiyev gained power through demonstrations ,  mass seizures of land began around bishkek . 
the authorities legalised the expropriations ,  and new settlements cropped up around the capital . 
now ,  another wave of property seizures has begun . 
even as the interim government vows to firmly end any actions by squatters ,  acting bishkek mayor isa omurkulov promised land to squatters outside the city limits in statements april <num>19</num>  and <num>20</num>  .
omurkulov was trying to calm demonstrators who were demanding <num>400</num>  square metres of land each . 
he told the demonstrators there was no spare land in the suburbs ,  but suggested they take plots of land in the village of ozernoe ,  not far from the manas airport . 
the squatters responded to that suggestion by blocking the road with boulders ,  preventing the mayor from leaving ,  news media reported . 
as a result of confrontations with squatters over land ,  five people died and another <num>28</num>  were injured in mayevka and other areas . 
the squatters have been voicing nationalistic slogans and calling for russians and turks to leave kyrgyzstan . 
 " my family and i are afraid to leave the house "  ,  said kabakchy . 
he added that an uncle telephoned from turkey and urged the family to return there . 
 " there's no reason to live one's whole life in fear . 
it's upsetting - this is our home "  . 
a central asia online reporter spoke with a number of turks ,  meskhetian turks and russians in bishkek . 
many are frightened and are contemplating leaving . 
some ,  however ,  believed the anger would soon pass . 
 " of course it's worrisome when anti-russian sayings circulate and the mob sets out to sack the city and the homes of russians in the surrounding villages "  ,  viktoriia zemlenukhina ,  a 5th-year undergraduate at the tourism academy in bishkek ,  said . 
 " but i don't believe that the kyrgyz suddenly and immediately detest us russians . 
i believe that all this superficial nonsense will amount to nothing "  . 
the turkish and russian diasporas in bishkek have issued statements calling on the interim government to stabilise the situation . 
authorities have identified several hot spots of unrest south and east of the capital ,  omurkulov said . 
the new government will defend property rights ,  he said ,  adding that within city limits no free plots of land exist . 
one member of a volunteer patrol characterised the nationalistic slogans as  " incitement with the purpose of attracting attention from the public and the government ,  since the new government had been ignoring the squatters "  . 
a policeman ,  who spoke on condition of anonymity ,  said ,   " social tension within the population is very high ,  and people trapped in their hopeless situations are resorting to desperate acts . 
the government and law enforcement understand that we'd better not inflame the situation . 
bilim ,  a <num>29</num> -year-old resident of a new house north of the capital ,  said five years ago he occupied a plot of land and built a fence around it . 
 " i was tired of bouncing from apartment to apartment . 
our new neighbourhood is considered illegal . 
the authorities can tear these houses down at any moment . 
we exist ,  but not on paper . 
without a residence permit ,  he said he can't find a job or enrol his children in school . 
authorities have distributed plots of land around the capital to socioeconomically marginal individuals ,  bishkek resident azamat tazhibai said . 
the makeshift clay-and-straw slums around bishkek won't solve homelessness ,  he said . 
he expects housing problems to worsen in the capital . 
 " villagers already have plots of land in the villages ,  but they come to the capital and receive land here too "  ,  he complained . 
 " this is happening while residents of the capital are crammed inside their apartments "  . 
migrants from the countryside said that economic need forced them to come . 
 " in the village ,  there's no work or money "  ,  kanat ,  a migrant worker ,  said . 
 " the work that does exist there is seasonal and badly paid . 
here  ( in the capital )  it's possible to make money . 
why can't we receive a small plot of land in order to build a house "  ? 
bakiyev renounces resignation ;  interim government authorises deadly force against looters
supporters of ousted kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev erect yurts outside the dzhalal-abad government building april <num>20</num>  .
after the interim government regained control of the building and square april <num>21</num>  police removed the yurts . 
 [ alisher karimov ] 
bishkek -- the interim kyrgyz government issued a decree april 21authorising security forces to use deadly force against looters and squatters ,  as it continued to fight lawlessness and challenges to its authority . 
in an effort to calm public tensions ,  the government also signed a decree ,  retroactive to april <num>1</num>  , reducing utility rates . 
electricity rates were reduced from <num>1.5</num>  kgs  ( us <num>0.03</num>  $  )  per kilowatt-hour to <num>0.7</num>  kgs . 
hot water rates were reduced from <num>1,050</num>  kgs to <num>400</num>  kgs . 
heating will go from <num>1,050</num>  kgs per giga-calorie to <num>715</num>  kgs . 
meanwhile ,  former president kurmanbek bakiyev rescinded his resignation during a press conference in minsk ,  saying he remains the legally elected head of kyrgyzstan . 
bakiyev ,  who arrived in belarus several days ago ,  said ,  a band of self-proclaimed leaders declared itself in power and is committing lawlessness without bounds . 
in light of the turmoil in kyrgyzstan ,  he said he would not recognise his resignation . 
bloggers and activists in kyrgyzstan responded to bakiyevs announcement by organising a mass text-message and e-mail campaign addressed to belarusian president aleksandr lukashenko . 
the suggested text is ,  you can keep bakiyev ! 
in bishkek ,  land seizures and the chanting of nationalistic slogans continued . 
members of the turkish ,  kurdish ,  azeri and russian communities were the targets of attacks april <num>19</num> -<num>20</num>  in mayevka that killed five and injured dozens of people ,  according to the interior ministry . 
but the land problem provoked it . 
a number of officials and experts said some people want to drive out foreigners in order to seize their land . 
a turkish community leader agreed . 
russian president dmitry medvedev announced april <num>20</num>  that he instructed defence minister anatoly serdiukov to protect russian citizens and property . 
russia has several military bases in kyrgyzstan . 
the events of april <num>19</num> -<num>20</num>  in suburban bishkek have aroused <abbr>…</abbr>  the deep concern of the russian embassy ,  russian ambassador to kyrgyzstan vladimir vlasov said at a news conference april <num>21</num>  .
he said the embassy remains in constant contact with the interim government and local law enforcement . 
but the russian foreign ministry doesnt consider the recent kyrgyz events nationalistically motivated persecution of the russian-speaking population ,  said viktor kharchenko ,  an assistant to vlasov . 
however ,  since the change of government ,  the workload at the russian immigration office in kyrgyzstan has tripled ,  according to interfax . 
the immigration service said it has had <num>290</num>  visitors a day instead of the usual <num>100</num>  .
the bishkek prosecutor april <num>20</num>  confiscated us <num>20</num>  from accounts registered to friends of bakiyevs son ,  maxim . 
the government has also requested a us <num>20</num>  grant from the un to help finance elections and a referendum to amend the constitution . 
it is also requesting money from international and charitable organisations to help reform law enforcement . 
the general prosecutor april <num>21</num>  opened a criminal case against former energy minister ilyas davydov ,  according to news reports ,  for allegedly signing contracts that are at odds with the national interest and for embezzling state funds . 
in dzhalal-abad the interim government and its supporters confronted pro-bakiyev demonstrators who had occupied the oblast administrative building and the square outside it . 
verbal exchanges degenerated into a brawl and rocks were thrown . 
however supporters of the interim government dispersed bakiyevs supporters ,  and regained control in the area . 
authorities cleared the square of yurts that pro-bakiyev demonstrators had erected . 
police also arrested the pro-bakiyev alternative governor ,  paizulla rakhmanov ,  and several of his backers ,  acting oblast governor bektur asanov told central asia online . 
asanov is trying to return the oblast to the control of the interim government . 
we dont have time to demonstrate anymore ,  he said to those who were still occupying the square . 
we need to work . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  starting today the police and other forces are going to carry out their duties . 
stalbek bakyrov ,  the new head of the oblast office for internal affairs ,  said all units of the oblast police have returned to work . 
asanov attended negotiations april <num>20</num>  in osh to convince the police to return to work . 
we managed to persuade  ( them )  that some of their demands ,  like pay raises ,  were simply impossible to meet right now ,  asanov said . 
but we met one of their key demands - firing acting interior minister bolot sherniyazov "  . 
central asia strives to prevent weapons from falling into illegal market
kyrgyz opposition supporters vie for a rifle during an anti-government protest in bishkek april <num>7</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
central asian governments deny having an illegal weapons problem . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
bishkek -- central asia is awash in guns and authorities are trying to prevent them from falling into the hands of islamic extremists or criminals ,  or turning up on the black market . 
uzbekistan says illegal arms there have been smuggled in through kyrgyzstan and tajikistan ,  having originally come from russia ,  china ,  and afghanistan . 
an anonymous official in the tajik mias criminal investigation department said people are afraid to turn in illegal weapons . 
they are still handing them over ,  the official said . 
often not to law enforcement ,  but unloading them ,  leaving them in landfills and anonymously reporting to the police that they found caches of weapons . 
in <num>1993</num>  , the supreme council of tajikistan adopted a law for the voluntary surrender and seizure of firearms and ammunition ,  and promised not to prosecute anyone who voluntarily surrendered weapons . 
but ,  for more than a year ,  people did not dare to hand over firearms ,  said the source . 
head of tajik mia press services mahmadullo asadulloyev said that since <num>1994</num>  , approximately <num>32,000</num>  firearms have been surrendered or seized . 
most of the weapons are soviet-made kalashnikov assault rifles ,  makarov pistols and grenade launchers . 
seizing firearms from the population is one of our main tasks ,  said asadulloyev . 
kyrgyzstans interim government asked citizens to voluntarily surrender their arms within a <num>10</num> -day period . 
as of april <num>22</num>  , <num>135</num>  firearms and <num>18,000</num>  rounds of ammunition had been turned in . 
the ministry will not prosecute those who voluntarily surrender their weapons . 
akyl ,  one of the many who participated in clashes with police near the office of the social-democratic party in bishkek on april <num>7</num>  , said he voluntarily surrendered captured ammunition . 
when we drove back the special forces ,  they abandoned their vehicles and took refuge in a neighbouring building ,  he said . 
we went to turn over the police vans and opened the rear doors ,  from which weapons and crates of grenades showered down on us . 
we snatched them all up . 
the kyrgyz mia said civilians captured approximately <num>100</num>  firearms and more than <num>11,000</num>  munitions ,  grenades ,  explosives and explosive ordnances . 
however the number of weapons stolen is far larger ,  some say . 
kakchekeyev said organised criminal groups seized most of the weapons by deliberately storming mia storehouses . 
uzbekistans ministry of defence said that country has no illegal weapons . 
buying firearms on the black market in the country is almost impossible ,  said a source at the uzbek defence ministry who requested anonymity . 
but the uzbek prosecutor generals office said illegal weapons are in the country . 
the weapons confiscated during searches fall into the territory of uzbekistan through kyrgyzstan and tajikistan ,  said one source at that office . 
the uzbek supreme assembly is preparing to adopt a weapons law . 
a government decree said it was necessary to adopt the law because the existing legal framework cannot regulate the number of new weapons . 
asadulloyev said the illegal weapons are falling into the hands of extremists and criminals . 
law enforcement officers often discover caches of weapons that belong to extremist and radical groups illegally operating  ( in )  tajikistan . 
there are cases where weapons are seized from afghan drug traffickers . 
kyrgyzstan has launched operations to seize weapons from the population . 
the kyrgyz mia said border police in talas oblast are helping police seize firearms ,  including pistols and sniper rifles . 
in tokmok ,  police have made several arrests and seized weapons and ammunition from citizens . 
according to reports from the mia ,  it is common for people to keep illegal weapons hidden in abandoned buildings ,  trash bins and inconspicuous boxes on the streets . 
to prevent arms from falling into the wrong hands ,  the governments of central asia are tightening the requirements for receiving a weapons permit . 
a former police officer said that despite tajikistans law on weapons ,  which permits certain categories of citizens ,   ( such as private security guards and bank employees )  to carry firearms ,  only security forces employees are receiving mia permission . 
the banks and security agencies hire law enforcement officers who are allowed to carry and possess firearms as armed guards ,  said the officer . 
some former employees of the security services - including me - have honorary pistols ,  but they are only given out with the personal signature of … the president . 
after my death ,  my relatives must return the pistol to the mia within one day . 
international organisations ,  such as the un and osce ,  are helping central asian governments remove illegal weapons from circulation . 
kakchekeyev believes a useful approach would be one used in tajikistan during the civil war . 
un peacekeeping forces got the idea to have citizens turn in the weapons not voluntarily ,  but in exchange for food and humanitarian aid . 
it was quite a success . 
the osce has been supporting the reclaiming and destruction of weapons in tajikistan for several years . 
from <num>2005</num>  to <num>2009</num>  , the osce centre ran a programme on small arms and light weapons ,  destroying more than <num>34</num>  tonnes of weapons . 
in the near future ,  together with the  ( tajik )  ministry of defence and the mia ,  the osce centre plans to begin destroying explosives and munitions stored in the mias warehouses and also equipping weapons and munitions repositories with additional means of protection ,  said osce centre representative farhod abdurahmanov . 
kakchekeyev said that during the recent chaos ,  kyrgyzstan was lucky because police armouries in the south ,  where the islamic movement of uzbekistan has bases ,  were not raided . 
purely theoretically ,  weapons from talas oblast might go to the south ,  but in any case ,  these will be isolated instances ,  he said . 
proposed constitution released for public discussion
demonstrators in bishkek call for former president kurmanbek bakiyev and others to be arrested and held accountable for their alleged crimes . 
while almost daily demonstrations continue around the country for and against the former administration ,  a constitutional commission of the interim government released a draft constitution for national discussion april <num>26</num>  .
the constitutional working group put the proposal online for public review april <num>26</num>  , beginning a two-week period for comment . 
afterward the comments will be considered and incorporated into a final draft that will be put to a national referendum june <num>27</num>  .
the main changes are to sections governing the election and functions of the three branches of the state :  - the president ,  parliament and cabinet . 
the proposed constitution would make kyrgyzstan a parliamentary republic . 
several analysts ,  however ,  said kyrgyz reality is far from amenable to a strong-parliament system . 
furthermore ,  the kyrgyz have a psychological predisposition toward rowdiness . 
combine these three matrices ,  and youll get a chaotic mess that is supposed to run the country . 
we have to try this process sometime ,  he said . 
everybodys frightened that it might not work out ,  but we have to try . 
its nothing terrible if the first attempt fails . 
the draft calls for parliament to have <num>105</num>  or <num>120</num>  deputies . 
the last session had <num>90</num>  .
the increase stems from the gradual growth of the role of parties ,  marat kazakpayev ,  a political science professor at the kyrgyz-russian slavic university ,  said . 
tekebayev put in a <num>5</num>  %  vote threshold for a party to be seated in parliament . 
this means thered likely be only three parties in parliament - the social democrats ,  ata-meken and ak-shumkar . 
we have to lower that threshold and give political groupings of young kyrgyz more of a chance . 
the young members of parliament would nominate a prime minister  ( according to the new constitution )  ,  he said . 
formerly ,  the president nominated the prime minister ,  and parliament confirmed the nominee . 
also under the new system ,  the prime minister rather than the president would nominate members of the cabinet and would have full responsibility for the countrys administrative and economic life and partial responsibility for domestic political life . 
nominations for directors of the national bank and members of the security council would remain the responsibility of the head of state . 
the president would need the prime ministers consent to fire ministers . 
 " the biggest difference concerning the president is  ( he or she )  can have only a single five-year term "  ,  kazakpayev said . 
 " that's understandable . 
we had two presidents ,  both of whom were overthrown . 
the presidency has been seriously discredited . 
but i'm still against this revision . 
the experience of the most advanced countries shows that the optimal variant is two terms "  . 
the prime minister ,  backed by the ruling party ,  would be the leading figure in the country ,  tekebayev said . 
prime ministers would define the parameters of foreign policy . 
the draft constitution will be printed in newspapers soon ,  tekebayev said . 
the constitutional convention will review the feedback until may <num>14</num>  .
the convention's composition and number of members remain undefined ,  however . 
 " we can't talk about the constitution when the current government isn't even legitimate "  ,  said toktaiym umetaliyeva ,  chairwoman of the country's association of ngos and nonprofits . 
 " first we have to put in all the attributes of state power and then  ( we can )  change the laws "  . 
the constitutional convention is scheduled to prepare the final version of the constitution by may <num>19</num>  .
underfinanced scientists flee uzbekistan
tashkent - scientists are fleeing uzbekistan for economically greener pastures . 
the government has tried to develop science and industry ,  but scientists find the budget inadequate . 
in <num>2009</num>  , the government allocated only uzs <num>32</num>  billion  ( us$ <num>16</num>  meter  )  for scientific research . 
the academy of sciences has <num>5,590</num>  employees ,  including <num>2,421</num>  researchers and <num>107</num>  academicians . 
but it had four times as many employees when the soviet union collapsed in <num>1991</num>  .
the general state of scientific research in uzbekistan leaves much to be desired ,  said an employee of the polymer chemistry and physics research institute ,  who spoke on condition of anonymity . 
many researchers lack necessary materials ,  chemicals and equipment . 
many see emigration as a way out ,  with apparently better opportunities for scientific development existing abroad ,  he said . 
mirkhashimov tried his luck in britain . 
he said he heard at the outset that he would never enjoy the status attained by british specialists . 
that meant my earnings would always be much lower than those of my … colleagues ,  and generally ,  there would be fewer opportunities opening up . 
he returned home after his project ended . 
some researchers seek international grants so they can remain in uzbekistan . 
for example ,  the nuclear physics institute ,  whose history is linked with the development of uranium and gold mining industries in the republic ,  has closely co-operated with the british closed nuclear cities partnership  ( cncp )  programme . 
the cncp has co-operated with the nuclear physics institute since <num>2004</num>  , implementing projects to cleanse ,  desalinate and decontaminate drinking water ,  refine gems and produce capsular gamma emitters . 
the institute ,  faced with the loss of military contracts after the end of the ussr ,  has shrunk from <num>3,000</num>  employees to <num>550</num>  .
but he said he knew of nobody working on foreign nuclear weapons projects in violation of international agreements . 
many former defence industry workers <abbr>…</abbr>  would be readily employed by countries seeking to obtain nuclear weapons technology ,  he said . 
therefore ,  in his view ,  uzbekistan needs to create decent living conditions for domestic scientists . 
the national security service  ( snb )  tries to prevent scientists from working for rogue nations ,  the anonymous nuclear physics institute staffer said . 
his colleagues have to pledge not to disclose insider information and live under close surveillance . 
secret agents know all about the carriers of classified information ;  trips abroad for them are only possible after special briefing and the signing of relevant non-disclosure commitments ,  the staffer said . 
the internet helps scholars hook up with colleagues and find opportunities in europe and the united states ,  said aziz umaraliyev of the algorithm and cybernetics research institute . 
in tashkent there are organisations to help uzbek scholars find employment abroad . 
and some scientists prefer to stay in uzbekistan close to family and friends . 
the state has been doing everything to boost scientific development and encourage young talent ;  therefore ,  uzbek science has not been marking time ,  said academician sayera rashidova ,  director of the polymer chemistry and physics research institute . 
taliban targets civilians ahead of major offensive
an afghan soldier keeps watch from a machine gun nest in the shahwali kot district of kandahar may <num>8</num>  .
the taliban announced a new campaign of attacks on foreigners and their surrogates in afghanistan may <num>9</num>  .
kandahar - as afghan-led forces prepare to launch a major offensive in the southern province of kandahar ,  taliban fighters are carrying out a series of bombings ,  assassinations and suicide raids . 
thousands of additional coalition troops have already been stationed near kandahar over the past few months . 
they are girding to help the afghan army conduct an operation of unprecedented size and scope since the ouster of the taliban in <num>2001</num>  .
the military offensive is planned for sometime in june ,  but the taliban is trying to disrupt plans with bombings and assassinations . 
the upcoming offensive will involve at least <num>23,000</num>  afghan and nato troops ,  according to news reports . 
the taliban fighters were targeting officials and foreigners before ,  but now they are killing innocent people to degrade the security situation in the city ,  khalid pashtoon ,  a member of parliament from kandahar ,  told central asia online . 
on april <num>19</num>  , a gunman killed azizullah yarmal ,  the deputy mayor of kandahar ,  as he prayed in a local mosque . 
one high-profile international organisation decided kandahar is just too perilous . 
the un pulled its foreign staff out of kandahar in april . 
ahmad wali karzai ,  afghan president hamid karzais half-brother and chairman of the provincial council ,  blasted the decision . 
the security situation is not bad enough to justify the uns <abbr>…</abbr>  closure of its offices in town ,  ahmad karzai said at a news conference april <num>27</num>  .
the withdrawal will affect not only international organisations efforts to execute development projects and meet peoples basic needs ,  it will create a negative impression about these bodies . 
the operations that were conducted in marjah of helmand were a kind of limited area operation ,  he said . 
that type of operation wont work in kandahar ,  since the taliban is not fighting in any specific area or district . 
the difficult security situation in kandahar compounds local misery in another way :  nobody can invest in providing facilities or services to the population . 
mindful of that ,  kandahar operation planners will focus on establishing or restoring good governance in the provinces hinterlands once they assert control ,  kandahar governor toryalai vissa insisted . 
we will not focus on the military side of these operations ;  we want to improve governance and provide facilities for the people of kandahar ,  vissa said in a video conference april <num>3</num>  .
in those outlying areas ,  as insurgents and civilians await the offensive ,  the taliban is demonstrating its clout by prohibiting mobile phone providers from switching on their antennae at night . 
the ban is meant to prevent the local population from aiding afghan and international troops in their night-time raids . 
the taliban currently controls <num>70</num> -<num>80</num>  %  of the province ,  taliban spokesman qari yousuf ahmadi told central asia online . 
pashtoon disagrees with that claim . 
there are a few districts that are not under the control of the government ,  but it doesnt mean that the taliban is dealing with people over there ,  said pashtoon . 
in fact ,  there is nothing to be controlled . 
dzhalal-abad kyrgyzstan -- one man died and dozens of people were injured in a second day of street battles in dzhalal-abad before the interim government regained control of the situation may <num>14</num>  .
the government also put down smaller-scale confrontations with supporters of ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev in osh and batken . 
in bishkek ,  the interim government released a recording from kyrgyz intelligence of phone calls between usen sydykov ,  head of the former presidential administration ,  and a number of former members of parliament ,  officials ,  and governors . 
in the conversations ,  sydykov gives instructions on what should be done after learning that the officials received money promised to them ,  news media reported . 
keneshbek duishebayev ,  chief of the national security service ,  told reporters that marat bakiyev ,  the older son of the deposed president ,  is financing the disorder from almaty . 
kazakhstani authorities ,  however ,  denied that marat bakiyev is in the country . 
masaliyev ,  a former parliamentary deputy and leader of the communist party ,  could be heard on the recordings . 
police said they might also arrest former bishkek mayor nariman tiuleev . 
as an almost surreal backdrop ,  trucks dumped rocks on the pavement for people to use as weapons . 
in the morning ,  a pro-bakiyev demonstration began on the square in front of the oblast building . 
speakers ,  including former oblast governor koshbai mesirov and paizulla rakhmonov ,  demanded the resignation of the interim government and called its members bandits . 
on lenin street ,  home of the oblast administration building ,  interim government supporters gathered . 
they carried flags of the ata-meken party and demanded that the bakiyevites vacate the building . 
about <num>400</num>  people showed up for each side . 
many were armed with clubs and some also carried molotov cocktails . 
the police stayed out of the budding confrontation . 
by noon ,  a disorganised band of government supporters headed for the occupied building . 
the two sides began throwing rocks at each other ,  followed by fistfights . 
it was impossible to determine which side fired the shots ,  and both sides accused the other of opening fire . 
bakiyev supporters said four of their members were seriously wounded and five others were less severely injured . 
several doctors came from bishkek to help in dzhalal-abad . 
central asia onlines correspondent reports that at 3pm ,  government supporters sealed off lenin street and gunfire resumed . 
the two sides exchanged intense volleys ,  using weapons ranging from pistols to automatic rifles . 
many more fell wounded . 
at 5pm ,  staffers at the oblast hospital announced that operating rooms were packed ,  and doctors were working nonstop . 
according to the dzhalal-abad ministry of health ,  <num>26</num>  individuals sought medical treatment for gunshot wounds ,  and <num>43</num>  for injuries from rocks and clubs . 
one <num>30</num> -year-old man ,  whose affiliation remained undisclosed ,  was killed . 
combat ,  while gradually waning ,  continued in the centre of town until darkness fell . 
as darkness fell ,  pro-government supporters had control of the dzhalal-abad administration building ;  but ,  unlike in batken and osh ,  the bakiyevites did not disperse . 
in osh ,  meanwhile ,  a delegation led by acting defence minister ismail isakov tried may <num>13</num>  to negotiate with pro-bakiyev demonstrators . 
however ,  talks went nowhere and the government ejected the demonstrators from three occupied oblast government buildings ,  a government representative from bishkek said . 
osh was relatively peaceful throughout the day . 
toward evening ,  acting governor sooronbai zheenbekov returned after being forced to flee a day earlier . 
 " major confrontations didn't occur "  ,  said an interior ministry spokesperson who asked to remain anonymous . 
 " only some minor pushing and shoving ,  but nobody was injured "  . 
police and volunteer patrols were on the streets . 
they stayed in the building for a while ,  making noise . 
the resumption of government control in batken was accompanied by a transition at the top . 
sultanbai aimigitov replaced karamat orozov as acting governor . 
the government might convene an emergency session to discuss the evolving situation ,  an interim government spokesman said . 
 " we've got the situation under control and right now don't see the need to ask outside forces for help "  ,  he said .

the preferential credit provided to tajikistan by france is in the form of a long-term loan ;  funds are allocated for construction of a passenger terminal and for outfitting it with the necessary hardware ,  the finance minister stated after the signing ceremony . 
plans for the international passenger terminal were unveiled in dushanbe at the end of july by representatives of two french construction firms :  sofema group and alpha airport . 
the project calls for a total footprint of <num>11,000</num>  square metres ,  or approximately four times the size of dushanbes current airport . 
during their presentation ,  the representatives of the construction firms set the project completion date as the end of <num>2009</num>  .
kyrgyzstan might stop attracting investor attention
kambar-ata2 is one of the projects kyrgyzstan built with foreign investment . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
kyrgyzstan has grown ever less attractive to external investors during the past five years … because any newcomer to our market was compelled to enter into negotiations with bakiyevs appointees ,  former parliamentarian and economist kubanychbek idinov observed . 
now ,  making new contacts will take a lot of time . 
zhumakadyr akeneyev ,  a professor at kyrgyzstan national university who led the supervisory development fund until april <num>7</num>  , said the precarious political situation goes hand in hand with economic instability ,  so investors want to see what the interim government does . 
to keep foreign investors from retreating ,  the interim government has issued a decree on protecting investments . 
those hampering the attraction of investment as well as those unlawfully seizing assets of any form of ownership shall be subject to criminal or civil liability ,  the interim government said . 
in the past ,  kyrgyzstan sought investors for the development of gold deposits ;  the re-commissioning of some soviet-era industrial plants  ( the maili-sui light bulb factory ,  the khaidarkan mercury plant and the kristall semiconductor plant )  ;  and the construction of a second hydropower plant unit at kambar-ata . 
acting financial police chief erkin bulekbayev said the bakiyev regime used to launder investments for such projects through several business structures and transfer them abroad via the central development agency  ( tsarii )  ,  development fund and asiauniversalbank . 
maxim bakiyev  ( the former presidents younger son )  ,  as tsariis head ,  negotiated large credits on behalf of the state ,  attracting investors to kyrgyzstan ,  an anonymous source with the general prosecutors office said . 
that money ended up in the tsarii-controlled development funds bank accounts held with asiauniversalbank and four other large private banks inside the country . 
these funds earn ( ed )  considerable illegal profits for the bakiyev family ,  acting finance minister temir sariyev said . 
the interim government dissolved tsarii and transferred the development fund to state control . 
a new agency will regulate investments . 
to prevent the unlawful outflow of capital ,  several large banks have come under the national banks control ,  and the government said that it now carefully monitors all financial operations . 
at a news conference april <num>12</num>  in bishkek ,  acting first vice-premier almazbek atambayev said moscow has pledged to invest in kyrgyzstan . 
spokesmen for the two largest foreign companies based in kyrgyzstan said they do not see any threat to further co-operation ,  although some apprehension is in the air . 
idinov downplayed that risk . 
larger-scale projects involving foreign capital and loans ,  among them the kumtor gold mine development ,  the hydropower plant construction in the south ,  and the tsarii projects ,  will continue ,  he said . 
the national bank has announced the money exists to finance those projects and that russia is ready to support them ,  which means the process will go on . 
national bank deputy chief zayir chokoyev told journalists april <num>15</num>  that in the first week since the revolution us <num>15</num>  had disappeared from asiauniversalbanks accounts . 
agencies are trying to track down the funds . 
sariyev cited different figures :  of a total of about us <num>15</num>  there ,  us <num>15</num>  was indeed invested in kambar-ata-2 ,  with the rest transferred to the accounts of a number of private banks . 
financial scheme participants also received money directly from investors ,  idinov said . 
large western companies paid the kyrgyz government  ( sometimes up to <num>40</num>  %  )  to work in the republic ,  he said . 
idinov vowed that the government has moved to clear up problems . 
there will be no corruption and business practises will be more transparent . 
these are the conditions that investors need . 
taliban commander lays down arms ,  supports government in northern afghanistan
taliban fighters hand over their weapons as they surrender to the government of herat province in western afghanistan in this <num>2009</num>  file photo . 
mullah adbullah ,  and <num>25</num>  other taliban fighters ,  laid down their arms may <num>19</num>  and now support the government in northern kunduz province . 
 [ majid / getty images ] 
according to local officials ,  mullah abdullah commanded at least <num>25</num>  fighters ,  all of whom have joined the government peace process . 
five of his fighters were recently killed in a coalition force operation ,  local officials told central asia online . 
in a formal ceremony in kunduz ,  mullah abdullah told media he had been fighting against government forces in the imam sahib and gul tapa areas of the province but recently developed differences with the militants over killing innocent people labelled as spies . 
i thought the taliban were fighting to defend the country and the people ,  but i found them murdering innocent people ;  i warned them several times to avoid killing civilians ,  but they did not pay attention and continued terrorising the population ,  he said . 
many times they label innocent villagers as spies and kill them indiscriminately . 
i did not want that . 
so i decided to denounce them and live a peaceful life . 
kunduz is a strategically important province in afghanistans north and has been facing a taliban surge in recent months . 
earlier this week afghan and international forces killed <num>35</num>  taliban fighters ,  including uzbeks and pakistanis ,  in an operation in gul tapa . 
while mullah abdullah denounced the taliban for killing innocent villagers ,  a senior official in the south-eastern ghazni province said insurgents were continuing that campaign in his area . 
the insurgents killed a university student ,  khalil-u-rehman ,  on wednesday ,  along with another resident of ghazni ,  on the charges of spying ,  khial baz shirzai ,  a senior police official in the province ,  told central asia online . 
this week ,  the taliban killed seven innocent villagers on the same charges . 
they have also kidnapped a teacher of sultan shahabuddin ghori high school in ghazni . 
sources said ibrahim visited his village in the shulgar district a few days ago to look at his lands and the militants attacked him during the night and killed him . 
kashagan oil field development could harm health of caspian sea
astana - independent analysts and environmentalists warn that development of the kashagan oil field could end in catastrophe worse than that occurring in the gulf of mexico . 
but oil companies and government officials say they have taken the necessary steps to prevent any problems ,  and are ready to respond to an accident should one occur . 
at stake is <num>30</num> -<num>50</num>  billion barrels of oil . 
efforts to develop kazakhstans largest offshore field have ,  so far ,  cost us <num>27</num>  $  billion . 
production is due to commence in late <num>2012</num>  , reaching <num>75</num>  meter  tonnes annually by <num>2019</num>  , which would make kazakhstan one of the worlds top five oil producers . 
but critics warn of oil spills that could kill the caspian sea . 
plans to drill <num>240</num>  wells at kashagan drive up the risk of pollution ,  said makhambet khakimov ,  director of the ngo kaspiy tabigaty . 
potential oil spills may be far more hazardous than those in the gulf of mexico … where the wells are drilled at a depth of <num>1.5</num>  kilometer  . 
offshore drilling is dangerous to the entire sea ,  warns muftakh diarov ,  a member of the national academy of sciences . 
we have seen the caspian sea polluted with oil products five times over the past few years ,  he said . 
the field is heavily over-pressurised ,  temperatures are high ,  and the  ( hydrogen sulphide )  content is very high . 
diarov recalled an oil blowout at tenghiz in the <num>1990</num>  second  accompanied by a fire that took more than <num>300</num>  days to extinguish . 
it would be impossible to contain such spills ,  and the caspian sea might turn into a highly toxic puddle ,  he said . 
other caspian nations ,  including turkmenistan and iran ,  would lodge legal claims against kazakhstan seeking huge compensation . 
other observers are more sanguine . 
caspeco expert serik akhmetov doubts the certainty of a caspian catastrophe . 
all projects must undergo an environmental impact assessment under kazakhstani law ,  he said . 
kanatbek safinov ,  executive secretary of the oil and gas ministry ,  agreed . 
all corporate users of subsoil resources in kazakhstan have pledged they will do everything to prevent oil spills as a source of potential direct damage to their own assets and have said they are fully aware of the high level of responsibility ,  he said . 
after bps oil well blowout in the gulf of mexico ,  he said ,  prime minister karim masimov required the oil and gas and ecology ministries to submit to government proposals for enhancing oil project safety . 
in that connection ,  his ministry set up a working group to pool efforts with other government agencies shortly in checking the safety of all offshore projects in the caspian ,  he said . 
the north caspian operating company  ( ncoc )  ,  the umbrella organisation for all kashagan project participants )  ,  observes all environmental requirements ,  said philippe charlais ,  company spokesman . 
the consortium has a special unit to contain oil spills ,  with equipment and personnel on standby at several caspian ports to meet any emergency ,  he added . 
drilling techniques in the caspian and the gulf of mexico differ ,  he said . 
in contrast to deep-water drilling in the gulf ,  the  [ offshore caspian ]  drilling and extraction operations are similar to onshore conditions because they will proceed on artificial islands . 
the government decided may <num>18</num>  to create a centre in atyrau to deal with oil spills ,  an oil and gas ministry press release said . 
until we  ( build that centre )  ,  no oil production will be allowed under the law to commence at kashagan ,  oil and gas minister sayat mynbayev said . 
but sceptics say the atyrau plans arent enough . 
khakimov suggested suspending all caspian oil fields currently being developed by kazakhstan . 
they may be re-activated at a time when more reliable drilling and extraction methods have been developed . 
diarov suggested drilling each well more carefully at the cost of reduced projected output . 
this would help to more effectively deal with oil spills <abbr>…</abbr>  due to more-stringent control of production ,  he said . 
galina chernovaya ,  head of the ngo globus ,  said kazakhstani and international drilling laws need to be fixed . 
production-sharing agreements impose all oil spill and fire costs on the kazakhstani side and none on foreign corporations ,  she said . 
the unresolved legal status of disputed caspian sea sectors is a source of numerous questions ,  she added . 
who will be held liable for an oil spill or a fire ? 
talks with iran and turkmenistan have been especially difficult . 
caspeco has proposed a number of draft laws . 
we have worked out and co-ordinated at the expert level two draft protocols to the framework convention for the protection of the marine environment of the caspian sea . 
al-qaeda financial chief and third-in-command mustafa abu al-yazid speaks in an undated video . 
the terrorist organisation confirmed june <num>1</num>  his death several weeks ago . 
the missile strike several weeks ago in north waziristan killed sheikh said al-masri ,  also known as mustafa abu al-yazid ,  and members of his family . 
we have such reports ,  but we are going to further confirm them ,  a senior pakistani administration official who requested anonymity told central asia online . 
pakistani sources have been quoted as saying al-yazid might have died in a may <num>21</num>  missile strike near miramshah ,  north waziristan . 
however ,  other reports put his date of death as may <num>12</num>  .
at least <num>21</num>  people were killed in two drone attacks in north waziristan may <num>21</num>  , while another such strike claimed six lives on may <num>12</num>  .
we are checking into both the attacks ,  as well as other recent incidents ,  and will be in position to confirm when get some evidence ,  a security official working in tribal areas said . 
he added that access to some restive areas in north and south waziristan is not easy and that confirmation of such events takes time . 
al-yazid was reportedly a key financial officer of al-qaeda and was involved in planning and implementing cross-border attacks in afghanistan . 
some reports have stated that his death is likely to hamper al-qaedas fundraising . 
the <num>56</num> -year-old egyptian was associated with islamic movements for nearly three decades . 
he first joined a student group led by ayman al-zawahri ,  said to be osama bin ladens second-in-command . 
kazakhstan trains youths to be traffic police
shymkent -- a gathering of aspiring traffic police officers june <num>1</num> -<num>4</num>  in shymkent and in the tau-samaly schoolchildrens camp in the sairam mountains attracted participants from schools in <num>14</num>  kazakhstani oblasts ,  azerbaijan ,  tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan and russia . 
the number of traffic accidents goes up every year in kazakhstan ,  said saltanat karakozova ,  spokeswoman for the south kazakhstan oblast  ( sko )  department of internal affairs . 
every third victim is a child or teenager . 
children need to learn the rules of the road so that they know how to avoid accidents and how to behave if one occurs ,  she said . 
the event was the tenth such gathering ,  she said ,  adding that teams of elementary school students meet annually nationwide . 
this year ,  the almaty oblast team won ,  receiving a banner that goes to each years winner and the right to host next years contest . 
it was very interesting ;  i especially liked the contest for best reporter ,  said abylai egizbai ,  a member of the winning team . 
its terrible when an accident happens ,  even more when children are involved . 
thats why i decided to become a traffic officer - since our purpose is to never have accidents ! 
it was no easy thing to win ;  all the teams were very well prepared ,  said temirlan tebirov ,  <num>8</num>  , and captain of almaty oblasts team . 
 " but our whole team was focused on winning "  . 
 " for us the most important thing is to explain to children what an important profession this is . 
we'll continue our work "  . 
water for life conference starts in dushanbe
tajik president emomali rakhmon  ( right )  and un under-secretary-general sha zukang  ( left )  prepare to open the water for life conference . 
 [ nazim kalandarov ] 
dushanbe - as an international water resources conference began june <num>8</num>  , tajikistan hoped to use it to garner international support in its feud with uzbekistan over the rogun hydropower project . 
the june <num>8</num> -<num>10</num>  water for life conference is meant to serve as a midterm assessment of progress during the <num>2005</num> -<num>15</num>  water for life international decade for action . 
trans-border water co-operation ,  climate change ,  reducing the risk of natural disasters and integrated administration of water resources are key agenda items . 
more than <num>70</num>  nations and <num>65</num>  un agencies and international organisations are participating in the three-day conference . 
dushanbe hopes to address a full array of central asian water problems ,  said tajik foreign ministry spokesman davlat nazriyev . 
he noted that regional hydropower disputes have worsened relations between some countries . 
an international conference provides a chance to work out new mechanisms in central asia for regulating water disputes concerning the use of trans-border rivers and the peaceful resolution of conflicts with neighbours ,  said kholnazar mukhabbatov ,  a tajik professor and environmentalist . 
noting that in the last <num>50</num>  years there have been <num>35</num>  conflicts over transboundary rivers ,  he pointed to the nile river ,  which ten african countries share ,  as an example of how countries can cooperatively use water resources . 
tajik president emomali rakhmon opened the conference ,  spotlighting access to clean drinking water ,  the depletion of the aral sea and regulation of water use as key concerns . 
we propose building a pipeline from sarez lake . 
this project could guarantee a drinking water supply for millions of central asians ,  he said ,  referring to tajikistans <num>56</num>  kilometer -long lake . 
as for the aral sea ,  rakhmon argued that downstream countries caused the bodys depletion through irrational water use . 
tajikistan has <num>64</num>  billion cubic metres of water ,  he said ,  accounting for <num>60</num>  %  of the river flow feeding the aral sea basin ,  yet it uses only <num>10</num>  %  of the water . 
other countries in the region waste the rest of it ,  he said . 
rakhmon said to conserve water ,  downstream countries should stop growing thirsty crops such as cotton and rice . 
at the same time ,  the tajik president insisted on his countrys right to use their water resources under their own guidance . 
 " no people ,  under any circumstances can ever be deprived of their means of existence "  ,  he said . 
political scientist rustam samiyev said the president was alluding to the tajik-uzbek dispute over the rogun hydroelectric dam . 
uzbekistan has opposed the construction of rogun ,  calling it a threat to its water supply and the environment . 
 " even though rakhmon never mentioned uzbekistan ,  nobody had any doubt that the entire speech concerned tajik-uzbek relations "  ,  he said . 
political scientist abdugani mamadazimov expressed hope that ,  if the conference doesn't solve the tajik-uzbek dispute ,  it can at least soften the uzbek government's position . 
 " using every possibility ,  including this conference ,  tajikistan has the right to insist on continuation of rogun construction "  ,  he said . 
 " we can't go on enduring an energy blockade for half of every year "  . 
 " but since the construction of this particular hydro project has crossed from a technical issue to a political one ,  convincing tashkent to change its position with the help of a single meeting is impossible "  ,  he said . 
at the same time mamadazimov said the region's countries could come to a consensus on the issue of trans-border rivers . 
 " we know of the problems that tajikistan has encountered recently ,  and we emphasise that they need to be resolved through dialogue and co-operation of all central asian countries "  ,  un under-secretary-general sha zukang told journalists . 
a message from un secretary-general ban ki-moon ,  which sha delivered ,  noted that it was essential to improve the system for administering trans-border water resources and that only collective political will could improve cooperation in this regard . 
at a june <num>7</num>  meeting with rakhmon ,  sha said the un was ready to help settle central asian water-use disputes ,  the tajik presidential press service said in a statement . 
the un hopes for a peaceful resolution of the tajik-uzbek dispute but doesn't have any leverage over tashkent ,  said kori udovicki ,  director of the un development programme regional bureau for europe and cis . 
 " i don't think this conference can be fundamental in the two countries' hydropower relations "  ,  samiyev said . 
 " most likely ,  they'll limit themselves to expressing the desire to solve all problems through negotiations "  . 
rogun dam dominates water conference
dushanbe - tensions between uzbekistan and tajikistan over the rogun hydropower project dominated the water for life conference . 
the confrontation came as the international conference assessing the <num>2005</num> -<num>2015</num>  water for life international decade for action closed . 
in a concluding declaration ,  participants recognised the need for the un to achieve an agreement on all questions connected to water ,  tajik prime minister akil akilov said . 
water ,  as a renewable energy source ,  is essential for the production of electricity ,  while electricity is essential for the distribution of water ,  as well as for that of other essential services to the population ,  the participants concluded . 
the conference was only able to approve an abbreviated declaration ,  as the uzbek delegation insisted on revisions to four points in the declaration and threatened to withhold its signature if the changes were not made ,  said one uzbek delegate . 
the source did not identify which points offended the uzbeks . 
however ,  this was not the only ultimatum the uzbek delegation issued . 
on the eve of a special session titled harnessing the hydroelectric potential of tajikistan and its significance for solving the hydro-energy problems of central and southern asia ,  a heated discussion about roguns construction arose . 
uzbekistan calls rogun a threat to its water supply and the environment . 
construction of rogun doesnt meet safety standards ,  claimed galina sandova ,  uzbek first deputy minister of economics . 
we need scientifically confirmed written guarantees that the dam will be reliable ,  sandova said . 
tajikistan must give safety guarantees to all peoples populating central asia . 
uzbekistan will agree to the construction of this facility if a technical and environmental assessment of the project gives positive results and if the world bank - not tajikistan - pays for the study ,  analysis and publication ,  the uzbek delegation said . 
we insist on a truly independent study . 
uzbekistans claims are groundless ,  replied tajik industry and energy minister gul sherali . 
tajikistan has already conducted many studies of this facility and will do so again in the future to prove to uzbekistan the rightfulness of building the rogun hydropower station . 
we are blood brothers ,  and we have more than once invited uzbekistan in writing ,  as a fraternal state ,  to participate in the consortium for building rogun ,  sherali said . 
upstream and downstream countries need to have equal access to water resources ,  daryl fields ,  a senior water resources specialist for the world bank ,  said . 
tajikistan needs to use its uranium and coal supplies as well as water ,  she said . 
concerning rogun ,  she noted that the bank would hold consultations with neighbouring countries on the results of expert studies to explain the soundness of the banks findings . 
but its obvious that neither the conference itself nor special sessions conducted during the conference would have satisfied the uzbek delegation ,  said tajik delegate viktor dubovitsky . 
of course ,  during the meeting ,  we saw various interesting and positive proposals for monitoring water ,  improving the legislative basis  ( of water policy )  ,  and for coining terminology ,  but all of these are private issues that cannot fully satisfy the demands of the central asian countries ,  he said . 
i dont see any movement for our region on this matter ,  although itll become clearer in a year . 
right now theres enough tension between the different countries that i dont see how to solve it . 
the uzbek leadership is more concerned that it could end up with an economically stronger neighbor ,  since once tajikistan acquires energy independence ,  itll start to conduct independent policies ,  dubovitsky added . 
tensions between the two countries were visible outside the conference hall too . 
about <num>20</num>  tajik journalists picketed the uzbek embassy june <num>9</num>  to protest the continued impoundment of more about <num>2,500</num>  tajik-bound railway freight cars . 
tajikistan says the railcars have been impounded to delay construction of rogun ,  while uzbekistan says technical issues have stranded the cars . 
uzbek and tajik presidents are meeting this week to discuss rogun in tashkent . 
uzbek border guards block the only passageway to the kazakh village of arnasai . 
uzbeks have been blocking the village since june <num>7</num>  .
 [ timur nazarov ] 
arnasai ,  kazakhstan - hundreds of arnasai residents have lived under a blockade by uzbek border guards since june <num>7</num>  and the village has run out of food and drinking-water supplies . 
its only access to the skos southern district capitals  ( zhetysai and shardara )  is a road along the reservoir . 
uzbek border guards blocked the road june <num>7</num>  and have since not let anybody pass . 
the villagers can only communicate through cell phones . 
an uzbek border guard told central asia online his unit received orders to step up security in connection with the june <num>10</num> -<num>11</num>  shanghai co-operation organisation summit in tashkent . 
earlier ,  we never felt at all that we lived in another state ,  arnasai resident ospan asanov said by phone . 
we had no problem going to zhetysai and shardara ;  wed pick up groceries and drinking water . 
many families are running out of food . 
we can get water from the shardarin reservoir ,  but its salty . 
khametov said arnasai residents in the late <num>1990</num>  second  received an offer of <num>900,000</num>  kzt  ( us <num>6,000</num>  $  )  in compensation to move to kazakhstani territory ,  but most chose to stay . 
we want to stay on our own soil ,  where our ancestors lived ,  and where our fathers graves are ,  asanov said . 
the compensation was completely inadequate for setting up house in a new place . 
kazakhstani journalists train at the north kazakhstan media centre . 
 [ kapiza nurtazina ] 
astana -- independent media face falling revenues in kazakhstan as professional reporters leave local outlets for lucrative government jobs . 
while government-supported media have been earning ever more ,  the independent outlets declining incomes have been putting brakes on their development ,  askar shomshekov of the pavlodar-based regional journalism centre said . 
regional media have only themselves to blame for advertising and sales shortfalls ,  he said . 
most of them have been doing nothing to adapt their business strategies to the changing market environment ,  shomshekov said . 
sergey mirolyubov ,  the owner of nasha gazeta in kostanai and president of the newspaper editors association ,  blamed the financial crisis . 
advertising revenues have fallen several dozen percent everywhere in my newspaper ,  to <num>50</num> -<num>60</num>  %  of what we earned at the end of <num>2008</num>  , he said . 
the lack of funding has negatively affected the level of staff professionalism ,  he said . 
the social dynamics of small villages can also impede professional reporting ,  according to astana-based reporter gulnar mukhanova . 
regional media reporters live next door to the characters of their publications and see those people every day ,  he said . 
therefore ,  publications can be very loyal there . 
pro-government newspapers carry mostly positive reports and eulogies ,  and the independent media tend to feature more criticism to attract the readers attention . 
but fear of reprisal for criticism undermines the quality of publications ,  mukan noted . 
so russian glamour magazines are generally more popular in the regions than local newspapers ,  he said . 
national media reported on more than <num>2,000</num>  instances of corruption in <num>2008</num>  , versus <num>400</num>  in regional media ,  according to transparency kazakhstan . 
the relevant ratio of negative publications was <num>200</num>  to <num>50</num>  and of positive ones - about <num>100</num>  to <num>10</num>  .
the regional media face challenges but still has the potential to grow ,  vice-minister of communications and information nurai orazov said . 
the communications and information minister met with regional representatives in april ,  he said . 
based on the problems identified and suggestions voiced ,  the ministry is currently working on a special plan of regional media development ,  orazov said . 
the plan will be implemented with assistance from the regional akimats ,  the municipal administrations of almaty and astana ,  the ministry of education and science ,  and the finance ministry . 
he said the regional media receive government subsidies and have grown in number to <num>1,876</num>  from <num>1,172</num>  since <num>2006</num>  .
training programmes for regional reporters ,  newspaper managers and media designers have been offered by the osce ,  internews ,  foreign embassies and the regional media support centre . 
but journalists maintain that independence from the government is more important than training . 
i dont see any prospect for the industrys advancement as long as the media remain state-controlled ,  dina medvednikova of the north kazakhstani media centre said . 
urnaliyev said the local authorities must stop controlling the media and thereby hampering their progress . 
tajik border guards patrol the tajik-uzbek border in sogd oblast . 
some uzbeks and tajiks no longer want their children to marry citizens of the neighbouring country because of border problems . 
khudzhand ,  tajikistan - cross-border tajik-uzbek marriages persist despite documentation problems and growing interethnic tensions . 
executive authorities in tajikistans sogd oblast registered <num>1,640</num>  marriages  ( about <num>45</num>  %  of the total )  between tajik citizens and those of other cis countries ,  mostly uzbekistan ,  between <num>2003</num>  and june <num>2009</num>  .
more than <num>30</num>  %  of all marriages in uzbekistans namangan oblast are with citizens of tajikistan ,  regional executive government officials said . 
marriage registration between a tajik citizen and a foreigner requires written consent from the parents of the bride and groom ,  a certificate that the foreigner has no spouse in the home country ,  the tajik foreign ministrys authorisation of the marriage ,  a copy of the foreigners passport ,  and a document from the tajik migration service certifying that the foreigner is a legal alien on sogd oblast territory ,  khudzhand marriage centre director makhfirat takhira said . 
all the documents except the latter one are to be translated into tajik and certified by a notary . 
international marriages are equally difficult to register in uzbekistan ,  uzbek divorce lawyer abdulloh khakimov said . 
registration requires a certificate of the foreigners non-married status ,  a copy of the registrants passport ,  a migration service certificate of legality ,  a medical examination certificate ,  and an aids and tb test . 
usually ,  studying the documents takes about a month ,  but in the event of an international marriage ,  it may be dragged out for half a year ,  khakimov said . 
…ive had several clients whose marriage registration applications were turned down . 
most uzbek-tajik marriages have been registered in the spitamen district of tajikistan that borders uzbekistans bekabad ,  kushtegirmon zhamoat  ( council )  chairman shavkat kadyrov said . 
many uzbeks and tajiks lived in what are now border areas in soviet times when there were no frontiers ,  he said . 
today ,  a brother living in uzbekistan may have his daughter marry the son of another brother who lives in tajikistan ,  he said . 
if relatives go to see one another ,  they dont have to obtain a visa -  [ they ]  just register at the frontier checkpoint . 
the visa-free regime between uzbekistan and tajikistan is only for people with diplomatic or service passports and for residents of the border areas whose border-crossing authorization is only valid for <num>5</num>  days ,  according to their respective foreign ministries . 
a multiple visa costs us <num>4</num>  $  for <num>30</num>  days ,  us <num>10</num>  $  for six months and us <num>20</num>  $  for one year . 
a woman from tajikistans spitamen district said she has had problems ever since she married an uzbek citizen from bekabad four years ago . 
the marriage was solemnised in accordance with the muslim rite but not officially registered in bekabad . 
the family lives in uzbekistan ,  but they only succeeded in registering their marriage in tajikistan ,  where the childrens birth certificates were issued despite their birth in uzbekistan . 
local residents said they no longer want their daughters to marry uzbek citizens because of the many problems . 
but sobit karimov ,  a registry office clerk from namangan oblast ,  blamed tajikistan for registration problems . 
if one of the newlyweds is an uzbek citizen ,  there will be no problem registering their marriage or issuing birth certificates to their children . 
on the contrary ,  we have had many such couples complaining they were denied registration in tajikistan ,  she said . 
according to officials at border zhamoats in sogd oblast of tajikistan ,  registering marriages with citizens of uzbekistan presents no special problem . 
and even after years of marriage ,  citizenship is not guaranteed . 
weve had this headache for <num>18</num>  months now ,  she said . 
i cross the border every five days and then go back . 
sometimes i have to stand in line at the checkpoint for hours under the scorching sun or in the cold wind ,  and hear border guards nagging and swearing at me . 
the army launched ground and air offensives against militants of tehrik - i - taliban in pakistan last october . 
all road networks and major population centres are in full control of the army and  ( it )  is now in the process of consolidating its positions and stabilizing the trouble tribal territory ,  abbas told central asia online in an exclusive interview december <num>14</num>  .
talking about the military operation in the south waziristan tribal agency ,  abbas said that after clearing the area of ttp militants ,  the pakistan military is consolidating its positions and stabilizing the affected areas . 
simultaneously ,  he said ,  the military has also started air and ground offensives in neighbouring orakzai and kurram tribal agencies where most of the militants from waziristan reportedly have taken refuge . 
there are still areas yet to be cleared from militants . 
… militants have no place to settle and plan . 
they are dispersed and are on the run in search of safe places to hide as movement in the whole area is in the control of military . 
militants are either killed or have deserted their hideouts and main population centres ,  he said
abbas added ,  now ,  the military is ready for conducting snap raids against their hideouts and is actively chasing them in the countryside and mountains . 
the main purpose of a snap operation is to stop guerrillas attacks on military and local population once they are back to their homes from idps centres . 
even after clearing and stabilizing the whole area ,  the army will stay in south waziristan agency for security for the local tribes . 
the army launched a full scale military operation against the hard-core militants ,  loosely united under the umbrella of hakimullah mehsud-led ttp ,  october <num>17</num>  .
the military claims to have killed almost <num>600</num>  militants ,  while more than eighty army personnel have died during the two months of fighting . 
more than <num>30,000</num>  ground troops were backed by pakistani air force jet fighters and helicopter gunships in locating and targeting the militants hideouts . 
discussing the defeat of the militants and the success of the security forces ,  abbas said ,  first ,  militants were not supported by the local tribes - either mehsuds or wazirs . 
the tribal people were made hostage by the militants ,  who include both locals and foreigners . 
the success of the military operation was due to several reasons ,  he said ,  the first is the strong support of local people for the operation . 
besides ,  the pakistan army used a very unconventional strategy ;  the military first occupied the ridges and mountaintops and then started using the normal roads for onward movement . 
additionally ,  pakistan army night vision capability played a decisive role . 
pakistan used its home-made small predators fitted with night vision cameras and communication systems for observing activities of militants at night time . 
as for the new military operations in orakzai and kurram ,  abbas said :  already the military has started air and ground offensives on militants hideouts in kurram and orakzai tribal agencies . 
likewise in orakzai ,  the military has targeted several hideouts of militants with jet fighters . 
even ground offensives have been started at the ferozkhel locality of orakzai . 
in orakzai ,  people have vacated their homes and villages for safer places ,  from those areas where militants are reportedly gathering and taking refuge . 
the good news is that local maliks and influential people are extending support to the government and military . 
through telephonic intercepts ,  we have the information that some tribal elders have denied help to hakimullah mehsud and his colleagues in their territories . 
the military has cleared the peshawar-parachinar road for public transport . 
likewise ,  a large-scale operation is going on simultaneously in the khyber agency against militants of mangal bagh . 
abbas said that once the military fully stabilizes the south waziristan agency ,  a targeted operation will be launched in orakzai and kurram . 
asked about when internally displaced people  ( idps )  can expect to return home ,  he said it will still take some time ,  and the displaced will be allowed to return home when the area is fully cleared of militants . 
as for the future ,  abbas said unequivocally :  the pakistan government strategy is to bring the whole tribal area under its writ . 
the success of the military operations in swat and waziristan against the militants will have a much bigger impact even across the border ,  abbas said . 
once the government establishes its writ and brings the whole tribal areas under control ,  then nobody could challenge its writ here .

the institute to study civil society ,  in conjunction with <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  legal experts and the uzbekistan ministry of justice ,  has conducted an international seminar in tashkent on legal rights and detention . 
prisoners stand in a defendants cage during the reading of the court verdict in tashkent ,  <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
<num>14</num>  , <num>2005</num> 
representatives from the uzbek parliament ,  the supreme court ,  the general prosecutors office ,  the ministry of internal affairs ,  the institute for monitoring existing laws under the president of the republic of uzbekistan ,  the national centre for human rights ,  the uzbekistan association of barristers ,  the tashkent state law institute ,  and ombudsmen and experts from the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  took part in the seminar . 
a teacher from the university of rouen  ( france )  ,  philippe guyot ,  stated ,  i can say with certainty that ,  in uzbekistan ,  safeguarding human rights is developing in the right direction ,  along with the establishment of democratic and public institutions . 
the most important thing is to ensure the supremacy of the law . 
this conference is presenting a good opportunity to exchange opinions ,  proposals ,  and recommendations . 
safeguarding human rights is a prolonged and ever developing process . 
in particular it took centuries for france to be recognised as a democratic country .

the main purpose of the seminar was to review questions connected with the present status and prospects for the development of the judiciary and legal system in uzbekistan . 
the country will soon enforce the laws concerned with the transfer to the courts of the right to sanction detention ,  and the abolition of the death penalty . 
it was noted in particular at the seminar that one of the worlds most humane and liberal systems of criminal penalties has been created in uzbekistan . 
within the framework of the measures realised to liberalise the criminal penalties system ,  about <num>75</num>  percent of crimes have been removed from the category of serious and especially serious and moved to the category of crimes that do not entail great public danger or to the category of less serious . 
at the same time ,  note was made at the seminar of the inadequate work of the relevant structures in the field of safeguarding human rights and the individual . 
the countrys government intends to correct this situation for the better . 
accordingly ,  in order to improve the effectiveness and objectiveness of studies concerning the activity of the appropriate subdivisions in the law enforcement structures ,  <num>17</num>  working groups have been created to organise work at the centre and at the local level . 
along with officers from the national human rights institutions ,  they will be made up of more than <num>140</num>  experts ,  specialists ,  and legal scholars . 
terrorism takes a toll on survivors ,  too
her family is still waiting for government compensation because basheer was not on the original list of terror victims . 
 [ abdul nasir khan ] 
i am already striving hard to continue the schooling of my two sons ali raza  ( <num>9</num>  )  and bilal  ( <num>7</num>  )  ,  nazia said in an interview with central asia online . 
nazia is facing all this after her husband muhammad basheer fell victim to terrorism . 
he was one of those who died in a suicide bombing of the police emergency and inter services intelligence  ( isi )  buildings in lahore on may <num>27</num>  .
muhammad nazeer ,  father of basheer ,  recalled the tragic day . 
basheer was the only child of his father ,  who - now old and ill - cannot work to feed his daughter-in-law and three grandchildren . 
nazia said the government had announced a deal to pay rs <num>300,000</num>   ( us <num>3,588</num>  $  )  compensation to the families of every civilian who died in that incident ,  but she is still waiting for the money . 
her father-in-law got sick and tired of visiting government offices to get the compensation because nobody seemed to care . 
the mqm heard the news and visited the family ,  and donated rs <num>10,000</num>   ( us <num>119</num>  $  )  to them . 
although we are hand-to-mouth now ,  i am running my familys affairs . 
basheers family is not the only one suffering from all this . 
dozens of other families face similar miseries . 
according to police ,  <num>13</num>  incidents of terrorism have taken place in lahore since january <num>2008</num>  , claiming <num>146</num>  lives and maiming dozens of others . 
where one sees innocent people like basheer dying ,  one also finds bereaved families ,  still in agony ,  trying to learn who killed their loved ones - terrorists or security officials . 
for instance ,  terrorists attacked the federal investigation agencys  ( fia )  regional headquarters in lahore on october <num>15</num>  .
closed-circuit television footage of this attack has been aired by various private channels . 
a bank officer named zaheer afzal ,  <num>39</num>  , died in the incident . 
talking to central asia online ,  bilal said he is in constant search of zaheers real killer . 
zaheer was shot at by any of the security guards present inside the fia building bilal said . 
bilal has tried to get the authorities to tell him the facts about zaheers death instead of giving compensation to his family ,  but officials have not answered his questions . 
will it compensate our sorrows ,  or will it fill the place of a father ,  a husband ,  a son ,  bilal asked . 
we want to know who killed my zaheer ,  and thats all . 
zaheers death is enigma . 
his <num>11</num> -year-old son rehan still holds out hope that his father will come and play cricket with him . 
he is too young to understand that his father has gone forever . 
two or three cases of compensations are pending due to disputes among the family members of the victims ,  he said . 
we have also paid compensation to families of  ( all )  civilians killed in terrorist attack in lahore ,  lahore executive district officer tariq zaman says . 
basheer was not on the list of victims when it was prepared soon after the attack ,  as we could not find his body ,  tariq said . 
it has been confirmed after many days of the attack that basheer was also a victim of terrorism ,  and we have asked the provincial government for the compensation ,  but were still waiting for any response . 
police and onlookers gather on the mall road after a suicide attack december <num>24</num>  .
the pakistan international airlines building was believed to be the target of the attack . 
 [ abdullah jan ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan ,  -- five people were killed and another <num>25</num>  were injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up on the busy mall road area in peshawar december <num>24</num>  , police said . 
those killed in the blast included a police constable ,  gul nawaz ,  who stopped the bomber before he was able to reach some government buildings at the mall . 
peshawar police chief liaqat ali told reporters the suicide attacker was heading to the offices of pakistan international airlines  [ pia ]  . 
once again a cop wrote history by avoiding mass causalities ,  liaqat said . 
another police officer gave his life to save the lives of dozens of journalists inside the peshawar press club ,  december <num>22</num>  .
police chief liaqat said two bombers executed the mall road attack . 
many government and private buildings are on the mall road . 
district coordination officer  [ dco ]  of peshawar sahibzada mohammad anis said the nearby crowded jinnah street or saddar road could have been the suicide attackers target . 
police said if the attacker had entered any of the installations ,  many people would have died . 
at least three women were among the injured . 
they included minhaj bibi ,  naheed bibi and sobia . 
the wounded were rushed to the nearby combined military hospital  [ cmh ]  and lady reading hospital  [ lrh ]  . 
hospital sources said four of the injured were in critical condition ,  while most were released after being treated . 
syed zahir shah ,  health minister of north west frontier province ,  expressed his optimism about early success of army operation against militants in tribal areas . 
killing of taliban commander called significant
mingora ,  pakistan -- the pakistan military said the killing of a senior taliban commander in the swat valley december29 is significant to the effort of restoring the central governments writ in the region . 
his killing comes as a major blow to militancy in swat and we believe it a great success for the security forces ,  mushtaq said . 
abu zar supervised ied  ( improvised explosive device )  attacks and allegedly drove taliban-linked terror through the streets of swat ,  local residents and the military spokesman said . 
local media reported that the taliban commander was captured sometime back in dargai ,  a town in the malakand region in the provincially- administered tribal areas . 
however ,  the military said he was killed when he encountered security forces during a search operation in charbagh . 
the military launched operation rah-e-rast  ( operation right path )  last may after the mullah fazlullah-led taliban took over the valley weeks after reaching a peace deal with the provincial government in peshawar ,  capital of north west frontier province ,  in february . 
this man was responsible for improvised explosive device attacks on security forces and beheading some <num>25</num>  innocent civilians whose only crime was they were opposing taliban-style justice . 
so ,  you can imagine how important it was to take out this threat ,  mushtaq said . 
swat today presents a different situation as the states writ has been restored to more than <num>90</num>  percent of the area . 
peace-seeking group grows in tandem with violence
women march along a peshawar street to denounce the taliban-linked militancy and demand peace in north west frontier province  [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- a terrorist strikes in the north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  . 
hours later ,  or maybe the next day ,  floral wreaths lie at the site or a candlelit procession is held . 
these once-anonymous outpourings of grief are growing as the number of bombings and suicide attacks increases in the nwfp . 
amn tehrik is a conglomerate of civil society ,  non-governmental organizations ,  progressive and liberal political forces . 
after a peace deal with pro-taliban leader maulana sufi muhammad ,  head of the banned tehreek nifaz-e-shariah muhamamdi  ( movement for enforcement of shariah of muhammad )  ,  failed to stop the militancy from spreading ,  amn tehrik was launched on april <num>24</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
no to terrorism and yes for peace on pukhtoon land is its single-point agenda . 
the platform allows liberal and democratic pashtun forces to stand up against the militancy . 
the amn tehrik injected new blood into an otherwise despondent civilian population . 
when i came here ,  what i found among the general public and government officials was despondency ,  and it was worrying ,  nwfp governor owais ahmed ghani said several times news while meeting journalists . 
analysts say the previous government of right-wing muttahida majlis-e-amal  ( mma )  was very poor in mobilizing the public against the militancy . 
that encouraged the militants to extend their areas of influence beyond the waziristan border . 
the role of civil society in pakistan has generally been shadowy as the state was patronizing islamic parties that once suppressed such liberal and democratic voices . 
shabeena ayaz ,  resident director of the womens advocacy group aurat foundation ,  said ,  there has never been such an organized civil society before . 
and she said that the swat takeover by the taliban was a wake-up call for residents to join hands in the struggle against the militancy in the pashtun land . 
we want to show the world the cultural heritage of the pukhtoon nation and make the world believe the pukhtoons are peace-loving people . 
now ,  this western gesture appears to have been gradually accepted by politicians and government officials who placed a floral wreath at the peshawar press club after a suicide attack december <num>22</num>  .
we had a few people in the beginning and today our strength is very good ,  he told central asia online . 
this movement provides a platform to raise a collective voice against terrorism . 
earlier ,  there was no such platform . 
amn tehrik may not stop bombings and suicide attacks ,  but it is mobilizing the public . 
former federal information minister nisar memon said ,  you can defeat terrorism by staying together and expressing solidarity with terror victims . 
pottery villages of peshawar
awal khan ,  <num>7</num>  , works on a traditional wheel to make pottery . 
 [ abdullah jan ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- haji abdul janabs fingers work magic with the wet clay spinning on a wheel as he shapes it into pottery . 
eighty-year-old janab is a resident of musazai near peshawar in northwestern pakistan . 
janab is not the only skilled potter in his family . 
he passed along his expertise to his four sons and three daughters . 
more than a dozen grandchildren are also learning ,  carrying on the family tradition . 
pottery is source of livelihood for janab and over <num>500</num>  other residents of musazai and nearby surizai ,  locally referred to as kulalano killi - the potters villages . 
more than a hundred families have lived in the two villages for over a century . 
they are believed to have descended from a small group of ancestors ,  and are ,  in fact ,  all related . 
their great-grandfathers settled in the two villages long ago ,  said javed khan ,  an elected representative from musazai . 
women folk in the two villages also learn and practice pottery . 
anabs <num>5</num> -year-old granddaughter shumaila is a pottery student ,  learning the skill from her father and other older family members . 
she has just started using the potters wheel to make khazana ,  ceramic coin banks for children . 
her delicate fingers are fast learning to form figures out of the wet clay . 
we work in our houses and our kids learn through seeing ,  explained shumailas father mukhtar khan ,  who received his training from his father and uncles . 
potters of musazai and surizai do not marry outside their extended families . 
a potters daughter becomes a potters wife after marriage . 
young boys bring earth from the nearby fields and mix it with water and sand to make the clay . 
i go to school in the morning and help my parents afterwards ,  said a young boy ,  muslim khan . 
women in the families help in cleaning the earth and making the clay indoors . 
then ,  more experienced and talented family members work on potters wheels to form the pottery . 
the pottery is then removed from the wheel and placed in the sun to dry . 
afterwards ,  the pottery is fired in kilns at high temperature to fully harden it . 
there are some in each family who handle marketing the final product ,  bargaining with wholesalers that come from around the country to buy the finished product . 
potter janab still remembers his childhood ,  when his father used to take pottery to other villages . 
gone are the days when we had pottery lovers in pakistan ,  laments abdul rauf seemab ,  <num>80</num>  , who runs a pottery shop in peshawar . 
seemabs forefathers had set up pottery factories in peshawars shah wali qatal street in the early 20t century . 
but the pottery factories closed down when business slumped a few decades back . 
modernization proved a blow to pottery business in this part of the world . 
now potters in the two villages have switched over to flower pots ,  water pitchers and small decoration pieces . 
while the potters of musazai and surizai have survived and adapted to changing tastes ,  the present security situation in peshawar and elsewhere in pakistan has dealt another blow to business . 
tawabs sales were cut almost in half during <num>2009</num>  , when peshawar witnessed more than two dozen bomb blasts . 
punjabi taliban ,  fact or fiction ? 
pakistani military helicopters fly over the area of an attack at the entrance of the pakistani army headquarters in rawalpindi october <num>10</num>  .
all four attackers were killed . 
 [ farooq naeem / afp / getty images ] 
during the recent terrorist attacks in various punjab cities--especially on the military general headquarters  ( ghq )  october <num>10</num>  in rawalpindi ,  a new term was introduced in the media :  punjabi taliban . 
the attack last march on the sri lankan cricket team in lahore is regarded as the first terrorist activity by the punjabi taliban . 
the group also claimed responsibility for the attack on the inter services intelligence  ( isi )  agency buildings and police emergency <num>15</num>  agency last <abbr>may.</abbr> 
nek muhammad ,  alias zubair ,  was later arrested and confirmed that aqeel was the mastermind of the attacks . 
aqeel was later arrested in connection with the attack on ghq in rawalpindi . 
the term punjabi taliban is largely used for those involved in terrorist attacks in punjab province . 
but questions arise as to who the punjabi taliban are ,  what group they are associated with ,  and whether their organization is based in punjab . 
these individuals fought with the taliban in afghanistan and many of them were trained in pakistans tribal area ,  professor and pakistani analyst hasan askari rizvi said . 
some banned religious outfits are ideological coherents of taliban in punjab ,  and they are the main supporters and facilitators of terrorism and suicide bombers in punjab . 
rizvi ,  views punjabi taliban as a term that is applied to a variety of groups ,  but said there is no formal organization in punjab . 
punjabi taliban is the group of individuals who mainly belong to sectarian groups and banned organisations that have ideological coherence with taliban ,  he said . 
the fighters from pakistan ,  irrespective of their home province ,  were called the punjabi taliban ,  ashrafi said . 
there is no formal set up of punjabi taliban in pakistan or in punjab ,  but the fighters fled from afghanistan after us-led forces invaded the country . 
they entered pakistans tribal area and regrouped with the local taliban ;  then their sympathizers from different parts of pakistan joined them ,  ashrafi said . 
i am confident that neither the taliban nor any jihadic organization can occupy any part of punjab . 
according to punjab police ,  a number of former jihadi activists who have close contacts with terrorists have been arrested . 
punjabs law minister rana sana ullah says ,  we have a list of former jihadists and we monitor their activities ,  but a lot of them are missing ,  he said . 
we dont have any threat regarding talibanization in punjab . 
they work individually and we are after them ,  but they cant capture an inch of punjabs territory ,  he said . 
life is difficult at pakistans jalozai camp for displaced persons
a young girl fetches water from the water tank in the jalozai camp for internally displaced persons . 
nowshera ,  pakistan -- warmth ,  food and medical care . 
things many people take for granted are not so easy to come by if you have fled your home in pakistan . 
the sprawling jalozai camp ,  divided into <num>14</num>  sections on a dusty plain in the nowshera district ,  <num>30</num>  kilometres east of peshawar ,  is home to some <num>139,000</num>  people displaced from the bajaur ,  mohmand and khyber tribal regions of pakistans federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  that border afghanistan . 
some <num>14,000</num>  people ,  mostly from the bajaur agency ,  were shifted to jalozai from the katcha garhi camp near peshawar last year . 
this was part of a government policy to concentrate the idps in a few big camps for better security and care . 
some <num>60</num>  families from the swat district have also relocated to jalozai after having lived in three different camps since the militarys offensive against the taliban militants in may last year . 
the jalozai camp sprang up in the early <num>1980</num>  second  when afghans fleeing the soviet invasion of neighbouring afghanistan settled there . 
the camp had barely closed in early <num>2009</num>  after repatriating many afghan refugees and relocating others before a need was felt to accommodate displaced pakistanis . 
shaukat khan afridi ,  acting camp administrator ,  said scarcity of funds is the major challenge . 
we barely manage to look after these people as they are so many and we have nothing to give ,  he said . 
fazal karim ,  <num>65</num>  , from bara in the khyber agency ,  lives with his three daughters and two sons in one tent . 
although he was satisfied with the food rations ,  he said there were not enough blankets . 
we cover the children with three blankets to keep them warm ,  but they cry at night because of the cold ,  she said . 
jamalas neighbour in the adjacent tent wasnt satisfied with the quantity of food or the medical facilities . 
the world food program  ( wfp )  distributes food packages at the camp monthly . 
each package consists of <num>40</num>  kg of flour ,  <num>8</num>  kg of lentils ,  <num>4</num>  kg of sugar ,  <num>5</num>  litres of cooking oil ,  <num>1</num>  kg of salt ,  <num>300</num>  grams of tea and <num>4</num>  kg of high energy biscuits for children ,  wfp spokesman amjad khan told central asia online . 
life could get a lot easier if the same amount of food was distributed fortnightly rather than monthly ,  kandaharo said . 
the world health organisation  ( who )  runs basic health units  ( bhus )  in the camp . 
they provide basic healthcare ,  but lack emergency or specialized medical services . 
i miss my village . 
it is beautiful . 
i pray that the war ends soon so that i can go back ,  abdul said . 
abdul said he and his brother sajjad ,  <num>3</num>  , cannot sleep at night because of the cold . 
the chilly weather makes sajjad cry and makes it even more difficult for me to sleep due to the noise ,  he said . 
i dont know if the war will ever end and my family will return home ,  she said dejectedly . 
some parents complained about the jalozai schools . 
eight schools are in the camp but zarina ,  <num>10</num>  , said she has to walk <num>40</num>  minutes each way to school . 
i walk to school in the morning when it is very cold . 
i am very hungry and tired when the school finishes and then have to walk back to our tent ,  she said . 
assessment and tent pitching for setting up a school in phase <num>8</num>  of the camp is on-going . 
due to the influx of displaced persons ,  unicef will establish six new schools in the remaining sections of the camp ,  he said . 
madrassas begin education on family planning
students attend class at the madrassa jamai-e-naeemia in lahore . 
militant members of the taliban oppose family planning ,  but some madrassas educate students on that topic . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore ,  pakistan -- art and islam are coming together to help control the population explosion in pakistan . 
maulana raghib naeemi ,  chief administrator of jamai-e-naeemia ,  uses islamic arguments to advance the idea that family planning and reproductive health programs are fundamentally approved by islam . 
family planning is not sinful and anti-islamic . 
islam permits family planning and birth spacing  ( because )  frequent childbirths harm a mothers health ,  he said . 
pakistans population increased to <num>144</num>  meter  in <num>2001</num>  from <num>34</num>  meter  in <num>1951</num>  .
if that growth rate continues ,  pakistans population will reach <num>220</num>  meter  by <num>2020</num>  .
to counter the myths surrounding family planning and to raise awareness about it ,  the ministry of population development  ( mpd )  has involved religious scholars and graduates of local madrassas in its plans to link population control to islamic philosophy . 
the majority of ulema in pakistan perceive family planning as a way to limit the number of children ,  a policy that they say goes against islam . 
ghazali also noted economic reasons for family planning ,  such as the wish to limit ones family to a manageable size . 
naeemi said couples should jointly decide how many children they want and when . 
another valid reason for practicing contraception in islam is the well-being of children . 
the presence of a nursing infant is a major reason for birth control . 
he quoted the quran to show that it implicitly supports spacing childrens births several years apart :  and mothers shall suckle their children two full years to complete breast feeding . 
the ministry has also begun a program of selecting ulema to go to villages and rural areas to spread the message about the benefits of using medical and scientific know-how to control family size . 
the government is determined to make the most of the authority enjoyed by religious segments in the society ,  amid the projected surge in the population to <num>202.1</num>  meter  by <num>2023</num>  , said tahir raza naqvi ,  the population welfare department  ( pwd )  secretary of punjab . 
the ministry has already engaged <num>22,800</num>  ulema and imams of various mosques in its scheme of public counseling vis-a-vis family planning . 
religious scholars  ( need to )  find ways <abbr>…</abbr>  to convince the ordinary people ,  particularly in rural areas ,  that birth control through scientific means is lawful and permitted by islam ,  he said . 
grass-roots level education <abbr>…</abbr>  on limiting family sizes by the governments has already begun . 
the ministry of public welfare also has been using art to provide information ,  education and communication  ( iec )  about family planning . 
the unfpa allocated us$14 , 783 to pwd punjab during <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  for art and promotional activities designed to help curb population growth . 
counseling and information on population and family ,  along with art and literary performances on controlling population growth ,  are conducted to raise awareness and understanding about the relevance of population-related issues to all levels of decision-making ,  said naqvi . 
iec programmes  [ rely on ]  good interpersonal communication and counseling skills ,  particularly within the context of family planning and other healthcare services . 
iec efforts have found play by pwd in a wide range of communications channels ,  ranging from one-on-one counseling to the mass media ,  traditional folk arts and public forums . 
communications strategy tools are a vital means of inculcating awareness among the population ,  said naqvi . 
art activities can be very important where literacy is low or where written information is not widely circulated . 
iec programmes are an important vehicle for reaching young people ,  while less formal education on population issues can take place in the workplace ,  health facilities ,  trade unions ,  community centres ,  youth groups ,  mosques and womens organisations and through vocational training ,  literacy programmes and art activities ,  he said . 
eunuchs in pakistan want laws against harassment

eunuchs in pakistan complain of official and unofficial discrimination . 
 [ hasan khan ] 
she requested non-disclosure of her childhood first name . 
besides asking parliament to formulate new laws ,  she appealed to chief justice iftikhar chaudhry  ( no relation )  to take notice of discrimination in the countrys constitution . 
it confers no protection on the third sex against harassment and intimidation . 
the supreme court ruled in shazias favour after she filed a case . 
she appeared before the court to plead for equal rights and elimination of discrimination against eunuchs . 
senior advocate aslam khaki represented the eunuchs in the supreme court . 
the court issued a verdict june <num>6</num>  directing the government to register eunuchs as citizens ,  he said . 
it followed with another ruling november <num>4</num>  by protecting  [ eunuchs ]  right to inherit property . 
now the court is awaiting further hearings that could expand eunuchs rights . 
the cj gave us recognition . 
he treated us like human beings ,  she added . 
the government has not ordered enforcement of the ruling ,  shazia said . 
however ,  it led to a marked change in attitude among civil servants and the general public toward eunuchs ,  she said . 
unfortunately  [ eunuchs ]  were not treated as human beings at all ,  said syed liaqat binouri ,  an islamabad-based lawyer and human right activist . 
they are looked down upon because of their choices . 
binouri ,  chairman of the society for human rights and prisoners aid  ( sharp )  ,  a non-governmental organization  ( ngo )  ,  said discrimination against eunuchs begins with their own families . 
they are first thrown out by their families ,  and parents dont accept them as their children ,  he said . 
society at large takes its cue from hostile families ,  he said . 
the eunuchs way of life is centuries old ,  he said ,  and society needs to be educate about them . 
in earlier times ,  he said ,  eunuchs parents and other relatives had to accept their right to own and inherit property . 
now that the supreme court has raised the status of that community ,  according to binouri ,  the government has the responsibility to protect their rights . 
the media have a responsibility too ,  he said ,  to educate the population about the right of eunuchs . 
shazia ,  besides being a plaintiff in a court case ,  chairs the moorat foundation of pakistan -- an ngo working to improve the welfare of eunuchs in the rawalpindi-islamabad area . 
moorat is a common term for eunuchs . 
we are as human as men and women ,  but different ,  she said . 
she added that she was born a male but with a female soul . 
we are a different breed ,  and we pleaded to the court to give eunuchs a different gender category . 
historically ,  khwaja saras were men who had undergone castration in order to become servants to the mughal kings wives . 
discrimination against eunuchs and transvestites continues everywhere ,  shazia said . 
however ,  she added that the police had been more positive toward eunuchs since the supreme court ruled in their favour . 
she quit school in the eighth grade and ran away to karachi at age <num>12</num>  when her parents attitude became unbearable ,  she said . 
almost daily ,  men intimidate or harass her in public or at dance parties . 
economic problems and anxieties about terrorism have hurt her livelihood as a dancer ,  she said . 
because of fear of suicide attacks and bomb blasts ,  people don't organise dance parties like they used to "  ,  she said . 
the general economic downturn and increased competition from female dancers also have hurt eunuchs' business ,  she said . 
the government should first recover  " hundreds of thousands of rupees "  that  " corrupt individuals "  had taken from eunuchs ,  she said . 
however ,  she said the eunuchs would be ready to take on the tough job of debt collection on behalf of the government . 
how would they do it ? 
clapping her hands ,  she responded they would stay uninvited in the homes of debtors until they paid up . 
a soldier stands on the debris of a mosque in the nowshera cantonment . 
the mosque was destroyed by suspected taliban militants in june <num>2009</num>  .
attacks on mosques ,  religious scholars and shrines receive widespread condemnation in pakistan . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
once considered the most secure zone in peshawar ,  the cantonment has become a focus for terror attacks by the taliban ,  which is aware that the chief minister ,  governor and other high officials live around there . 
authorities have even closed a military mosque near halims home . 
it is unusual that a muslim is blocked from going to the mosque to pray ,  halim told central asia online after finishing his early afternoon prayers at home . 
some wary residents even go to distant mosques to pray in what they hope will be a safer environment . 
attacks on mosques in pakistan started after september <num>11</num>  , <num>2001</num>  .
the taliban have even targeted funerals of security officials and exhumed bodies in sufi shrines to sow terror and their hatred for other sects . 
the violence has scared away numerous worshippers and has led to guards conducting searches outside mosques . 
the new security was evident january <num>15</num>  when a private guard frisked a <num>10</num> -year-old boy entering the darwesh mosque in peshawars cantonment area . 
on december <num>24</num>  <num>2009</num>  , a suicide bomber blew himself up just <num>50</num>  metres from the same institution . 
authorities have recorded <num>19</num>  taliban-linked attacks on mosques and other islamic institutions in the country since december <num>2007</num>  , when militancy began spreading beyond waziristan . 
federal interior minister rehman malik blamed the lashkar-e-jhangvi  ( lej )  for the december <num>28</num>  suicide bombing of a shia ashoura celebration that claimed more than <num>40</num>  lives . 
anti-shia sentiment runs strong in the taliban and its sympathisers . 
what we see right now is political violence -- with roots in the afghan conflict ,  which has stretched into pakistan . 
the ttp is the main backer of the anti-government forces . 
he added :  those who attack mosques are essentially brainwashed pawns in the hands of those who make them believe that only they are real muslims . 
qibla ayaz ,  director of the institute of islamic and arabic studies at the university of peshawar ,  could recall only one case - before the taliban came along - of muslims targeting a mosque :  the prophet muhammad ,  peace be upon him ,  demolished masjid-e-darrar ,  but it was because the prophet ,  peace be upon him ,  was told through wahy  ( revelation )  that it was built by munafiqin  ( hypocrites )  for a specific ulterior motive . 
i do not know of any other example of demolishing mosques in the name of islam . 
the ttp justified bombing the parade line mosque by calling it similar to masjid-e-darrar . 
senior ttp commander waliur rehman mehsud told bbc radio afterward that his men intended to kill senior army officers who were worshipping that day . 
but ayaz disputed the ttps analogy ,  saying the parade line mosque was not another masjid-e-darrar . 
the ttp has also tried to eliminate religious foes ,  not just military personnel ,  when it targets mosques . 
a suicide bomber killed anti-taliban cleric sarfraz naeemi during friday prayers in lahore on june <num>12</num>  <num>2009</num>  .
naeemi had vocally opposed the taliban and supported the military operation to drive it from the swat valley . 
he had issued a fatwa  ( religious edict )  against suicide attacks ,  saying they violate the teachings of islam . 
on the same day ,  another suicide bomber killed six worshippers and wounded more than <num>90</num>  inside a mosque in the nowshera cantonment ,  <num>40</num>  kilometres east of peshawar . 
the explosion caused the dome to fall in . 
a clergyman said it is against islamic law to target mosques . 
targeting a mosque or killing people inside a place of worship violates shariah ,  said maulana syedul arifeen ,  who runs a madrassa opposite the university of peshawar . 
a dry portion of the simli dam ,  <num>25</num>  km from islamabad ,  is pictured january <num>26</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
the federal capital is facing a severe water shortage due to a drought . 
the water level in the simli dam is just <num>26</num>  feet  ( <num>7.87</num>  metres )  high from dead level ,  enough for only <num>40</num>  days ,  according to media reports .

agriculture accounts for more than <num>20</num>  percent of pakistans gross domestic product  ( gdp )  ,  and nearly <num>45</num>  percent of the population directly or indirectly depends on agriculture for its livelihood . 
in fy <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  only the agricultural sector registered positive growth . 
inadequate winter rain and snow can potentially damage winter crops . 
alarm bells had already been ringing since the countrys major water reservoirs have been nearing the dead level . 
the situation has prompted citizens to pray for rain . 
speaking to central asia online from islamabad ,  the director general of pakistans meteorology department ,  qamar zaman chaudhary ,  confirmed the existence of a severe agricultural drought in rain-fed areas that could lead to crop failure . 
this barani  ( rain-fed )  area is running dry ,  though it remains an important wheat-growing area ,  contributing <num>15</num>  percent of the commodity that is a main dietary staple . 
el nino is an atmospheric phenomenon in the pacific ocean that leads to heavy rains in south america ,  and droughts in southern africa ,  southeastern asia and india . 
it also brings unusual weather to parts of north america . 
winter rains are crucial for filling up the snow-fed tarbela ,  one of the two major reservoirs in the country . 
if there is insufficient rainfall ,  the countrys main irrigated plains will suffer severe drought and major food crises can ensue . 
according to the meteorology office only <num>0.994</num>  million acre feet  ( maf )  of water is available behind the tarbela dam ,  which has a <num>9.30</num>  maf capacity . 
at the mangla dam ,  only <num>0.4</num>  maf water is available ,  which has a <num>4.82</num>  maf capacity . 
water inflows in the rawal ,  khanpur and simly dams near islamabad and rawalpindi are also diminishing . 
this situation may lead to shortages of potable water in urban areas since rainfall is likely to remain below normal . 
in the absence of dams ,  we lose precious water downstream into the sea ,  chairman of agri forum pakistan ibrahim mughal told central asia online from lahore . 
due to a host of climatic factors in <num>2009</num>  as much as <num>70</num>  maf of water was lost into the sea . 
water from india has been curtailed in the chenab ,  jehlum and neelum rivers due to construction of hydroelectric projects on the indian side . 
pakistan is facing global climatic changes too . 
wheat production in some areas has dropped from <num>1,200</num> -<num>1,400</num>  kilogram  to <num>880</num> -<num>1,020</num>  kilogram  per hectare in the past five years ,  she noted . 
according to oxfam ,  in many areas ,  wheat and cotton crops were destroyed by flash floods that left the communities unable to till lands to prepare for the next crop . 
that means difficult times lie ahead . 
pictures ,  accounts of school attack elicit anger toward attackers ,  sympathy for victims
peshawar ,  pakistan -- a front-page picture of an old man pulling a girl out of the rubble of her school caught the attention of onlookers at a newspaper stall at the university of peshawar . 
this is barbaric ,  students were heard saying after seeing the images of brutality the girls experienced at the hands of militants . 
a february <num>3</num>  bombing that hit a military convoy destroyed the school . 
four schoolgirls ,  a paramilitary soldier ,  three american military personnel ,  and a passerby died in the lower dir attack . 
among the <num>126</num>  wounded were <num>95</num>  students of the government girls high school in koto . 
they were receiving treatment at a hospital in timergara ,  headquarters of the lower dir district . 
they suffered multiple but not life-threatening injuries ,  doctors said . 
some of the wounded girls are as young as six . 
a bank official stopped eating breakfast and looked at a newspaper picture of a girl injured in the attack . 
accounts of the bombing poured forth from parents ,  relatives and students . 
the military initially identified the weapon as a roadside bomb but later said it was a suicide attack and that <num>140</num>  kilogram  of explosives had caused the damages . 
we all fell unconscious . 
we did not know when and how  [ they ]  brought us to the hospital ,  she said in a shaking voice . 
we were having science class . 
when we came to school in the morning ,  all the girls were happy as the clear blue sky added to the scenic beauty of our village . 
most injured students complained of back and head pain when the heavy blocks used in the building fell on them after the blast . 
one such injured student was class <num>6</num>  second  sunni . 
i dont know when it will go away ,  she said of the pain . 
an aid worker at the scene told central asia online ,  there were cries all over the school building as many girls were trapped under the rubble . 
one girl was crying ,  pull me out ;  im about to suffocate . 
senior teacher saeeda begum said the list of dead and wounded would have been even longer had students not been taking classes in the open . 
i found all the girls in high spirits in the morning as they started reaching the school ,  and it was not even in our imagination that a barbaric man would blow up his explosive-laden vehicle so close to our school ,  she said . 
destroying the education infrastructure is one part of the talibans campaign to destroy the existing state system and replace it with its own . 
officials said militants have targeted more than <num>72</num>  schools in lower dir during the past two years . 
in swat ,  the taliban have destroyed more than <num>200</num>  girls schools ,  affecting some <num>70,000</num>  students ,  mostly girls . 
wednesdays bombing of the convoy also was aimed at destroying the school ,  security officials said . 
our initial report is that the bomber wanted to strike two targets - one is the convoy and the other is the school building . 
you know these militants are dead set against girls education ,  the officials said on condition of anonymity . 
rehman believes the attack has caused significant damage to girls education . 
you know ,  the female literacy rate in our region is very poor . 
an attack like this will force parents to keep girls away from education ,  he warned . 
he demanded a special relief package from the provincial government . 
the federal government last may ordered a military offensive against the militants ,  and thousands of soldiers moved into the swat ,  buner and lower dir districts . 
lower dir is the home district of maulana sufi muhammad ,  the cleric who launched a bloody campaign for the enforcement of shariah  ( islamic law )  in the <num>1990</num>  second  . 
authorities blame his son-in-law ,  mullah fazlullah ,  for the violence in the swat district between <num>2007</num>  and <num>2009</num>  .
police criticised for failing to stem karachi violence
karachi ,  pakistan - this city of <num>12</num>  meter  remains on tenterhooks as it mourns over <num>70</num>  of its citizens killed in the past week . 
critics of the local government are questioning whether police have the professional attitude and equipment needed to protect the city . 
plotters of the devastating twin bombings february <num>5</num>  appeared to out-think the police . 
with decembers attack on the ashura procession - which claimed over <num>40</num>  lives - still fresh in local memories ,  the entire police force concentrated on securing the main procession commemorating the chehlum of hazrat imam hussain  ( ra )  . 
this approach proved to be a deadly blunder ,  as suspected militants planted a roadside bomb elsewhere ,  blowing up a bus carrying pilgrims to the procession and killing <num>20</num>  .
speaking to news media ,  chief minister sindh syed qaim ali shah conceded the government was focused primarily on the chehlum procession and failed to anticipate an attack anywhere else . 
jameel yusuf ,  a security analyst and former chairman of the citizen police liaison committee ,  agrees . 
police ,  traffic police or the paramilitary rangers were not patrolling shahra-e-faisal ,  a highway connecting the city to the airport and used regularly by ,  among others ,  vips ,  where the attack took place ,  he said . 
he added that there was no snap checking of vehicles ,  even though various intelligence agencies had warned of the likelihood of suicide attacks in the city . 
but that omission would not be the only tragic failure that day . 
as paramedics transported the injured and the dead to nearby jinnah hospital ,  another bomb exploded outside the hospitals emergency ward ,  claiming ten more lives . 
the bomb ,  concealed on a motorbike in a nearby parking lot ,  escaped the scrutiny of the bomb disposal squad  ( bds )  and the sniffer dogs of the paramilitary rangers . 
police defused a third bomb of <num>20</num>  kilogram  of wired explosives in a computer inside the hospitals emergency ward because it was too heavy and found inside it . 
no safety measures had been adopted to ensure that the hospital was safe ,  as nobody thought that the hospital could be a target ,  said yusuf . 
contingency measures should have been adopted to ensure the hospital was a safe zone . 
according to sources in the police department ,  in early december ,  bds officials wrote to the sindh provinces ig special branch ,  requesting replacement of existing bds bomb detection equipment . 
the bds said most of its equipment was not in working order . 
the letter emphasised replacing the equipment in earnest ahead of the major muslim commemoration of ashura and festival of rabiul awal  [ birth anniversary of the holy prophet ]  ,  said one police source on condition of anonymity . 
he said bomb detection equipment ,  walk-through gates and metal detectors were all broken . 
the bds personnel undergo a week-long course in handling various scanners and detectors but are unable to manage and operate jammers ,  he said . 
local police also lack the technology for eavesdropping on cell phones and rely on data given by intelligence agencies and the ngo that yusuf once headed ,  the citizen police liaison committee . 
information is not always forthcoming from those outside bodies . 
yusuf asked why the police do not have trained men and equipment of their own . 
critics point to another perceived failing of the karachi police :  its inability to stem massacres or waves of targeted killings once they break out . 
last week was particularly grim for the citys residents ,  who saw nearly <num>45</num>  of their neighbours ,  most of them ethnic pashtuns ,  slain in such violence . 
yusuf denounced the quality of the polices work in karachi ,  calling it a politicised force that serves only its political masters rather than the city's population . 
islamabad ,  pakistan -quoting unnamed taliban sources ,  pakistani media on february <num>9</num>  again reported that tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  chief hakeemullah mehsud is dead . 
the ttp commander died recently ,  according to unnamed sources from the orakzai tribal agency ,  from injuries inflicted by a january <num>14</num>  missile attack . 
the ttp ,  while not offering any evidence of hakeemullahs continued existence ,  is still denying its leader died . 
pakistan geo television said ttp spokesman azam tariq has again rejected the medias death reports . 
pakistani government officials and the militarys press office have not issued a statement regarding the latest reports . 
local media first reported hakeemullahs death january <num>14</num>  , quoting local government officials after a missile attack on the shaktoi village of the sararogha administrative subdivision of the south waziristan tribal agency . 
reportedly ,  he had been staying at the house of a tribesman or attending a ttp meeting there . 
soon after the news broke ,  pakistani army spokesman major general athar abbas said the army was using its agents in the northwest tribal region ,  where the death reportedly occurred ,  to try to verify the reports . 
with the release of the second audiotape january <num>16</num>  , tariq announced the organisation would soon release a videotape of hakeemullah . 
to date ,  it has not . 
observers of the ttp in the tribal regions say the organisation is trying to keep its leaders death a secret as long as it can ,  until it selects a new commander . 
tariq confirmed that some taliban members had been killed but said hakeemullah was not present during the missile strike . 
later ,  in another statement ,  tariq said hakeemullah left the scene before the attack and did not deny the deaths of hakeemullahs uzbek bodyguards . 
tariq ,  however ,  did not comment on reports that the missile attack blew off the ttp commanders right leg . 
sources also reported that the ttp kidnapped a doctor from the hangu district of the north-west frontier province  ( nwfp )  and forced him to treat hakeemullah at the house of his father-in-law in mamozai ,  orakzai agency . 
the press is also reporting that the ttp has a new acting chief ,  molvi jamal toofaan ,  reportedly a close associate of al-qaeda . 
his duties reportedly include commanding the taliban in the orakzai agency . 
across the border in afghanistan too ,  the situation was in the talibans favour at the time . 
today ,  though ,  the ttp finds its border movements under relentless scrutiny and its afghan forces hounded by major government and coalition operations . 
in pakistan ,  too ,  the situation is grim . 
after the success of the ongoing military offensive in the south waziristan agency ,  the taliban has lost its stronghold there and is living on the run . 
in the north waziristan agency ,  the military and rival militant groups are also depriving it of sanctuaries ,  according to islamabad-based journalist and analyst qurysh khattak . 
continued air attacks by the pakistan military on suspected hideouts in north waziristan and in the orakzai and kurram tribal agencies are denying the taliban safe places to hide or regroup . 
moreover ,  after the suicide attack at the khost airbase ,  the frequency of missile attacks has increased substantially in the border region ,  khattak said .

international development loans to pakistan have increased <num>122</num>  %  in six months . 
 [ karim sahib / afp / getty images ] 
pakistan saw a <num>122</num>  %  increase in the disbursement of loans by international donors for development projects in the past six months of the <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  cycle . 
in fy10 ,  the donors ,  especially the world bank  [ wb ]  and the asian development bank  [ adb ]  ,  expedited the disbursement of loans to pakistan to augment development and economic activity and to help the government fight the recession ,  finance minister shaukat tarin told central asia online by phone from islamabad . 
the wb and adb have given a major chunk of loans ,  a little over us$1 billion ,  for health ,  education ,  irrigation ,  roads and energy sector projects ,  he said . 
enhanced lending ,  disbursement of credit by the international monetary fund  [ imf ]  ,  approval of us$7 . 5 billion in us aid ,  and promises of further japanese assistance have put the economy on a path to recovery and revived investor confidence ,  he said . 
foreign investors who deserted the pakistani stock market in <num>2008</num>  as the global crisis struck have returned to invest us <num>2008</num>  in the past six months ,  he said . 
in the same period a year ago ,  the stock market registered an outflow of us <num>2008</num>  . 
the return of many foreign investors to the stock market will encourage others to expand their footprint in pakistan ,  he said . 
the indicators have been generally positive in recent months ,  tarin said . 
the countrys exports grew <num>25</num>  percent in december <num>2009</num>  , compared to one year ago ,  because of global and domestic economic recovery ,  he said . 
furthermore ,  the government has trimmed the countrys account deficit from an imposing us$7 . 85 billion in july-december fy09 to us$1 . 75 billion one year later ,  he said . 
he also cited impressive growth in the foreign exchange sent home by pakistanis living overseas and in foreign exchange reserves . 
all these factors could improve chances for a modest recovery and economic growth this year ,  he added . 
they come after domestic and global economic crises savaged the market and dampened the investment climate . 
in <num>2008</num>  , pakistan contended with record trade and budget deficits . 
it had a combined trade and budget deficit of us$58 billion in fy07 and fy08 . 
in november <num>2008</num>  , the countrys foreign exchange reserves fell to about us$600m ,  barely enough to pay for two weeks of imports . 
thirteen months earlier ,  the reserves had hit a record us$16 . 4 billion . 
the breathtaking erosion of the countrys financial position caused a panic-driven capital outflow and a plunge in the value of the rupee . 
foreign donors stepped in to shore up the country as it tottered economically . 
in november <num>2008</num>  , the government secured a us$7 . 6 billion three-year bailout package from the imf . 
the world body boosted that to us$11 billion in <num>2009</num>  .
it also released us$3 . 1 billion that november to eliminate the threat of a default by pakistan . 
in <num>2009</num>  , the us announced us$7 . 5 billion in further assistance for pakistan over five years under the kerry-lugar bill . 
the friends of democratic pakistan  [ fodp ]  also promised to extend us$5 . 6 billion in support over three years ,  a guarantee that did much to restore confidence in the countrys prospects for recovery . 
but one former official says that the government needs to reform domestically ,  too ,  rather than merely seek increased foreign aid . 
the government should reduce the cost of doing business ,  secure release of funds pledged by the friends of democratic pakistan  [ fodp ]  and overcome the energy crisis to achieve  [ its ]  target of over <num>3</num>  %  economic growth in fy10 ,  dr salman shah ,  former finance minister ,  told central asia online from lahore . 
in his view ,  the prevailing tight monetary policy ,  very high interest rates of <num>15</num> -<num>25</num>  %  for corporate and individual borrowers ,  worsening shortages of electricity and gas ,  and a decline in tax revenues could impede economic growth . 
analysts say that if the country can combat terrorism and the energy crisis ,  economic growth can increase beyond <num>5</num>  %  annually . 
key afghan taliban commander reportedly arrested in pakistan
a pakistani man in karachi reads an urdu-language newspaper reporting the capture of a top taliban commander february <num>16</num>  .
pakistans interior minister rehman malik has denied the capture of mullah abdul ghani baradar in a joint pakistani-us operation . 
 [ rizwan tabassum / afp / getty images ] 
washington ,  dc - the afghan talibans top military commander and governor of herat province during the taliban regime has been arrested in karachi ,  news media reported february <num>16</num>  .
if confirmed ,  the arrest of mullah abdul ghani beradar will be a very big loss to the taliban tehreek ,  said rahimullah yusufzai ,  an expert on afghan issues and a senior pakistani journalist based in peshawar . 
he was a founding member of the taliban tehreek in <num>1994</num>  and was among the <num>22</num>  members present when mullah omar announced the founding of the taliban tehreek in kandahar ,  yusufzai said . 
yusufzai said that beradar is not a political figure but a military commander . 
he commanded the taliban army and served as governor of herat . 
the taliban and pakistani authorities are in rare agreement in denying the arrest took place . 
however ,  media stories have cited un-named pakistani military and government officials as confirming the arrest ,  which some accounts say took place seven to nine days ago . 
if the new york times gives information ,  it is not divine truth . 
it can be wrong . 
we have joint intelligence sharing . 
we do not have joint investigations or joint raids . 
but analysts and journalists in pakistan say that the arrest of beradar is all but certain to be fact . 
the news of the arrest of the top operational commander of the taliban tehreek ,  mullah beradar ,  carries much weight ,  riaz said . 
sources in pakistan have confirmed the news . 
he said afghan taliban and other foreign fighters are known to be in pakistan . 
hiding in karachi for the afghan taliban is much easier than in peshawar and quetta ,  he told central asia online by telephone . 
in karachi the pukhtoons dont know other well ,  because they have migrated from somewhere else . 
they dont know each others roots the way they do in peshawar and quetta . 
that lack of familiarity makes it easier for the afghans to hide ,  he said . 
yusufzai said the arrest in pakistan certainly confirms that the taliban leaders are hiding in pakistan ,  not only in quetta but in karachi and elsewhere also . 
before beradar ,  a significant number of taliban commanders were arrested in …pakistan ,  such as khairullah khairkhwa and lutfullah ,  in addition to mullah ubaidullah ,  whose arrest  [ authorities later denied had occurred ]  .

swat hoteliers offer free stays in effort to revive tourism
the tourism industry ,  the swat valleys third largest income earner ,  suffered under the mullah fazullah-led militancy . 
it is trying to recover after the successful military operation in swat last year . 
 [ arshad yusufzai ] 
swat ,  pakistan - empty hotel rooms and deserted attractions have leaders of the swat valley tourism industry trying to rebuild their businesses . 
the project could take years . 
rich in forested mountains and pleasantly cool in the summer ,  the valley was known in peaceful times as the switzerland of pakistan . 
it drew countless tourists and made the tourism industry the third most important in the valley . 
an estimated half-million locals work directly or indirectly in the sector . 
about <num>15,000</num>  employees work in the <num>885</num>  hotels and restaurants ,  said zahid khan ,  president of the all swat hotels association . 
many more valley residents depend on tourists and their rupees . 
skilled artisans and shopkeepers lost their livelihoods as violence enveloped the region and as tourism cratered ,  starting in <num>2007</num>  .
now ,  in the wake of the <num>2009</num>  military offensive that drove out the mullah fazullah-led taliban ,  the hoteliers have a second chance . 
the swat hotels association ,  in conjunction with the upper swat hotels association and the kalam hotels association ,  is offering free ten-day stays at the height of the winter snowfall . 
the associations wanted to fill empty rooms in the off-season and to encourage tourists to see the now-peaceful valley . 
the scheme worked . 
about <num>800</num>  tourists from all over pakistan responded to our offer ,  khan said . 
the hotels would have done even better if the government had helped ,  he said . 
the  [ provincial governments sarhad tourism corporation ]  did nothing to promote our offer ,  he said . 
the government also needs to work at attracting foreigners ,  he said . 
other hotel leaders expressed a desire to bring back tourists . 
roadside checkpoints are problematic ,  as tourists resent bodily searches for concealed explosives and weapons . 
about a dozen checkpoints still exist on major roads ,  such as the mingora-kalam route . 
hotel owners suggest issuing tourists a special pass at the first checkpoint so that they can present the document to each successive set of guards . 
those willing to put up with the checkpoints generally have three attractions in mind :  kalam ,  miandam and the malam jabba ski resort . 
nobody can visit malam jabba now as militants damaged its facilities and the government still considers the area unsafe . 
 " we had about <num>30</num>  families visiting kalam "  ,  said kalam hotels association general secretary syed nawab . 
 " we were encouraged by the response "  . 
he urged the government to provide interest-free loans to hotel owners seeking to reconstruct their war-damaged businesses . 
miandam ,  a quiet town nestled in forested hills ,  also saw some tourists who were unlikely to come otherwise . 
hotel owners put the number at about <num>20</num>  families . 
eight families from lahore and karachi stayed in the tourism corporation's motel ,  manager akbar ali said . 
five families from the punjab stayed at the junaid hotel ,  said general manager raza khan . 
 " they <abbr>…</abbr>  promised to come again in the summer "  ,  said khan ,  who survived two assassination attempts by suspected militants . 
the hotel owners liked the results of the free-stay offer so much that they are planning to offer another such promotion in march . 
they hope that more tourists will come and realise the valley is peaceful again . 
kite festival still grounded

despite public safety appeals hundreds were arrested last weekend for violating the ban .

lahore ,  pakistan - kite lovers in some punjab cities defied a ban this weekend on their hobby ,  but lahore is still waiting - and hoping - for permission to fly . 
punjab officials ,  citing safety concerns ,  refused to lift a ban on basant last week ,  a centuries-old spring kite festival . 
despite the prohibition ,  in place for several years ,  residents of several cities proceeded to celebrate basant and were arrested . 
police arrested some <num>1,000</num>  people in gujranwala ,  sheikhupora ,  faisalabad ,  kasur and rawalpindi for possession of ,  or for actually flying ,  kites in defiance of the government ban . 
in one raid feburary <num>19</num>  , ganjmandi police arrested two people and seized <num>1,430</num>  kites and <num>300</num>  chemical-coated strings ,  according to the daily times . 
among those arrested over the weekend were sheikh saleem ,  secretary general of the district kite flying association lahore . 
he was arrested and then released for announcing his group had received new dates for the festival after a petition to fly kites february <num>20</num> -<num>21</num>  was rejected . 
we have given fresh dates <abbr>…</abbr>  of march <num>6</num>  and <num>7</num>  to celebrate basant ,  saleem told central asia online . 
we requested that chief minister punjab shahbaz sharif please not let this event go to waste . 
senior journalist khawar naeem hashmi told central asia online that inhabitants of the subcontinent traditionally start spring with basant . 
in order to resemble flowers ,  people wear yellow clothes ,  he said . 
they sing and fly kites to celebrate spring . 
all this is called basant . 
but according to him ,  tragedy caused by overzealous competitors has marred the festivities . 
during the past five years ,  basant turned bloody when contestants started using razor-studded strings and gunfire to bring down others kites ,  hashmi said . 
a number of people have died when they were cut by the treated kite strings or were struck by stray bullets . 
the traditional festival has turned into a bone of contention between kite lovers and the punjab government . 
pakistan peoples party-affiliated provincial governor salman taseer favours kite flying ,  but the sharif-led pakistan muslim league-affiliated government is not ready to allow basant celebrations . 
taseer has accused the sharif government of turning lahore into a graveyard by banning kites . 
what does it want to accomplish by banning basant ,  closing food street and demolishing buildings in lahore ,  he asked at a news conference . 
i will celebrate basant all of my life ,  as lahore is the city of the lively and basant is the identity of the city . 
mian yousaf salah uddin ,  a local cultural figure ,  also favours basant and said ,  if the government cant give food ,  shelter or clothes to the masses ,  at least it shouldn't deprive them of the rare celebrations in their lives "  ,  he said . 
but the punjabi government is standing firm . 
 " we will take strict action against those who violate the ban on kite flying "  ,  said district co-ordination officer sajjad bhutta . 
last weekend it did . 
the question now is whether sheikh saleem and the kite-flying group can sway the government before march <num>6</num> -<num>7</num>  .
local government programmes get support

pakistani political activists are meeting with officials from the new government to help ensure the continuation of local government programmes . 
it has helped reconvene relationships between the people and state ,  said daniyal aziz ,  former chairman of pakistans national reconstruction bureau . 
millions of dollars have been committed by international donors in order to continue dtce programmes under pakistans new government . 
the swiss agency for development and cooperation  ( sdc )  along with other donors have recently grouped in support of devolution programmes and plan to meet with government officials asking that it remain a priority . 
we are therefore beginning a dialogue with the new government about its plans for decentralisation ,  said dfid programme associate ,  tim hatton . 
the local body movement over the past <num>10</num>  years has been the best thing that happened in pakistan . 
the donors have doled out millions of dollars to support the move towards decentralisation ,  said saeed . 
nationwide ,  dtce has allowed everyday people to get involved in government funded initiatives . 
typically ,  only the wealthy in pakistan could afford to run political campaigns ,  but in local body elections ,  even school teachers can run . 
she said ,  there has not been a comprehensive study to document the impact of devolution and dtce . 
the only assessments that have been done focused on specific sectors and geographic areas . 
she continued ,  dtce has been a demonstrable model for encouraging citizen engagement . 
an official from the swiss development cooperation ,  another major donor to dtce ,  said ,   " we don't know if strengthening district councils and local governments will be a priority of the new government . 
changes could be made in shifting more power to provincial leaders rather than district leaders .  " 
dtce programmes have covered <num>35</num>  percent of the country where there was little to no community involvement in local policy making and activism . 
hundreds of elections have been held creating local community council boards  ( ccb )  throughout pakistan . 
the boards assess finance requirements for projects in education ,  community awareness and gender issues . 
legal aid committees have also been established through dtce to provide pro-bono legal assistance to ccb members and citizens . 
a local citizen information network television programme recorded in <num>11</num>  districts provides a forum for dialogue on the effectiveness of the local government in education ,  health services and police-community relations . 
supporters of dtce hope the programme continues to spread throughout the country . 
a woman inhales drugs in lahore . 
drug addiction has increased steadily among girls and women in pakistan . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore ,  pakistan - drug abuse is nothing new ,  but pakistan is facing a two-pronged problem . 
second ,  more women are using and the country refuses to take seriously the social factors that contribute to this worsening picture . 
drug addiction can start in school . 
girls at one private institution used hashish in the restroom while a reporter was there . 
a headmistress of one girls college in lahore expelled a group of her students for possessing and using narcotics on the premises . 
the problem of drug addiction among women cannot be separated from other aspects of their social conditioning … such as racism ,  sexism and poverty … that are essential to understanding drug abuse in women ,  said tasneem nazir ,  a clinical psychologist at lahores mayo hospital .  s
he said teenage girls are likely to abuse substances in order to lose weight ,  relieve stress or boredom ,  improve their mood ,  reduce sexual inhibitions ,  self-medicate depression and increase confidence . 
women who seek treatment for alcohol and drug problems report a connection among domestic violence ,  childhood abuse ,  and substance abuse . 
one woman said she had suffered from physical ,  mental and financial abuse before turning to drugs . 
nazir said that to declare addiction openly is to sign a social death warrant . 
the youth of today are a pathetic sight ,  he said . 
greater attention is being paid to create awareness among the people about the dangers of drug abuse and the ways to avoid it . 
bakshi said women ,  especially young girls belonging to elite backgrounds ,  are becoming addicts . 
some women are not aware of the drugs they are taking . 
doctors prescribe a medicine ,  and some incurious users know little about the side effects . 
many women have been taking such medicines for months or years and have become dependent on them . 
we came to the doctor for treatment . 
i didnt know the medicines used prescribed by the doctor are poison . 
bakshi said the anf has established wards at eight government hospitals to provide free treatment . 
but most patients dont know where they can get help ,  either before or after the addiction takes hold . 
it is important for women to have the knowledge and skills to be a positive force in confronting this problem ,  especially in drug prevention ,  bakshi said . 
it is an imperative of this time that all sections of society combine their efforts to eradicate drugs from our society . 
he suggested that for complete eradication ,  systematic education and constant community support need to exist . 
it is essential to … implement awareness programmes effectively and intelligently ,  he said . 
doing so would lead to a better and  ( more )  prosperous future for each member of the society . 
the barriers to treatment for women must be addressed because most programmes are based on male-oriented models that are not geared to the needs of women ,  mahmooda said . 
the need of the time is programmes must be designed to overcome the current barriers to womens access to and participation in treatment . 
road linking parachinar to peshawar fraught with danger
the pak hotels management set up bedding for stranded turi tribe members in an imambargah  ( shia place of worship )  in the hotel . 
a suicide bombing of their convoy killed <num>12</num>  and injured <num>30</num>  on march <num>5</num>  .
 [ intikhab amir ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan - jawad hussein ,  <num>41</num>  , is hostage to a situation beyond his control . 
sitting cross-legged and with fists clenched under his arms ,  he intermittently looks at the ceiling of a sprawling hall . 
other men sitting on the floor nod sympathetically as he narrates his story . 
im in big trouble ,  jawad says . 
he came from abu dhabi february <num>26</num>  to visit his spouse and five children . 
the planned reunion ,  he adds ,  came after more than two years of work for a german company . 
it gave him a one-month leave . 
now ,  he fears he might not see his family as travel to his native parachinar ,  headquarters of kurram agency ,  is blocked because the road linking peshawar to parachinar is closed . 
i have developed a hatred for this country ,  says jawad . 
staying in the pak hotel ,  he is rapidly running out of money . 
the hotel ,  according to receptionist tayyab hussain ,  is housing <num>300</num>  to <num>400</num>  guests - all stranded . 
they are waiting for the government to arrange safe passage to parachinar . 
sectarian violence has made the <num>50</num>  kilometer  segment of the peshawar-parachinar highway unsafe . 
when the stranded people finally got a ride out march <num>5</num>  , it was deadly . 
the convoy was attacked ,  and <num>12</num>  were killed . 
another <num>30</num>  were injured . 
it is not known whether jawad or other people interviewed for this article a few days earlier were among the dead . 
kamal hussain ,  another stranded traveller ,  said the road has been closed since november <num>2007</num>  , when sectarian riots broke in the upper and lower kurram regions . 
taliban were fanning sectarian violence in the agency ,  and after dividing the tribes on  ( a sectarian basis )  ,  they were ruling the area ,  says a press release from one of the security agencies that recently cracked down on the taliban . 
thousands of sunni families migrated to safer places from the shia-majority areas of parachinar ,  bagzai ,  baleeshkhel ,  bilyamin ,  and inziri . 
after that attack ,  the convoy to returned to peshawar . 
ali askar ,  who owns a passenger coach ,  said that three men travelling in a car were killed by gunfire coming from the toot-kach village . 
the february <num>24</num>  shooting reminds pakistanis of similar incidents last year in afghanistan . 
we received the bullet-riddled body and his luggage ,  said shabab . 
the turi tribe has had a hard time trying to reach peshawar thanks to the road closure . 
but for jawad ,  afghanistans land route is not an option . 
i planned this trip after knowing about the convoys under government protection . 
the denial of road access to turis ,  said kamal ,  amounts to an economic blockade against parachinar . 
the city ,  he added ,  is forced to receive food and grain supplies from afghanistan . 
even supplies from peshawar come on afghan roads . 
prices are skyrocketing as a result ,  he said . 
it was us <num>27</num>  $   ( rs <num>2,314</num>  )  in november <num>2007</num>  .
two years ago ,  he said ,  the rate from parachinar to peshawar was about us <num>2</num>  $   ( rs <num>168</num>  )  . 
sunnis fleeing from parachinar suffered enormous financial losses . 
they lost property and businesses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars . 
turis occupied our homes and looted our shops after we left parachinar for safety ,  said haji sawab gul ,  who is spearheading the campaign for the safe return of more than <num>500</num>  displaced sunni families . 
carpets worth millions of rupees have been looted from our <num>80</num>  shops in usmania plaza ,  parachinar city ,  said gul . 
turis ,  too ,  suffered economically . 
mumtaz hussein ,  <num>50</num>  , lost his family business . 
a mortar shell landed on the roof of his shop at toori market ,  parachinar ,  reducing everything to ashes . 
after he reopened the shop ,  the taliban looted his flour supplies ,  worth us <num>20,000</num>  $   ( rs <num>1.7</num>  meter  )  ,  at bagzai village ,  he said . 
parachinars health care has also withered . 
turis living there have to rely on an erratic supply of medicine from afghanistan . 
those who cannot abide watching their loved ones go untreated risk their lives to reach medical care in peshawar . 
mir hussein brought his <num>12</num> -year-old son to peshawar to have a broken arm set . 
its history includes a massive car bombing on december <num>6</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , that killed <num>35</num>  .
jawad is worried about his safety . 
he frequently talks to his family by phone to keep them abreast of his situation . 
he had no choice but to wait for the march <num>5</num>  convoy . 
he couldnt afford the daily charter flights between peshawar and parachinar . 
my family is really nervous ,  he said . 
it seems they had cause to worry . 
pakistani sports suffer during militancy

peshawar ,  pakistan -- shazia malik spends three to five hours every day training to achieve her goal :  a gold medal in cycling at the 31st national games in peshawar ,  scheduled for march <num>25</num> -<num>31</num>  .
organisers postponed the games last november after threats to players and officials . 
some <num>5,000</num>  male and female athletes will participate while <num>2,000</num>  technical officials will supervise <num>27</num>  events at <num>18</num>  different venues in peshawar ,  islamabad ,  abbottabad and mardan . 
besides four provincial and different departmental teams ,  federally administered tribal areas and islamabad teams will also feature at the countrys biggest sporting gala . 
malik ,  <num>27</num>  , is living with death threats from suspected islamic militants . 
but she has not stopped training for the gold she is eyeing . 
life and death are in the hands of god . 
that is what my belief is . 
i am exercising every day in the hope i will win gold ,  she told central asia online . 
living in a suburb of peshawar where militants from the darra adamkhel semi-autonomous southern region have penetrated as they close in on the city ,  she disguises herself ,  gives out a fictitious home address and takes other precautions . 
stop exercising ,  anonymous callers warned her by phone . 
but malik is undeterred . 
she proved her mettle during the last inter-provincial games held in peshawar in november <num>2008</num>  , when she clinched two gold medals . 
after her splendid performance in that contest ,  she received a job offer from the water and power development authority and will represent it at the national games . 
players representing departmental teams tend to win more medals than those representing provinces because of better training facilities . 
the talibans ongoing attacks have impacted sports as much the education and business sectors . 
this danger had made pakistan a no-go country for foreign athletes . 
as a result ,  the pakistani cricket team now plays home matches in neutral venues such as the united arab emirates . 
militancy has affected cricket ,  which is very much followed in this country ,  more than any other game ,  shakeel khan ,  spokesman for the pakistan cricket board ,  told central asia online . 
he added that the board has lost millions of rupees in revenue because it had to give up its home games . 
extremists see the presence of foreign teams in pakistan as an opportunity to attack them . 
in <num>2002</num>  , the new zealand cricket team escaped a suicide attack targeting french naval engineers in karachi . 
on march <num>3</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , militants attacked the sri lankan cricket team in lahore with rocket launchers ,  automatic assault rifles and hand grenades . 
still ,  the attack killed six policemen and another driver and injured eight of the players . 
even pakistani cricket teams are unwilling to play in peshawar because of its rampant militancy . 
instead the peshawar team has to travel more than <num>1,600</num>  kilometer  to play matches in the southern port city of karachi . 
for the past two years ,  no team from any other city has been willing to come to play scheduled national tournament matches in peshawar ,  asghar khan ,  secretary of the peshawar district cricket association ,  told central asia online . 
arbab niaz cricket stadium has not hosted an international match since <num>2006</num>  .
islamic militants killed several players at a volleyball match in southern lakki marwat district near south and north waziristan january <num>1</num>  when a suicide bomber exploded his vehicle ,  killing more than <num>100</num>  people . 
it was a big tragedy resulting in the killing of several volleyball players ,  shahid kamal ,  secretary of the nwfp volleyball association ,  said as he coached players at the peshawar sports complex ,  venue of the 31st national games . 
frustration creeps into the youth when they do not play any sports ,  and thats what the militants want :  that youth become frustrated and join the taliban . 
moments before the colourful closing ceremony of the inter-provincial games in peshawar in november <num>2008</num>  , a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the main gate of the qayyum sports complex ,  killing several . 
no players or organisers were among the killed . 
we know the government is fully aware of the security threats and that it is making every effort to provide foolproof security for the national games ,  zulfiqar ali butt ,  the games organising secretary ,  said to central asia online . 
senior police official muhammad karim khan acknowledged direct threats to the national games but vowed to make the event a success . 
we have a security plan and will depute as many cops as they need "  ,  he said .

while women turned out sunday to demonstrate for their rights in a country that lacks laws on domestic abuse ,  lawmakers are debating whether polygamy should be allowed . 
 [ arif ali / afp / getty images ] 
pakistani laws allow a man to contract a second marriage only after obtaining the express consent of his first wife . 
pakistani and islamic laws exist to discourage this practice by imposing stringent restrictions on polygamy ;  however ,  the culture of contracting more than one marriage is still prevalent ,  particularly in rural societies . 
it came as a surprise for women in pakistan when a female legislator in the punjab assembly ,  samina khawar hayat ,  forcefully pleaded the case for amending the existing laws that bar men from contracting second marriage without the consent of first wife . 
we need to amend laws and allow men to marry a second ,  third ,  even a fourth time without seeking permission from the first wife ,  samina ,  of the pakistan muslim league ,  told lawmakers in the punjab assembly . 
the issue of polygamy came up for discussion in the last week of february during a debate on a motion regarding recruitment of unmarried women in government departments . 
i stand by my words ,  samina told central asia online by phone from lahore . 
i will not talk on this issue anymore ,  she said before disconnecting the phone . 
polygamy also provided some entertainment for lawmakers in the national parliament . 
talking in parliament hallways to journalists ,  gabool said he was joking . 
however ,  he also said he strongly believes most parliamentarians have contracted either secret or publicly accepted marriages . 
this august house shall seek the resignation of punjab assembly  ( provincial )  member samina khawar hayat for advocating polygamy in contravention of the law ,  rehman said from the floor of the assembly . 
polygamy was no joking matter for the visibly agitated conservatives ,  particularly the clerics sitting on the floor . 
condemning what gabool said in the national assembly and what samina said in the punjab assembly ,  national assembly member bushra gohar said the parliamentarians have turned a very serious issue into farce . 
bushra said polygamy is an issue of life and death for women and children . 
bushra ,  who was a womens rights activist before entering politics and joining the nationalist awami national party ,  said that samina might be fed up with her own husband when she publicly asked him to marry more than two wives . 
bushra said both ordinary and islamic laws do not allow men to marry a second wife ,  adding that islam is often misinterpreted . 
permission from the first wife carries no weight in pakistani society . 
a housewife ,  najma jehan ,  said no sane woman would support repealing of laws barring men from contracting a second marriage without the consent of the first wife . 
afghan president hamid karzai is scheduled to visit pakistan march <num>10</num>  .
analysts say he has a sizable agenda ,  including handover of key taliban commanders recently captured in pakistan . 
no doubt this is a crucial visit by the afghan president to pakistan ,  after he announced his plan for reaching out to the taliban at the london conference ,  said hummayun khan ,  former pakistani secretary of foreign affairs . 
he is coming to islamabad with a big agenda . 
aimal khattak ,  a senior journalist and expert on afghan issues ,  said karzai would be less aggressive than in earlier dealings with pakistan . 
unlike in the past ,  karzai will be more attentive to pakistan ,  as islamabad has a long list of complaints this time ,  khattak said . 
in the past ,  afghanistan has pushed pakistan to dismantle taliban training centres and hideouts in its tribal belt . 
recent military operations <abbr>…</abbr>  in <abbr>…</abbr>  south waziristan and bajaur successfully destroyed hideouts and training facilities ,  khattak said . 
analysts predict an emboldened pakistan to be frank with karzai ,  now that it has brought tribal territories under government control . 
pakistani leaders will likely focus on their concerns about afghan taliban entering pakistan as they flee the coalition offensive in southern afghanistan . 
after the marjah operation in afghanistans helmand province ,  coalition forces are planning to push further into kandahar - a taliban stronghold and seat of taliban supreme leader mullah muhammad omar . 
pakistani forces have some of mullah omars associates in custody . 
they recently arrested about seven senior taliban leaders and trusted colleagues of mullah omar . 
most were nabbed in karachi . 
according to khattak ,  karzai will be definitely asking for the handing over of the arrested taliban commanders ,  particularly mullah abdul ghani baradar ,  mullah kabir ,  mullah salam and amir muhammad . 
pakistan has expressed its desire to transfer the prisoners to their country of origin and talks are reportedly ongoing between pakistan and afghanistan ,  since there is no extradition treaty . 
hummayun also predicted that karzai will seek islamabads co-operation in reaching out to moderate taliban leaders who are willing to talk peace . 
the recent arrests of mullah omars senior colleagues <abbr>…</abbr>  showed that pakistan believed mullah omar is not the best pick in the new situation . 
mullah omar and his inner circle bristled when karzai ,  at the london conference ,  expressed hopes of reconciling with the taliban and called on pakistan to help
afghanistan realise that goal . 
pakistan might also seek discussions about its neighbour and rival ,  india ,  and its role in afghanistan . 
but hummayun said ,  karzai wont even listen to it ,  as he doesnt want to stop india in afghanistan for the benefit of pakistan . 
officials hope arrests of taliban leaders deflate insurgency
kabul ,  afghanistan - police have arrested seven ranking afghan taliban officials in pakistan of late . 
the arrests have been called a coup against the afghan taliban in pakistan ,  but the implications go beyond the arrests . 
analysts have been trying to answer two questions :  has the capture of the seven key players weakened the insurgency ,  and what motivated pakistan to make the arrests ? 
afrasiab khattak ,  provincial leader of the awami national party ,  says all of the captured taliban leaders were important commanders and facilitators and that their arrests will definitely weaken the movement . 
saifullah ahmadzai ,  an afghan analyst who works with the kabul-based centre for conflict and peace studies ,  and several pakistani journalists agree that the arrest will hurt the insurgency . 
finding new leadership for the taliban is not a problem for them ,  as the man who works under the commander is upgraded to the commander level when the need arises ,  saad said . 
the real issue is <abbr>…</abbr>  the commander <abbr>…</abbr>  knows the people who supply arms ,  ammunition ,  <abbr>etc.</abbr> 
when the main leader or leaders are arrested or killed ,  it becomes very difficult for the new leader to familiarise himself with the new situation . 
at face value ,  by making these arrests ,  pakistan is losing a few friends in afghanistan ,  saad said . 
the links between the afghan taliban and pakistans intelligence agencies are no secret . 
but i think with these arrests pakistan sent a strong message to the taliban leadership ,  particularly those who were negotiating with <abbr>…</abbr>   ( afghan president hamid karzai )  . 
mullah baradar and tayab agha were for negotiations ,  he said . 
the message was that they cant move ahead with such initiatives on their own without taking pakistan into their confidence . 
it was a message <abbr>…</abbr>  that a durable peace in afghanistan isnt possible without a role for pakistan . 
some experts debate whether pakistan is really committed to act against the afghan taliban or whether the arrests were a ploy to disrupt the reconciliation process that karzai broached in january at the london conference . 
khattak said the coup does not necessarily mean that the pakistani government is serious about crushing the afghan taliban . 
excessive international pressure bludgeoned pakistan to show some commitment ,  he told central asia online . 
ahmadzai agrees that international pressure occurred ,  but he also sees a conspiracy at work . 
he told central asia online ,  pakistan will never want to see a stable and united afghanistan . 
the afghan government developed a reconciliation plan in the london conference and then announced a peace jirga that is going to be held in april . 
the afghan taliban had demonstrated a willingness to come to talks ;  they even had participated in some meetings . 
as soon as the meetings were known ,  pakistan arrested the leaders to block any peace and reconciliation efforts in afghanistan . 
even senior pakistani journalist shamim shahid and afghan political analyst waheedullah ghazikhel said pakistan made the arrests simply to harm the reconciliation process . 
but riffatullah orakzai ,  who has been reporting from the terrorism-afflicted north west frontier province and the tribal areas for bbc urdu ,  and rokhan yousafzai ,  working for daily express in peshawar ,  disagrees with that interpretation . 
orakzai told central asia online that pakistan has now realised the need to eliminate terrorism and has changed its policies accordingly . 
i think pakistan is now serious against terrorism ,  and the top arrests prove this . 
if pakistan was not serious ,  it would not have hit them at such a top level ,  orakzai said . 
it remains unclear whether pakistan will hand over the captured taliban leaders to afghanistan ,  though karzai recently visited pakistan to discuss joint anti-terror strategies and bilateral co-operation . 
while pakistans supreme court has ordered officials not to deliver the prisoners to any outside country ,  many of the analysts predict that the arrested leaders will eventually end up in afghan prisons and under investigation by intelligence agencies .

marjah ,  afghanistan - new roads ,  new schools ,  new crops are in the plans for helmand province . 
with taliban militants driven from marjah and other villages by operation moshtarak ,  the government of afghanistan and the international community are launching reconstruction projects . 
civilians and troops still have to watch their footing ;  fleeing insurgents planted improvised explosive devices throughout marjah ,  dawood ahmadi ,  spokesman for helmand provincial governor gulab mangal ,  told central asia online . 
but the government is nevertheless working on revitalization ,  he said . 
a <num>35</num>  kilometer  road linking marjah with lashkargah ,  the provincial centre ,  will be blacktopped soon ,  he said . 
new schools and health clinics are being constructed across the district . 
farmers are provided free seeds and training so they can grow profitable crops besides poppy . 
a master reconstruction plan envisions a complete rebuilding of the entire insurgency-hit district ,  local officials said . 
under the plan ,  workers will rebuild houses damaged in the fighting and locals will enjoy job and educational opportunities they previously lacked . 
afghan president hamid karzai ,  british prime minister gordon brown ,  second vice president karim khalili ,  nato commanders and many afghan ministers have visited the province recently to meet the people and develop reconstruction plans according to the local demands ,  the official said . 
a number of afghan ministries are working in the province . 
other key projects are the renovation and construction of government offices ,  schools ,  and clinics ;  the clearing of canals ;  and the creation of jobs . 
the afghan government is taking the lead in determining development needs ,  with much of the funding coming from foreign governments and multilateral organizations such as the world bank . 
a provincial official told central asia online on the condition of anonymity that the operation is likely . 
however ,  he said it would not be a marjah-like offensive . 
so the focus of the operation is to wipe out the insurgents hiding in the remote areas and to deploy forces there permanently to carry out reconstruction .

the committees ,  he said ,  not only will reduce the crime rate but also will help immediately apprehend terrorists and criminals . 
the committees have been assigned the task of collecting and verifying particulars of tenants in the locality and submitting them to the local police station ,  he said . 
the local members of the provincial assemblies  ( mpas )  will brief prayer leaders about counterterrorism measures ,  and the prayer leaders will create awareness among the masses in this regard . 
to check militancy ,  we do need greater citizen involvement at various levels ,  bosal said . 
this can come about only if  ( the government )  creates a sense of teamwork and a unified front against a common cause and if it closes the current distance  ( between the government and the public )  . 
the mpcs have gained the responsibility of monitoring their areas for suspicious activities and will be held accountable ,  he said . 
to boost their prestige and effectiveness ,  they must be consulted by the police in matters of arrest and detention . 
its members act as eyes and ears and pass on relevant information pertaining to communal ,  social ,  and law-and-order related issues to the local police officer ,  safdar said . 
mpcs are important ,  too ,  for curbing sectarianism ,  especially during the holy month of muharram ,  he said . 
theyre formed at the local level and consist of a cross-section of society . 
the mpcs meet regularly to discuss and solve issues with the involvement of police ,  safdar said . 
tariq saleem dogar ,  the inspector general of police punjab ,  also has urged the district police officers to take strict measures to prevent the entry of terrorist elements into punjab . 
part of this is achieved by working with the mpcs and joint task teams . 
it is the responsibility of every member to point out the anti-social elements so that peace and tranquillity can be maintained ,  dogar said . 
the police have distributed information about the behavioural pattern of would-be suicide bombers to district police officers ,  security guards ,  watchmen ,  students and organisations . 
a counterstrategy is required to fight terrorism in these situations ,  dogar said . 
the strategy will be successful with public help . 
solid measures have been taken to effectively counter terrorism by equipping the police force with modern training ,  technology and weapons ,  said dogar . 
the war against terrorism can be won only with the help of every citizen . 
according to him ,  antiterrorist operations formerly confined to different parts of the city now reach into the countryside . 
police in rural areas now conduct searches ,  inspect vehicles ,  and patrol on horseback . 
reports of rising extremism in punjab have unnerved many residents of lahore . 
one basis for concern is the mushrooming growth of extremist madrassas in southern punjab ,  especially in taunsa tehsil . 
the schools admit numerous impoverished pakistanis seeking a religious education . 
the punjab police and border military force have established seven new checkpoints on the border of punjab and the nwfp  ( north west frontier province )   <abbr>…</abbr>  to block the possible entry of terrorists into punjab ,  said punjab law minister rana sanaullah . 
climate change fuels sea encroachment on indus delta

climate change and development have drastically reduced the mangroves ,  leading to sea encroachment . 
 [ ameer hamza ] 
karachi ,  pakistan -- the salty water keeps coming ,  and sindh province is paying the price . 
tahir qureshi ,  senior advisor to the international union for conversation of nature  ( iucn ) s pakistan coastal ecosystem ,  said that during a <num>2003</num>  survey he found sea water to have encroached onto the main river course . 
just seven years ago ,  the sea had transgressed up to <num>54</num>  kilometer  ,  he said . 
now ,  in <num>2010</num>  , it … is at the <num>57</num>  kilometer  mark . 
the indus river delta is the fifth largest in the world . 
the sea is causing a silent ecological disaster <abbr>…</abbr>  that has taken a toll of the badin and thatta districts ,  he told central asia online . 
among the casualties are the once lush green farms of banana ,  papaya ,  coconut and sugarcane . 
agriculture ,  fishing and livestock were the three main sources of livelihood in the region until <num>1960</num>  .
sindh farmers used to pride themselves on their export-quality red rice . 
climate change is blamed for raising sea levels ,  as well as reducing mangrove forests ,  both of which fuel sea encroachment . 
mangrove forests absorb the seas wave energy ,  blocking sea encroachment . 
climate change as well as human development has decreased the indus deltas mangrove forests from <num>260,000</num>  hectares in <num>1970</num>  to just <num>86,000</num>  hectares in <num>2001</num>  , according to one study . 
according to a world wildlife fund  ( wwf )  study ,  approximately <num>4,544</num>  hectares of farmland along the fertile humbas wali creek in <num>1952</num>  have disappeared . 
ghulam akbar ,  regional director of the wwf ,  told central asia online ,  the satellite images of <num>2006</num>  and field surveys of <num>2008</num>  show that this area has now turned barren . 
farmers have had to move east ,  he said . 
wildlife is suffering too . 
acacia and prosopis forests dont thrive in salinated soil ,  and fishermen find prize species giving way to less desirable ones . 
manzur ahmad shaikh ,  district coordination officer ,  thatta ,  said ,  the government has taken up several schemes to mitigate the disaster . 
the sindh government in co-ordination with the asian development bank is working <abbr>…</abbr>  to build protective dams to check the high sea tide . 
the country is also planting mangroves on a very large scale in coordination with the iucn ,  wwf ,  and un development programme to stop further sea intrusion ,  shaikh said . 
the iucn study shows that the sea water has wiped out plants whose root systems serve as hatcheries for aquatic fauna . 
the only remedy is to allow indus river water to reach the delta ,  shaikh said . 
but dam construction upstream is stopping that water from saving the delta ,  he added . 
dams are not the only enemy ,  according to akbar ;  so is a long-standing drought . 
taliban takes its influence to karachi
pakistani plainclothes policemen display weapons recovered from suspected taliban militants in karachi november <num>12</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
security agencies in pakistan have arrested seven of the most important afghan taliban leaders ,  including muhallah abdul ghani baradar ,  in karachi . 
 [ asif hassan / afp / getty images ] 
karachi ,  pakistan - after the arrests of top-ranking al-qaeda and taliban leaders within its boundaries ,  karachi has again come under scrutiny regarding the extent of the militants influence over pakistans economic hub . 
police and analysts wonder whether the city has become a haven for terrorists . 
looking for them in karachis maze is like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack ,  said one intelligence source . 
sources add that dozens of major planners ,  commanders and shadow taliban leaders could still be in karachi . 
the same holds true for al-qaeda ,  who … have been frequenting the city for medical and financial support even before <num>9</num>  / <num>11</num>  , one observer said . 
an intelligence officer ,  speaking on condition of anonymity ,  said ,  there has been an increased movement to karachi ,  where  ( the militants )  can easily melt among the huge network of facilitators ,  financers ,  militants ,  sympathisers and sleeper cells . 
there ,  they can also avoid the intense security in balochistan ,  particularly quetta ,  where a taliban shura had been installed . 
intelligence officials said it appears the shadow taliban leadership has moved to mainland pakistan from the tribal areas ,  after the start of coalition operations in afghanistan and pakistani military action in the north west frontier province  ( nwfp ) s tribal areas . 
karachi has more than <num>3,000</num>  madrassas ,  some of which are said to be run by hard-line clerics who are purportedly brainwashing boys and young men from nwfp . 
many of their students are potential jihadis ,  said mustafa kamal ,  former mayor of karachi . 
in the past ,  osama bin laden and the reclusive taliban leader mullah omar studied in jamia binnoria . 
police arrested baradar at a madrassa . 
eight years ago ,  they found the body of kidnapped us journalist daniel pearl at the same one . 
afghan issues analyst rahimullah yusufzai said karachi has long been a safe haven for taliban but is not an operational command centre . 
with a large pashtun population ,  it is very difficult to trace  ( taliban members )  in the city ,  rahimullah said . 
only serious intelligence work can lead to them ,  he said . 
rana jawad ,  bureau chief of geo tv ,  said taliban movements into karachi can be traced back six to eight years ,  when the insurgents began to trickle into the city for medical and financial support . 
now karachi has become a city where the taliban network is entrenched fully . 
they hide where they please among the huge fellow ethnic population ,  jawad said . 
whether the al-qaeda and taliban shadow leaders have moved to karachi permanently is not known . 
according to intelligence officials ,  the taliban are known to travel to karachi in winter to escape harsh conditions that impede militant action in afghanistan . 
al-qaeda ,  the afghan taliban and the tehreek-e-taliban are known to benefit from the largesse of sympathisers in town . 
the pashtuns number around <num>3.5</num>  m in the <num>12</num>  meter -inhabitant city ,  and their virtual control of transportation ,  construction ,  and drug- and gun-running in karachi makes it a friendly city for militants ,  said an official of the federal investigation agencys special investigation unit  ( siu )  . 
the pashtun ethnic groups of the wazir-mehsud terrorist network essentially control the gun business in the country ,  and karachi is awash with weapons from darra adamkhel and orakzai agency ,  which are under the talibans control . 
officials of the fias financial crime wing estimate that the two major narcotics supply routes from nwfp-sindh and balochistan-sindh run through karachi and that the taliban receive <num>50</num>  percent of the profits from these routes . 
the suspected high density of taliban extremists in the city may have brought its population an ironic benefit . 
jihadis have spared the city from serious terrorism in the past two years because it is logistically and financially too important to them ,  said dig cid mushtaq mehr .

suspected taliban militants blew up the building in <num>2009</num>  to drive out journalists . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan - journalism has become riskier than ever in the border region between pakistan and afghanistan . 
the foreign militants who dominate the no-mans-land have no tolerance for journalists who try to inform the public . 
you are simply playing with life and death if you want to be a professional and independent journalist in any tribal district these days ,  safdar dawar ,  general secretary of the tribal union of journalists ,  told central asia online . 
five journalists have been murdered in the border region since february <num>2005</num>  .
dozens of their colleagues have fled and become internally displaced persons  ( idps )  . 
not a single murder case involving our colleagues has been investigated ,  safdar said . 
dilawar wazir ,  who works for an international broadcasting station ,  witnessed the first militant attack on journalists ,  on february <num>5</num>  , <num>2005</num>  , in wana . 
as we got closer to the main hospital ,  a car overtook us . 
allah noor wazir ,  an avt khyber tv employee ,  and amir nawab ,  a stringer for aptn ,  were killed immediately ;  anwar shakir ,  an afp correspondent ,  suffered serious injuries . 
dilawar was among many shocked journalists who left the area . 
i left wana out of security concerns and have lived away from wana since <num>2006</num>  , he said . 
zafar wazir ,  another wana journalist ,  has been living in the dera ismail khan district . 
others found new homes elsewhere . 
a long list of victims followed that attack . 
hayatullah khan ,  <num>32</num>  , was a promising tribal journalist in neighbouring north waziristan . 
he disappeared in december <num>2005</num>  ;  his bullet-riddled body turned up in the miran shah marketplace . 
his shaken colleagues were unable to obtain justice ;  his wife was later killed ,  possibly to prevent her from helping authorities find hayatullahs murderers . 
journalists noor hakim and ibrahim khan were killed in the bajaur tribal region in june <num>2007</num>  and may <num>2008</num>  , respectively . 
suspected islamist militants capped their war on reporters in the region by blowing up the press club in wana last year . 
you can survive if you follow these organisations guidelines ,   <abbr>…</abbr>  meaning they get to clear every report before it goes to the press ,  journalist muhammad saleem from bara ,  in khyber ,  told central asia online . 
the journalists are in a tough spot . 
the military wants them to call militants terrorists ,  while the militants insist on being called mujahedeen . 
it is very difficult to keep both sides happy ,  said sahibzada bhauddin ,  a journalist who has been an idp in peshawar since <num>2008</num>  .
another problem is the suspicion that the journalists might be spying for pakistani or foreign intelligence agencies . 
dawar said militants summarily kill reporters whom they consider spies . 
journalists belonging to frontier tribes also labour under archaic legal restrictions . 
the frontier crimes regulation ,  a set of laws dating to the british colonial period ,  denies members of frontier tribes rights that pakistanis elsewhere enjoy under the constitution . 
similarly ,  the countrys press and publication laws do not apply to the federally administered tribal areas . 
nobody can legally start a newspaper ,  tv channel or radio station . 
taliban militants ,  though ,  flout the law by running underground fm radio stations to terrorise residents . 
afghan transit trade :  business not as usual
peshawar - for abdul rehman zazi ,  a burly afghan tycoon from paktia ,  life has changed from a year ago . 
in july <num>2008</num>  , armed men brazenly snatched zazi from peshawars busy karkhano market as he walked to a mosque . 
zazi endured a month of captivity in the jamrud tribal region . 
he publicly thanked the government for securing his release . 
but business insiders whisper he was freed only after his captors obtained a huge ransom . 
masoom shah ,  another peshawar-based att importer ,  languished for <num>87</num>  days in captivity in <num>2008</num>  .
his family paid a ransom to free him . 
i cant tell you how much money we paid ,  said his brother kamal . 
i dont go to the mosque without a security guard . 
importers also know a colleague who was kidnapped in karachi and obtained his liberty only after his family paid a ransom in dubai . 
the pakistani militant organisation lashkar-e-jhangavi was involved ,  said a leading afghan businessman who requested anonymity . 
haji khairullah ,  a peshawar-based pakistani businessman ,  assists afghan importers ,  taking care of their imported goods in pakistan . 
his firm - haji muhammed ullah and company - transports the att goods inside pakistan after obtaining clearance by customs in the karachi seaport . 
khairullah said some afghan importers shifted their offices to dubai after a spike in kidnappings in peshawar . 
kamal shah concurred ,  saying that <num>50</num>  %  of the afghan importers ,  major jewellers ,  and currency dealers have moved their offices from peshawar ,  islamabad and lahore . 
insufficient space at the port of karachi is another disincentive for afghan merchants to stay in pakistan . 
kamal said it takes att goods <num>15</num> -<num>18</num>  days to reach karachi by ship from china . 
pakistani railways take <num>30</num>  to <num>45</num>  days to transport the same goods from karachi to peshawars dry port ,  he said . 
khairullah said such slowness has forced him and his colleagues to rely on a more expensive option - the national logistic cell ,  an official entity that transports private cargo on a commercial basis . 
att is growing nonetheless ,  said suhail . 
businessmen and a senior official in the peshawar dry port agree . 
some of the att items transported via peshawar are even going to tajikistan and uzbekistan ,  said another afghan importer who requested anonymity . 
sugar ,  food ,  and vegetable oil are much sought after in afghanistan and the central asian republics . 
according to att insiders ,  some electronics - tv sets ,  cd players ,  and air conditioners -- supposedly bound for afghanistan find their way back into pakistan in a huge smuggling racket . 
peshawar businessmen attribute the sharp att growth to tariff-dodging traders who feed att merchandise back into pakistan ,  thus escaping the high tariffs on goods legally imported into pakistan . 
such items ,  including electrical appliances ,  cosmetics ,  crockery and stationery items ,  return to pakistan illegally via unfrequented routes between the two countries . 
in some instances ,  vehicles carrying att items have disappeared inside pakistan . 
khairullah said hijackers befell a transporter carrying his companys goods to afghanistan in pakistans restive tribal region two years ago . 
i paid money to the road robbers from jamrud before they released my consignment "  ,  said khairullah .

eight to <num>12</num>  hour load shedding has not only created a number of problems for common people but also severely affected the countrys economy . 
 [ javed mahmood ] 
karachi - eight- to <num>12</num> -hour long daily blackouts are irritating pakistanis ,  but they are also a harbinger of a slowing of the countrys economic engines . 
a worsening shortage of water ,  gas and electricity has created a serious energy crisis that could set back industry and agriculture this year ,  economists and industrialists told central asia online . 
pakistan is currently facing a  ( daily )  shortfall of about 5 , 000mw of electricity in march <num>2010</num>  because of a water and gas shortage ,  khalid mahmood ,  director-general of the pakistan electric power company ,  told central asia online by phone from lahore . 
total daily generation of electricity in the country has suddenly dropped to around 8 , 000mw against a demand of 13 , 000mw ,  he said . 
one culprit is falling reservoir levels . 
with water levels at rock bottom ,  daily hydropower generation fell to 1 , 000mw on march <num>23</num>  , compared to normal levels of 6 , 000mw ,  mahmood said . 
industries are going through serious trouble ,  akbar sheikh ,  chairman of the all pakistan textile mills association ,  punjab zone ,  told central asia online . 
manufacturers find it disruptive to lose gas service for two days a week and electricity for hours . 
the textile group has asked the government to take steps before the crisis derails any prospect of economic recovery ,  sheikh said . 
industry is experiencing increased demand from international buyers ,  but the energy crisis is blocking recovery ,  he added . 
some major factories have installed their own power generation units to overcome the electricity crisis ,  but this power costs almost twice as much as the electricity being provided by the power companies . 
if the issue of corporate debt within the energy companies is settled immediately ,  it would help the government in reducing the gravity of the crisis ,  salman said . 
currently ,  the energy entities in pakistan owe about <num>1</num>  $  billion to one another ,  which is a key reason for the crisis . 
for example ,  in the third week of march ,  state-run pakistan state oil stopped delivering furnace oil for several days to the karachi electric supply company because of nonpayment of millions of dollars ,  he said . 
for many months ,  he said ,  the oil and power companies have been trading blame on their circular debt ;  they have yet to fix the problem . 
from november to april ,  gas companies face a shortage of gas and implement a load-management programme to supply gas on a priority basis to domestic consumers who lack alternate sources of energy ,  said inayatullah ismail ,  a spokesman for the sui southern gas company in karachi . 
the gas companies routinely warn managers of factories and power stations to switch to furnace or diesel oil ,  but they never do ,  he said . 
oil costs much more than natural gas . 
some indicators might bring good news with respect to hydropower generation . 
nasir jamal ,  a spokesman for the ministry of water and power ,  told central asia online that the meteorological department has predicted heavy rains for the second week of april ,  helping to replenish reservoirs . 
melting of glaciers might also help . 
since the mercury has soared above <num>40</num>  degrees celsius in unaccustomed areas ,  breaking the norm of the past three decades ,  increased snowmelt might help fill up the reservoirs too ,  he said . 
he also pointed out that by june ,  new power stations coming online will add about 2 , 000mw of electricity daily . 
girls attending an educational institute undergo training organised by the punjab civil defence department . 
educators and students have insisted the government revive scouting and civil defence training to prepare students against terrorist assaults . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore -- striving to free the country of terrorism ,  the pakistani government has established a nationwide volunteer student task force . 
the system is meant to increase the countrys capacity for treating multiple victims of terrorist acts . 
the three-day orientation will teach students how to check terrorism ,  said nawazish ali ,  spokesperson of the interior ministry ,  islamabad . 
students can register their names in nearby police stations . 
legal ,  administrative ,  police ,  academic and security experts drew up the training course . 
this course will provide information to students about terrorism and counterterrorism strategies ,  said parvez rathore ,  chief capitol police officer ,  lahore . 
it will help prepare students to identify potential threats and keep an eye on suspicious behaviour and people . 
terrorists employ students in their nefarious activities ,  often enticing them with cash incentives and exploiting their religious values . 
rathore said ,  it is high time to understand the root causes of growing terrorism in order to control <abbr>…</abbr>  the menace . 
the government has offered to issue arms licences to private schools owners ,  public sector universities representatives ,  and to train their security guards to reverse the upward spike in terrorism . 
the decision has been taken by authorities for security reasons in the wake of the military operation in south waziristan ,  said an army officer in lahore . 
there were reports that the taliban could target educational institutions ,  especially those in cantonments ,  in order to pressure the government to end the military operation in waziristan and other tribal areas . 
security experts ,  educationists and students have insisted the government revive the national cadet corps programme ,  scouting and civil defence training in educational institutes . 
students at various institutions have expressed resolve to unite against terrorists . 
terrorists want to keep students away from their studies so that the country cant progress ,  he said . 
the government is playing its role in eradicating terrorist activities ,  but civil society -- and especially the educational institutions -- should join hands with them . 
we must fight the curse of terrorism with unity instead of abandoning our studies ,  said ali khalid ,  a city school student . 
i feel that lack of proper islamic knowledge creates islamist militants . 
terrorists also misguide madrassa students by exploiting their emotions and religious values . 
he suggested that precautionary measures are important in such situations . 
liaqat bhatti ,  civil defence district officer in punjab ,  told central asia online that his department is providing civil defence training to public institute students as resources permit . 
fear is best managed by education ,  communication ,  and preparation -- not denial ,  he said . 
the training programme incorporated guiding principles on how to ward off any possible terrorist assault  ( and potential emergencies )  and provided fundamental awareness training to enable first responders to respond to terrorism safely and effectively ,  bhatti said . 
the department welcomes private institutes who wish to join the training programme ,  he said . 
bhatti said readiness can help avert a future attack on educational institutes . 
in balochistan ,  trial by fire is taken literally
a pakistani walks over hot coals in a tribal justice system known as charbeli . 
an upcoming ordeal by fire is scheduled for <num>40</num>  alleged criminals . 
the practise ,  though preferred over a jury trial by some ,  draws criticism as being cruel . 
 [ ghani kakar ] 
quetta ,  pakistan - the fierce practise of forcing alleged criminals to walk on burning coals to prove their innocence is still a tribal justice system in many parts of the countrys least literate province ,  balochistan . 
this old tribal justice system ,  sometimes called the ordeal by fire ,  is locally known as charbeli . 
it regularly draws hundreds of tribal spectators challenging the writ of state . 
adherents of this tribal system say that their faith protects them from injury and undergo the ordeal for purification ,  fulfilment of vows or proof of innocence . 
soon ,  <num>40</num>  individuals suspected of various offences will have to face this trial by fire . 
the key factor of the ordeal is the belief of the firewalker that he or she can walk over the coals without being burned . 
the head of a local jirga ,  wadera khuda bakhsh marri ,  told central asia online ,  walking on fire is a pure system of speedy justice . 
it needs nothing to explore ;  in a moment it declares the arraignment of an alleged criminal . 
the practise of walking on burning coals is still alive today because of its effectiveness ,  he added . 
in balochistan ,  the ordeal by fire is mostly experienced in settled areas ,  including jaferabad ,  jhal magsi ,  sibi ,  bolan dera bugti ,  kohlu kahan ,  dera murad jamali and related areas . 
the fire ordeal area is ten to <num>12</num>  feet long ,  and two feet wide . 
before the ordeal starts ,  a two-foot-deep furrow is dug and filled with <num>450</num>  kilogram  of dried wood . 
the wood burns two to three hours before anyone walks across it ,  doda khan said . 
when the time for the ordeal is announced ,  the alleged criminal starts walking close to the fire . 
when he finishes ,  immediately his family members or relatives take him and put him on a divan ,  where his feet are put in a pail filled with the blood of a freshly slaughtered goat or sheep ,  he added . 
doda khan said ,  a large number of people witness the fire ordeal ,  and if the fire walker is innocent ,  the burning coal will not harm him . 
if it burns his feet ,  he is found guilty and the jirga decides the further course of action against him ,  he added . 
according to news reports ,  the newly elected chief of the bugti tribe in the dear bugti district ,  mir aali bugti ,  announced a fire trial for <num>40</num>  people accused of crimes . 
a senior lawmaker kamran khan told central asia online ,  walking on fire to prove guilt is an inhuman and cruel practise and custom . 
it should be strictly prohibited . 
the law and justice commission of pakistan last year in december took notice of reported incidents of fire walking and declared it illegal ,  said kamran . 
the legal commission recommended an amendment to the pakistani penal code stipulating that someone who requires a suspect to walk on burning coals could face a fine and imprisonment of up to three years ,  he added . 
if the state does not ensure the provision of justice to its citizens ,  then i am afraid this practise would soon gain acceptance in more tribes of balochistan ,  kamran said . 
fire walking is not unique to pakistan . 
india ,  japan ,  malaya ,  fiji ,  tonga ,  samoa and tahiti practise it too ,  kamran said . 
there ,  it is believed that walking on fire is true faith practise and that it protects them from injury ,  he said . 
but i think all it happens due to a lack of awareness among the people . 
maulana muhammad hamayon ,  a religious scholar ,  said ,  walking on fire is an illicit justice system and anti-islamic tradition . 
there is not any law that could prove it fair ;  it is a man-made practise . 
the fire ordeal persists into relatively modern times as one of the phenomena of spiritualism ,  hamayon said . 
my biggest concern is that this practise is becoming urbanised and gaining more adherents . 
there is a need for awareness among the people to abandon and not believe in such exercises . 
major offensive in kandahar in the offing
afghan president hamid karzai  ( centre right )  speaks to locals during a shura in kandahar april <num>4</num>  .
karzai pledged that tribal leaders would be consulted before any coalition push to oust the taliban from their spiritual home in southern afghanistan starts . 
kandahar is seen as the key battleground to reverse nearly nine years of escalating conflict in afghanistan . 
 [ golnar motevalli / afp / getty images ] 
kandahar -- a long planned offensive in kandahar ,  the birthplace of the taliban ,  will start soon ,  but president hamid karzai ,  told tribal elders april <num>4</num>  they would be consulted before it is launched . 
coalition officials say the operation will be afghan-led and similar to the one that targeted marjah and other areas in helmand province . 
president hamid karzai ,  visited kandahar april <num>4</num>  and told the tribal elders would be consulted before any effort to oust the taliban occurs . 
kandahar ,  the spiritual home of and the taliban ,  has been a battlefield for the past eight years between afghan-coalition forces and the taliban . 
afghan and coalition officials have not yet announced a start date for the offensive ,  but media reports say the operation will begin in june . 
according to sources ,  afghan and coalition forces are working hard to secure transit routes and persuade the leaders of surrounding districts to cooperate with the forces . 
coalition-led forces in afghanistan have urged local residents not to flee their homes ahead of the offensive . 
according to afghan sources ,  around <num>10,000</num>  troops will be taking part in the operation in kandahar ,  which they say will be different from the marjah offensive . 
the kandahar operation is part of a <num>12</num> -to-18-month push to drive taliban militants out of their strongholds across the country . 
taliban spokesman qari yousuf ahmadi said ,  the kandahar military operations will fail like those in marjah . 
we have <num>70</num> -<num>80</num>  %  control of kandahar province now . 
more than <num>15,000</num>  afghan and nato-led troops launched an operation in marjah february <num>13</num>  and regained control of the district from the taliban . 
in the past few years ,  it has been clarified that a major part of kandahar residents are unhappy with the afghan government ,  so international and afghan forces are now struggling to conduct an offensive in order to restore good governance in kandahar ,  helaluddin said . 
najib parwiz ,  spokesman for the kandahar governor ,  told central asia online that local authorities have urged the coalition forces to conduct any kandahar operation with professional restraint . 
we are working with local tribal elders to help the afghan-led forces in the operation against militants and we have asked the afghan and nato forces to avoid civilian causalities ,  he said . 
several schools reopen in marjah
a teacher in southern afghanistan works with students on a lesson . 
at least three schools reopened in marjah ,  helmand ,  after security forces ousted the taliban . 
the reopening of the schools is part of the reconstruction plan for the area . 
 [ ministry of education ,  afghanistan ] 
kabul - at least three schools have reopened in the town of marjah ,  in the southern afghan province of helmand as part of a long-term overall development plan for the region . 
the town and much of the province were under control of the taliban for many years ,  during which all schools were closed . 
in february ,  thousands of afghan and international troops ousted the taliban from marjah to pave way for a comprehensive reconstruction plan . 
immediately after the operation ended ,  the international community and afghan government started implementing development programmes in the town . 
afghan president hamid karzai ,  british prime minister gordon brown ,  and many others were among the high-ranking officials who visited marjah to implement rebuilding plans . 
muhammad wali khan ,  deputy director of the department of education in helmand ,  told central asia online the government reopened three schools in marjah several days ago . 
many others are under construction or being renovated . 
there were many schools in marjah before the taliban took control ,  khan said . 
the insurgents closed all of them in an effort to keep the local population deprived of education because ignorant youth are more vulnerable to exploitation . 
a provincial official told central asia online that the three new schools will provide education to about <num>500</num>  children . 
he said the number of children being educated will sharply increase as more schools open . 
the provincial official added that for the first time girls will be able to go to schools in marjah . 
according to this official ,  helmand has about <num>300</num>  schools but only about <num>100</num>  are functioning now because the taliban burned or closed down many of them ,  particularly in remote districts . 
those schools that remain open have about <num>60,000</num>  students ,  the official said . 
gul ahmad ,  a resident of marjah whose son is studying in one of the schools ,  expressed his happiness about the reconstruction efforts . 
we are very happy that the schools are being rebuilt and opened ,  he said . 
when my son reached school age ,  there were no schools in marjah . 
it made me very sad and hopeless for my childrens future . 
but now i see him going to school and it makes me so happy . 
pashtun nation rises against militancy
young pashtuns dance to a drumbeat in peshawar . 
such scenes were rare under islamic militants who banned music and dance in pakistans tribal areas and the north west frontier province . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar -- signs of the pashtun nations rise against islamic militancy are becoming more visible . 
young and old pashtuns brushed aside security concerns and danced to a drumbeat outside a community hall april <num>6</num>  to celebrate their culture - and the proposed renaming of the north west frontier province to khyber-pakhtoonkhwa . 
we have awakened to take on this challenge - islamic militancy ,  a jubilant young tribesman from north waziristan told central asia online after a group of young and old pashtuns finished dancing . 
they were awaiting the start of a meeting convened to pass a declaration against terrorism on pashtun lands . 
the declaration ,  which passed ,  was a show of solidarity ,  a sign of defiance ,  and the pashtuns rejection of extremism . 
the pashtuns endured a decade of terror by militants who conducted kidnappings for ransom and public floggings . 
in addition ,  pakistani taliban militants linked to al-qaeda and the afghan taliban banned girls education and womens employment wherever they held sway . 
under the taliban ,  thousands of pashtuns in different tribal regions and the rest of the country were killed . 
the militants demolished muslim and christian houses of worship ,  and attacked the funerals of their foes . 
the pashtuns <abbr>…</abbr>  whisper that they and their culture are under attack from islamic militants ,  syed alam mehsud ,  a staunch anti-taliban amn jirga activist ,  told central asia online . 
analysts say this realisation is making the pashtun community stronger against its enemy . 
no doubt ,  there is a rise of the pashtun nation against militancy ,  pashtun researcher khadim hussain said . 
the pashtun nation will uproot the militancy from its areas if the government stands by the pashtuns ,  he added . 
the government appears to be taking note . 
its military offensives in swat ,  bajaur and south waziristan have raised pashtun morale . 
ongoing military action in orakzai tribal district since march <num>24</num>  has taken the war to the militants home ground . 
the government also is helping pashtuns on the public relations front . 
to repair the pashtuns image ,  which has become associated with terrorism ,  the government has released the teleplay la ta zaar sha  ( love you to death )  and the video songbook drund pashtun  ( proud pashtun )  . 
the teleplay revolves around a pashtun family headed by malik dauran . 
tragedy strikes the wealthy and respected patriarch when militants drive him from his home ,  his oldest son is killed in an explosion ,  his second son goes insane as a result ,  and his youngest son joins a militant group as a prospective suicide bomber before having a fateful meeting with his parents . 
the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  secretariat drew up the campaign to promote the pashtuns image . 
the premiere of the teleplay and video songbook will help the world know  ( their )  real face . 
this genocide  ( against the pashtun nation )  has to be stopped ,  he said . 
pashtun society is resolute when aroused but tends to wait for a chagha - a loud call for support . 
a case in point occurred in early <num>2007</num>  in the ahmedzai wazir areas of south waziristan . 
the uzbek militants wrecked our lives ,  but nobody was ready to take up arms against them ,  hafiz wazir ,  a wana-based tribal journalist ,  told central asia online . 
however ,  once  ( mullah nazir )  did it ,  the ahmedzai wazir tribes united behind him to flush out the uzbeks . 
the proposed renaming will give the pashtuns their identity ,  security and development scholar khalid aziz said . 
in the absence of identity ,  a nation does not progress . 
this is the problem with the pashtun nation at the moment . 
in this file photo ,  hijacked trucks load with goods are shown in the talibans control in khyber agency . 
kidnapping ,  robberies and drug-running are some of the significant sources of taliban funding . 
 [ mehmood jan ] 
karachi - crime begets crime ;  at least that maxim holds true for the tehrik-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  ,  which commits crime to finance terrorist acts . 
the ttp operates through a countrywide underground network of sleeper cells ,  financers ,  facilitators ,  sympathisers and affiliates that help the organisation achieve its intended objectives through vital financing . 
senior intelligence and law enforcement officials say <num>20</num>  %  of ttp funding comes from crimes  ( including kidnappings and bank robberies )  ;  <num>50</num>  %  comes from donations and extortions ;  and the remaining <num>30</num>  %  is drug money . 
not a day goes without a number of kidnappings being staged by the taliban or its affiliates . 
karachi and peshawar remain the most vulnerable cities . 
the ttp acts on its own in areas under its influence in the north west frontier province and federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  ;  the group operates through a network of affiliates such as the harkatul mujaideen and al badr mujahideen elsewhere . 
fifty kidnappings daily became routine at one point ,  according to a frontier-based intelligence officer . 
the kidnappers would demand ransom in millions ,  and in the absence of effective police action ,  the victims family would deliver the ransom ,  he said . 
those were crazy times ,  and nobody was safe . 
even a close relative of inspector general islamabad kaleem imam was ransomed for rs <num>5</num>  meter   ( us <num>59,571</num>  $  )  after being kidnapped from peshawar . 
the same thing happened to the vice chancellor of kohat university . 
in <num>2008</num> -<num>2009</num>  , the karachi police detected a spike in taliban-orchestrated bank robberies and kidnappings . 
in october <num>2008</num>  , abductors held film producer satish anand for six months near matta ,  swat ,  an area that was under the control of a taliban group led by mullah fazlullah . 
jameel yusuf ,  a security consultant and former chief of the citizen police liaison committee who negotiated anands release ,  said the taliban received rs <num>1.68</num>  meter   ( us <num>20,016</num>  $  )  ransom for this kidnapping . 
the ransom payment was made in islamabad ,  he said . 
in the same period ,  kidnappers seized two other businessmen . 
one returned after payment of ransom ,  while the  ( other )  ,  shaukat afridi ,  who ran a fleet of nato tanker trucks ,  was killed in a bombing during an abortive rescue attempt ,  yusuf said . 
of the dozen bank robberies that occurred in karachi in <num>2009</num>  , <num>80</num>  %  could be traced back to individuals based in the tribal areas who are believed to be working for the ttp ,  according to the federal interior ministry . 
in <num>2008</num>  , officials tracked a heist of rs <num>150</num>  meter   ( us <num>150</num>  meter  )  from a money exchange company in karachi to now-deceased ttp leader baitullah mehsud . 
on finding clues ,  the owners of the money exchange company approached the ttp leadership in waziristan and asked mehsud to return the money . 
later reports confirmed that mehsud gave some of the money back . 
many shadowy donations flow into pakistan through both normal and illegal  ( like hawala ,  hundi and chamak )  banking channels ,  said an official of the federal investigation agency crime department . 
the donations come mostly from the middle east and europe and are destined for feigned islamic charities that act as fronts for the militant organisations . 
in most cases ,  extremist organisations have welfare wings like jamat-ud-dawa ,  a front for lashkar-e-taiba . 
jamat-ud-dawa collects funds for schools and clinics it runs ,  but most donations finance the militancy . 
during the <num>2005</num>  earthquake ,  strong sentiment to help earthquake victims provided a rare opportunity for terrorists to exploit a huge influx of cash . 
the father of rashid rauf ,  a terrorist on britains most wanted list ,  ran a london philanthropic organisation ,  the crescent society . 
this organisation donated <num>54</num>  meter  pounds  ( us <num>54</num>  meter  )  to pakistans <num>2005</num>  earthquake victims ,  said federal officials ,  who added that police traced the donations to a pakistani bank account operated by a housemaid in rashid raufs household . 
the ttp also receive their share from the drugs that cross into pakistans north west frontier and balochistan provinces ,  rana jawad ,  islamabad bureau chief of geo tv ,  told central asia online . 
government battles taliban's campaign against polio vaccinations
acting district co-ordination officer naeem akhtar  ( left )  administers a polio vaccination in swat . 
with the taliban out of power ,  authorities resumed vaccinating against polio there in november <num>2009</num>  for the first time in <num>18</num>  months . 
 [ ashfaq yusufzai ] 
peshawar - the taliban has kept millions of pakistani children from receiving polio vaccinations ,  calling them a western plot . 
now the children run the risk of disability and death . 
we didnt have vaccination teams for the past two years because of taliban opposition ,  lamented swat resident irshad ali . 
my son didnt receive vaccine and is crippled now . 
last october ,  medics confirmed that then-14-month-old javed ali had polio . 
efforts by the world health organisation  ( who )  and the government to eradicate polio have run afoul of the talibans opposition in khyber pakhtunkhwa and the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  . 
last year doctors confirmed polio in <num>20</num>  children in swat and <num>14</num>  in bajaur agency . 
none of the victims had received the vaccine ,  which the taliban bans in areas it controls . 
polio vaccine is a tool of the west to render recipients sterile and to reduce the muslim population ,  swat valley taliban spokesman muslim khan said before authorities arrested him last september . 
muslims should wait until they contract the disease before seeking treatment ,  he said . 
some medics have become casualties of militants while fighting the disease . 
in <num>2007</num>  , bajaur agency surgeon abdul ghani khan and two vaccinators were killed in a roadside blast while returning from a polio-related function . 
taliban intimidation and conspiracy theories have undercut the countrys struggle to comply with the whos polio eradication initiative ,  which began in <num>1994</num>  .
the country saw improvement this decade before taliban control of khyber paktunkhwa and fata caused the number of cases to rise again ,  from a historic low of <num>28</num>  nationwide cases in <num>2005</num>  , to <num>117</num>  in <num>2008</num>  .
it subsided to <num>89</num>  in <num>2009</num>  .
khyber pakhtunkhwa and fata accounted for <num>49</num>  cases in <num>2009</num>  .
as of april <num>18</num>  , pakistan has recorded <num>12</num>  cases this year ,  including four from fata and three from khyber paktunkhwa . 
elsewhere ,  the who has sent a team to tajikistan to investigate a polio outbreak . 
radio free europe / radio liberty reported on april <num>25</num>  that the disease had killed ten tajik children . 
the source of that outbreak is not known ,  but tajikistan borders pakistan and afghanistan . 
those countries had the third and fourth most cases worldwide of polio  ( <num>89</num>  and <num>38</num>  , respectively )  in <num>2009</num>  .
i would have taken my daughter for vaccination outside bajaur ,  had i known the repercussions ,  her father ,  rahmanuddin ,  told central asia online . 
now my daughter will be disabled her whole life . 
he also blasted the militant claim that the vaccine contains anti-fertility agents . 
the vaccine is procured by unicef ,  which met the specifications set by the expert committee on biological standardization ,  he said . 
more than a billion children have received the vaccine over the past <num>22</num>  years without any reported side effects ,  he added . 
taliban leader maulana fazalullah railed against the opv and forbade medics from administering vaccines ,  recalled ali ,  father of the <num>14</num> -month-old polio victim in swat . 
in some areas ,  local hard-line clerics have taken up the talibans cause ,  ordering parents to avoid the opv . 
it is part of an anti-muslim agenda of eliminating the  ( muslim )  race ,  prayer leader gul rehman said in par hoti mardan during an april <num>23</num>  sermon . 
the government has persuaded other religious leaders to speak in favour of vaccination . 
parents should inoculate their children against any disease as it is their religious responsibility ,  maulana jalal shah ,  in south waziristan ,  said in a decree issued early this year . 
besides the government and the un ,  a dozen countries have provided <num>1.5</num>  $  billion per year to fight the crippling ailment in pakistan . 
but the health ministry had to put off the polio campaign in bajaur agency in august <num>2009</num>  after armed men beat up vaccinators in the charmang area . 
the situation is improving ,  though ,  said dr mujahid hussain ,  the top polio officer in khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
in swat ,  we have vaccinated all <num>365,000</num>  children after the eviction of the taliban . 
end militancy ,  and the situation will improve ,  he said . 
sufi islam counters militants' version of islam
pakistanis dance during a celebration of sufi artists ,  who are noted for being peace-loving people . 
 [ m . 
ibrahim ] 
sufi islam has nothing to do with swords or guns ,  said abaseen yousafzai ,  a pakhtoon poet and intellectual . 
in addition to yousafzai ,  afghan cultural attache parveen malal and prof taha khan attended an april <num>29</num>  seminar in karachi to pay tribute to the pakhtoon sufi poet rehman baba  ( <num>1653</num> -<num>1711</num>  )  . 
sufi islam has nothing to do with violence ,  bukhari told central asia online by phone . 
the way of the sufi ,  he said ,  is to leave the scene of conflict to avoid violence and the slaughter of innocents . 
the taliban are khawarij ,  bukhari said ,  evoking those who fought against the fourth caliph ,  hazrat ali . 
 ( the taliban )  also love to destroy and kill . 
instead of using armed force ,  it is time to explore other avenues like sufism to bring peace to the region ,  yousafzai said . 
sufi religious leaders and poets like rehman ,  khushal and hamza baba enjoy respect and influence amongst the local population . 
rehman baba ,  nearly <num>300</num>  years after his death ,  could play a vital role in bringing peace to the pakhtoon lands ,  consisting of afghanistan ,  khyber pakhtunkhwa and the federally administered tribal areas ,  they said . 
peace and love infuse every line of rehman babas poetry ,  helping readers rise above racial ,  geographical ,  tribal and national prejudices ,  yousafzai said . 
sufi poets possess a distinguished place in pakhtoon society and have a visible impact on daily life ,  he added . 
rehman baba is probably the best known afghan poet ,  even after the passage of three centuries ,  malal ,  a poet herself ,  said . 
his effusions are of a religious or moral character and mainly concern the subject of divine love ,  touched with the mysticism of sufism ,  malal said . 
rehman babas poetry stands on the three basic foundations of sufism :  morality ,  knowledge and divine love ,  said taha khan ,  who translated rehman babas entire oeuvre into urdu . 
the poet is considered a great social reformer ,  since his every verse preaches peace and virtue ,  the professor added . 
modern-day pakhtoon poets strive to uphold the sufi traditions of high human virtues and positive social ethics for effective social change in their poetry ,  zafar kareemi ,  a pakhtoon poet associated with jaras adabi jirga ,  said . 
international observers ,  including those within think tanks like rand and the heritage foundation ,  also suggest supporting sufism to counter the taliban and to bring peace to the region ,  he told central asia online . 
the solution to todays militancy is sufi islam ,  bukhari said . 
afghan refugees in karachi face trifecta of woes
about <num>60</num>  %  of afghan refugees make rugs by hand in the settlements . 
the pakistani carpet-making industry says <num>80</num>  %  of its employees are refugees . 
as more return to afghanistan ,  the industry will suffer ,  carpet traders say . 
karachi - between the soviet invasion of the <num>1980</num>  second  and the rule of the taliban in the late <num>1990</num>  second  ,  many afghans fled their homeland for the greener pastures of pakistan . 
a recent visit to a makeshift refugee camp near karachi made clear authorities have shipped a large number of legal and illegal afghan refugees back to their native land . 
the government has cracked down on refugees because of ongoing terrorist activities in pakistan - especially attacks on military installations . 
that is the main reason authorities have deported so many afghan refugees ,  said haji sohrab ,  the official representative of afghan refugees appointed by the afghan consulate in karachi . 
police deny arresting refugees with por cards . 
we arrest the illegal afghan immigrants under the foreign act ,  as well as refugees involved in crimes ,  local police officer shehzad hussain told central asia online . 
registered refugees who willingly return to afghanistan receive an assistance ,  transport and reintegration package ,  including a grant of nearly us <num>100</num>  $  , according to asif shehzad ,  a unhcr spokesman in pakistan . 
that incentive has helped boost the numbers of voluntary repatriations ,  he added . 
the crackdown on refugees comes even though they are allowed to stay in pakistan until december <num>2012</num>  , according to a tripartite agreement among afghanistan ,  pakistan and unhcr . 
afghans hailing from the bordering provinces of kandahar ,  nuristan and helmand are reluctant to return to their homeland ,  though . 
a majority of the returning refugees belong to northern provinces like mazar-i sharif and herat ,  where the security situation is better ,  arshad khan ,  <num>45</num>  , an ethnic pashtun refugee from helmand ,  said . 
but how can we willingly return to places like helmand and kandahar ,  knowing how bad the security situation is there ? 
as part of the crackdown ,  industries are being forced not to hire foreign workers without documentation ;  that mandate has created employment problems for the refugees ,  hafeez told central asia online . 
one industry that remains unaffected ,  though ,  is rug-making . 
almost <num>60</num>  %  of the refugees - men ,  women and children - are forced to make carpets by hand in the camp ,  residents of the settlement say . 
the carpet industry of pakistan employs many refugees - up to <num>80</num>  %  of its workforce . 
as more afghans are repatriated ,  the carpet-making industry will suffer ,  carpet traders in karachi predicted . 
camp living conditions are deplorable ,  the residents complained . 
they argue that the refugee settlements in karachi look like destroyed areas of afghanistan . 
the settlements dont meet basic living standards ,  and some dont even offer safe drinking water ,  residents said . 
no government official has bothered to visit the camp to assess the situation ,  ahmed bismillah khan ,  a camp resident ,  said . 
most of the houses in the camp are made of mud bricks and there is not a single health facility ,  the residents said . 
residents also complained that no education is available ;  instead ,  barefoot children play in the streets most of the day . 
though millions of dollars were directed from the un and other organisations for the betterment of the afghan refugees living here ,  the government seems to have turned a blind eye to the complaints from their refugee camps ,  where no services or facilities available ,  hotak said . 
global warming threatens pakistan

pakistans himalayan glaciers may disappear in <num>40</num>  to <num>50</num>  years because of global warming ,  causing serious water shortages . 
 [ paula bronstein  / getty images ] 
karachi -- like in much of the world ,  climate change is threatening pakistans water resources and crop production ,  and forcing policymakers to develop measures to adapt . 
of the <num>5,000</num>  glaciers in the region ,  <num>90</num>  %  are in various degrees of melting ,  putting a question mark on the future of water resources in an already stressed situation ,  said amber masood of the un development programme glacier project . 
in pakistan ,  the most dangerous aspect of glacial melting is the large lakes left behind ,  potential sources of destructive flooding . 
scientists have identified <num>2,420</num>  glacial lakes as glacial lakes outburst floods  ( glofs )  in gilgit baltistan . 
of those ,  <num>52</num>  are potentially dangerous to the populations living below . 
temperatures in the range of <num>30</num>  degree  celsius are invading higher peaks and leading to melting ,  said ghulam rasool ,  a climatologist in pakistan . 
in addition to glacial melting and glofs ,  we are witnessing an extremely disturbed rain pattern ,  said dr qamaruzaman chaudhry ,  director general pakistan meteorology . 
in <num>2009</num>  , the rainfall was greatly reduced and highly erratic ,  chaudhry said . 
last year ,  both the summer and the winter rains decreased by <num>30</num>  %  each . 
the water supply to dams was also slashed ,  badly hurting hydroelectricity production and reducing power supply to many parts of the country ,  leading to urban riots . 
the drought and shrinking reservoirs also hurt agricultural productivity . 
cotton ,  rice ,  sugarcane and maize yields fell by various degrees . 
meteorologists are forecasting an erratic monsoon rainfall in <num>2010</num>  also . 
though very initial ,  it appears the rainfall like that of last year will be sporadic ,  irregular and intermittent but extremely heavy and in torrents ,  leading to urban flooding scenarios ,  rasool said . 
the arabian sea is also rising ,  though only by a few millimetres and insignificantly ,  rasool said . 
climatologists are linking the sea level rise to increasing temperatures in the northern arabian sea . 
the coastal areas of balochistan and sindh witnessed ferocious rains in <num>2007</num>  .
this phenomenon represents a major shift in weather . 
previously cyclones were formed only in the bay of bengal ,  but now more are developing in the northern arabian sea and very few in the bay of bengal ,  rasool said . 
because of this change ,  in <num>2009</num>  heavy rains occurred again in the coastal zones of pakistan ,  he said . 
higher-than-average summer temperatures have occurred ,  too . 
the met office confirmed that the summer of <num>2009</num>  was a sizzler in which the average temperature shot up by <num>5</num> -<num>7</num>  degree  celsius . 
due to global warming there has been an average temperature increase in the last five years ,  chaudhry told central asia online . 
this average broke the <num>60</num> -year record for the city ,  he said . 
a similar trend has occurred in winter . 
winters generally last until march ,  but this time the frosty winter ,  like last year ,  lengthened by two weeks in gilgit baltistan ,  and the cloud cover continues to hang in the catchment areas of dams . 
this has delayed melting of snow ,  leaving reservoirs nearly empty and delaying the planting of crops like potato and maize ,  chaudhry said . 
gene revolution plan to improve pakistans crop yields
in this october <num>8</num>  , photo ,  a pakistani farmer picks cotton in central punjab . 
cotton production has declined through a lack of innovation ,  poor marketing and failure to pay farmers on time . 
the new gene revolution plan is expected to double production of major crops in pakistan . 
karachi -- pakistani farmers should soon have the ability to double crop production ,  according to the government . 
the governments gene revolution plan  ( grp )  seeks to double production of major crops ,  especially cotton and maize ,  by increasing use of genetically modified seed ,  officials of the ministry of food and agriculture told central asia online . 
bt cotton is genetically modified cotton that contains a gene from bacillus thuringiensis ,  a naturally occurring soil bacteria . 
the gene produces a toxin that only kills insects ,  reducing the need for chemical insecticides . 
bt has been widely used for many years to control mosquitoes without harm to humans or the environment . 
in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  the production of cotton increased to <num>14</num>  meter  bales . 
overall production of this major cash crop is expected to rise to <num>18</num> -<num>20</num>  meter  bales as farmers switch to bt cotton ,  he said . 
two years ago the government launched the grp experimentally . 
its success has encouraged the government to implement it vigorously starting this year ,  baloch said . 
in april the pakistani government signed a memorandum of understanding with monsanto to continue discussions to introduce an advanced bt cotton variety the company has developed . 
the deal is potentially worth us <num>20</num>  meter  ,  and would further improve yields . 
efforts are also under way to use modified seeds to increase production of wheat ,  maize and other crops ,  he said . 
the government will provide seed plants ,  machinery and certified seeds to the farmers ,  he added . 
pakistan often faces a shortfall of wheat ,  sugar and cotton ,  but the cultivation of genetically modified crops should lead to complete crop self-reliance in four to five years ,  he said . 
the government intends to ensure that those who use the miracle seeds pay for them . 
a bill is being introduced to ban cultivation of crops if it violates intellectual property rights ,  baloch said . 
if parliament passes the law ,  authorities will issue government-certified seeds to farmers ,  he said . 
the government should make efforts to fast-track … the cultivation of genetically modified crops on a large scale in pakistan to double crop production and to bring about a green revolution ,  said hamid malhi ,  president of the basmati growers association ,  punjab . 
he urged the government to distribute modified seeds free to farmers to achieve a breakthrough in the production of crops under the grp . 
continuing to import seeds would increase pakistan's import bill and its dependence on foreign firms ,  he said . 
he also suggested developing a strong framework to ensure a fair return to growers in the future . 
such protection is essential because farmers suffer heavy losses whenever they overproduce any crop ,  he said . 
he cited wheat as an example . 
pakistan is expected to have <num>4</num>  meter  tonnes more than its annual requirement of <num>22</num>  meter  tonnes in <num>2010</num>  - from a combination of surplus production and last year's stockpiles . 
terror takes economic toll on pakistan

islamic militancy and terror have hit the countrys economy hard . 
 [ rizwan tabassum / afp / getty images ] 
first of two parts
islamabad - pakistanis first predicted their country would come through the post-september <num>11</num>  , <num>2001</num>  , global economic crisis virtually unscathed . 
and why not ? 
the countrys economy bounced back with robust growth by <num>2005</num>  .
pakistan surmounted problems like insufficient power and inconsistent agricultural reforms to report an annual growth rate of <num>7</num> -<num>8</num>  %  in its gross domestic product  ( gdp )  . 
but now ,  things look a little less rosy ,  and the main reason is pakistans extended war against militants . 
if you ask me what damage my province had as a result of the war on terror during the past three years ,  i can say it was irreparable ,  said aqil shah ,  a senior leader of the awami national party and khyber pakhtunkhwa minister for culture and tourism . 
of the countrys provinces ,  khyber pakhtunkhwa took the biggest blow from the militancy and had an influx of afghan refugees . 
 ( the war on terror )  damaged <num>200</num>  years worth of culture in my province and eroded every source of income ,  aqil said . 
the numbers seem to support aqils assessment that things took a turn for the worse three years ago . 
the war on terror started to hit pakistans economy in <num>2007</num>  and it took over completely in early <num>2008</num>  .
by december <num>2009</num>  , terror had damaged every sector of the countrys economy . 
the numbers are staggering . 
on the gdp front ,  the state bank of pakistan reported that pakistans gdp growth declined from <num>9</num>  %  in <num>2004</num> -<num>05</num>  to <num>2.4</num>  %  in <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  .
as the taliban increased its attacks ,  key trade partners issued travel advisories ,  sometimes forbidding businessmen and travellers to visit pakistan . 
in <num>2008</num>  and <num>2009</num>  , pakistans industrial base saw one-third of its factories close down . 
with a loss of jobs and the lack of foreign investment ,  domestic revenue collections fell ,  pushing pakistan into a debt trap . 
ashfaq hasan khan ,  an advisor to the finance ministry from <num>2000</num> -<num>2008</num>  , recalled how then-president pervez musharrafs administration reacted . 
the economic nosedive in <num>2008</num>  came in conjunction with the launch of military operations in the former north west frontier province . 
that offensive fanned the fires of the taliban insurrection . 
militants did not welcome the prospect of having the war come to their strongholds ,  so they took it to the cities . 
the infighting left <num>3.5</num>  meter  homeless in what is now khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
they acquired the status of internally displaced persons ,  burdening the federal government with the cost of feeding and sheltering them . 
the islamabad government was already struggling to pay for the war on terror from its weakened financial state .

second of two parts
islamabad - for years ,  the economic indicators have fallen . 
foreign direct investment has dropped off precipitously ;  infrastructure has fallen into ruin and the country doesnt have the money to fix things ;  and industrial output plunged as factories closed . 
now ,  though ,  rana asad amin ,  additional secretary of the ministry of finance ,  foresees an economic recovery for pakistan . 
he is not alone . 
aqil shah owns hotels in khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
one hotel in swat - the most troubled city in pakistan - came under attack twice . 
as minister of tourism and culture of the provincial government ,  i conveyed to the federal government in writing that my province has suffered us <num>2010</num>  in losses during the past three years ,  aqil said . 
but he said <num>2010</num>  is going to bring things back to normality in his province . 
we are going to have normal days in our province this year ,  and so ,  we are arranging a number of programmes ,  including see peshawar … and cultural activities in khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  he said . 
there has been a significant reduction in terror activities in the northern region of pakistan ,  and it is going to help the economy to resume its upward trend in the coming years ,  said ashfaq hasan khan ,  who served as an advisor to the finance ministry from <num>2000</num> -<num>2008</num>  .
pakistan bounced back by <num>2005</num>  from the worldwide slowdown that came after the september <num>11</num>  , <num>2001</num>  , terrorist attacks . 
this area is historically controlled by tribal leaders ,  and the peoples disputes are decided by the jirgas ,  kamran said . 
the war on terror was a nightmare for all of pakistan ,  but especially for his agency . 
since the beginning of the war on terror ,  the tribal belt has been hit worst by the taliban ,  and as a consequence ,  there seems to be no progress in the already-backward northern area of pakistan in the future ,  kamran said . 
education is a big challenge . 
the taliban targeted schools in the region ,  leaving no chance for todays children to be a vibrant and useful citizen of pakistan in the future ,  he said . 
many of those who could afford it have settled elsewhere in pakistan to ensure schooling for their children . 
but thats not a solution to the problem because the entire population cannot migrate from the tribal area ,  kamran said . 
its very difficult to come up with an exact mathematical calculation of how much of an effect the war on terror has had on the pakistani economy ,  shafqat said . 
but one thing that is clear . 
pakistan will keep on paying the price as investment ,  exports  ( and other economic factors )  are affected for years to come . 
rana is working up an economic assessment for pakistan and is negotiating different loans with international donors ,  including the international monetary fund ,  who attribute pakistans economic woes to the war on terror . 
he claims that had pakistan not forced to be a front-line fighter ,  its economy would not be hostage to domestic and foreign debt . 
rana regrets that the world community did not meet pakistans stated expectations in terms of assistance in recent years . 
pakistans economic woes were multiplying as a result of indifference from its friends ,  who did not fulfil their commitments <abbr>…</abbr>  to help pakistan take on the challenges posed by the war on terror up front ,  rana said . 
our foreign business partners were not ready to come to pakistan for business deals ,  as they prefer to stay in dubai or at some other place outside pakistan and call us there for any business discussion ,  moeenuddin said . 
although some pakistanis foresee <num>2010</num>  as a turning point for the economy ,  lingering problems make the recovery a challenge . 
it likely will require a united front involving business leaders ,  government officials and others to overcome . 
the ahmedzai wazir tribe wants to expel mehsud militants from its areas . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar -- about <num>300</num>  tribal chieftains pledged during a may <num>10</num>  tribal jirga to keep militants loyal to the hakeemullah mehsud-led tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  out of ahmedzai wazir areas . 
ahmedzai wazir areas are in the west of south waziristan ,  close to the afghan border . 
the wazir tribes have escaped clashes between security forces and militants ,  and attacks on state installations ,  since the spring of <num>2007</num>  , when the local population rose up against foreign militants ,  especially uzbeks . 
the government has been alarmed by reports that mehsud militants are coming to wana ,  syed ghafoor shah ,  a senior government official ,  told the jirga ,  according to local journalist hafeez wazir . 
now it all depends on you what you want - to keep peace or let it be destroyed . 
government officials said at the may <num>10</num>  jirga in wana that mehsud militants are hiding among mehsud refugees ,  a situation that could threaten the peace in the wazir areas . 
we have conveyed our concern to the tribes ,  and  ( we )  hope they will help maintain this peace ,  shah said . 
indications are that some mehsud militant commanders and foot soldiers have trimmed their long hair and live with families as internally displaced persons  ( idps )  ,  a zalikhel tribal elder said . 
the wazir areas also live with militant influence ,  but the residents generally oppose the ttp and uzbek militants . 
we want to keep peace in our areas at all costs ,  malik behram khan ,  a tribal elder ,  said . 
we have fought against the uzbek militants to achieve this peace ,  influential tribal chieftain malik noor ali agreed during the jirga . 
ahmedzai wazir areas have seen a dramatic turnaround in the past seven years . 
the pakistan military first launched strikes against fleeing taliban and al-qaeda elements here in late <num>2003</num>  .
militant commander nek muhammad led counter-attacks ,  resulting in a peace deal with the government in march <num>2004</num>  .
a missile attack three months later killed him . 
baitullah mehsud - a ttp leader later slain by a missile - allowed uzbek militants to stay with him after tribesmen chased them out of the ahmedzai wazir areas . 
that decision angered the ahmedzai wazir ,  who pressed mullah nazir ,  a militant commander from the wazir areas ,  to stay away from any ttp alliance . 
encouraged by the peaceful situation in the ahmedzai wazir areas ,  the government has approved reconstruction money for  " quick impact projects "  in tribal areas ,  including us <num>2004</num>  . for roads ,  electricity and water . 
kidnapping is lucrative source of funding for taliban
in this october <num>2008</num>  file photo ,  afghan intelligence service personnel show a dry well in kabul where kidnappers held the son of a banker and a relative of zafir shah ,  the late king . 
police rescued both men . 
kidnapping for ransom has become a significant source of taliban funding . 
kabul -- taliban militants across afghanistan have been kidnapping foreigners and afghan nationals to make money ,  local afghans and government officials told central asia online . 
early this week ,  officials in the south-eastern ghazni province said the taliban had kidnapped a dozen afghans on charges of spying for the government and foreign forces . 
early this week ,  officials in the south-eastern ghazni province said the taliban had kidnapped a dozen afghans on charges of spying for the government and foreign forces . 
col ghani khan ,  a ghazni police officer ,  said the militants seized their victims from the andar district and elsewhere in the province . 
the militants use the tactic to spread fear ,  discourage citizens from working with the government ,  and make money ,  he and a local resident said . 
eventually ,  they ask for money when the families of the abductees contact the militants . 
this is a business for them ,  said amanullah khan ,  a ghazni resident . 
ghazni was also the province where the taliban kidnapped <num>23</num>  south koreans in july <num>2007</num>  .
the militants killed two of the abductees to force the korean and afghan governments into a deal . 
the abductors traded the surviving koreans for the release of several taliban prisoners . 
later ,  though ,  a taliban commander ,  ustad mohammad yasir ,  told a pashtu magazine in peshawar the taliban received a large sum of money for the release . 
kidnapping of foreigners and local nationals has become a lucrative business for the taliban ,  said an afghan official ,  speaking on condition of anonymity . 
people are kidnapped and then released for money . 
in some places ,  there are networks of criminals who kidnap people and then sell them to the taliban . 
the taliban make videos and send them to hostages governments and families . 
when the families see their loved ones in the videos with guns pointed at their heads ,  they panic and want to pay whatever the taliban ask ,  the official said . 
he also said that publicly ,  the taliban demand release of their imprisoned militants  ,  but when contacting the abductees families ,  they seek money . 
according to his information ,  the taliban have kidnapped many journalists in different parts of the country but released them after obtaining a ransom . 
to minimise the risk of kidnappings and to shut off the flow of cash to the taliban ,  the afghan government has imposed stricter security rules for foreigners ,  including increased security around guest houses ,  and encouraging foreigners to be escorted . 
if anybody refuses to obey the rules and is kidnapped ,  the government will not allow their families to pay the kidnappers . 
the more you pay to the kidnappers ,  the more they are encouraged to kidnap even more people and thus they become stronger ,  the official added . 
often ,  when the taliban kidnap a foreigner and an afghan interpreter ,  driver or friend ,  they kill the afghan and send a video of his beheaded body to the foreigners family to terrify them into paying the ransom ,  said an afghan analyst who requested anonymity . 
they have been using very ugly tactics just to get as much money as they can ,  he said . 
they never respect anyones life ,  even those of their own muslim compatriots . 
they dont care about the misery of the murdered afghans children and the fact that families will suffer "  . 
some afghan refugees return home from pakistan
isa ,  eldest of five children ,  was born in peshawars suburban kababian village ,  where his father ran a small grocery shop . 
around <num>22,000</num>  afghan refugees have been repatriated since the process resumed march <num>22</num>  after the winter break ,  unhcr official qaisar khan afridi told central asia online . 
unhcrs voluntary repatriation programme is in its ninth year and is the uns largest return operation in the world . 
over <num>3.5</num>  meter  afghans have been repatriated from pakistan and <num>864,000</num>  from iran since <num>2002</num>  .
around <num>1.7</num>  meter  afghans are still in pakistan . 
the majority of these refugees are living in khyber pakhtunkhwa ,  mostly doing odd jobs or running small businesses . 
the government recently agreed to allow them to stay until <num>2012</num>  .
but since the situation has improved in most parts of afghanistan ,  many refugees have agreed to repatriation now . 
apart from peshawar ,  registration centres in quetta and elsewhere are working to ease the return of afghans to their homes . 
internally displaced families board a trailer in swabi to return to their home in the swat valley . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
for pakistanis ,  successful military operations in khyber pakhtunkhwa and the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  have allowed <num>90</num>  %  of the idps to return to their native towns . 
more than <num>2</num>  meter  refugees came down from the mountains to swabi ,  mardan ,  nowshera ,  charsadda ,  peshawar and other districts ,  where they found shelter either with the local villagers or in tent villages set up by unhcr . 
today ,  swats capital mingora is once again a bustling town ,  but the human cost of the conflict is still being felt there and across the swat valley ,  said a unhcr report released april <num>30</num>  .
unhcr and its ngo partners are helping some of the most vulnerable returnees by building shelters for civilians whose homes and other property has been lost . 
the group admitted that the displacement crisis in pakistan is not over . 
an idp camp in kacha pakka in kohat was attacked april <num>17</num>  .
more than <num>40</num>  people were killed and <num>100</num>  wounded ,  affecting the registration of idps . 
more than <num>130,000</num>  refugees live in nine camps in the southern districts of khyber pakhtunkhwa . 
not all idps can go home ,  though . 
our houses have been destroyed ,  and our schools and health centres bombed . 
he said he was still concerned about peace in his hometown ,  predicting it will take months for things to return to normal . 
not all afghan refugees want to go home ,  either . 
it will take several decades for afghanistan to return to normal life and provide the facilities to its people that we are enjoying in peshawar ,  said mohammad karim ,  an afghan refugee living in hayatabad township . 
karim runs a huge transport business and is not interested in putting my life at risk by returning to my hometown in kunduz . 
others have family obligations . 
i want to go back to my country ,  but none of my children is interested ,  said ihsanullah ,  a <num>56</num> -year-old resident of tehkal . 
two of his sons are working in germany ,  while others are running small businesses in peshawar and islamabad . 
they made it clear to me not to leave peshawar . 
prospect of peace talks heightens rifts among taliban ranks
afghan president hamid karzai speaks to a meeting with elders april <num>11</num>  in kunduz ,  afghanistan . 
karzai urged taliban insurgents to lay down their arms and air their grievances . 
kabul - some officials in the afghan capital are saying that offers of jobs ,  security ,  financial incentives and exile have heightened existing tensions in the afghan talibans ranks . 
the peace and reconciliation plan will offer those incentives to militants willing to denounce violence and accept the afghan constitution ,  said an official who has been part of the national advisory peace jirga ,  scheduled for the end of this month . 
many insurgent commanders and foot soldiers are tired of insurgency and are waiting to join the government . 
the hamid karzai government already has gained the consent of the international forces in this regard ,  the official told central asia online . 
tempting offers from the government are magnifying tensions among upper- and lower-level taliban leaders ,  the official added . 
even the supreme taliban leader ,  mullah omar ,  favours a peace deal ,  said a senior member of the afghan national council . 
speaking on condition of anonymity ,  the council member told central asia online that mullah omar was facing problems in his leadership and a lack of resources ,  making him willing to strike a deal . 
mullah omar has been quoted several times as saying he is willing to talk with the afghan government only after international forces leave the country . 
other taliban members reportedly are willing to negotiate before coalition forces leave ,  which may be one source of tension among taliban factions . 
mullah omar and his erstwhile military right-hand man ,  mullah baradar ,  might have differed on reconciliation . 
the pakistani arrest of mullah baradar in february made the point moot ,  but some counterinsurgency analysts theorised that mullah omar wanted a role for pakistan in any reconciliation with afghanistan . 
on the other hand ,  analysts said ,  mullah baradar had reached out to the un and the afghan government ,  bypassing pakistan . 
after police arrested mullah baradar ,  mullah akhtar mansoor ,  who served as civil aviation minister during taliban regime ,  expected to be named mullah omars deputy . 
but a formal decree from the quetta shura promoted mullah qayum zakir to that post and that of taliban defence minister . 
the promotion of zakir did not sit well with mullah mansoor ,  according to sources close to the taliban . 
pakistani intelligence reportedly arrested mansoor but released him after he accepted zakirs authority . 
however ,  tensions in the south still exist between the two mullahs ,  observers on the scene have said . 
they often compete for power by increasing forces from their own tribes ,  a tribal elder in helmand said . 
many counterinsurgency analysts say those two commanders are among the diehard taliban leaders unlikely to give up ,  since they have ties to al-qaeda . 
they also are closely allied to the haqqani and hafiz gul bahadur networks in north waziristan ,  but are despised by some other groups within the taliban and by some of the non-taliban insurgent groups ,  such as gulbuddin hekmatyars hizb-e-islami . 
the tension has not yet sparked intra-taliban fighting ,  informed sources told central asia online . 
but the sources reported combat between taliban and hizb-e-islami fighters in many places ,  the most important of which was a battle in northern baghlan province in march that took about <num>100</num>  lives from both sides . 
battles within the taliban for control of a zone or province are a serious matter ,  counterinsurgency experts say ,  because control of a province enables the victor to profit from the drug trade ,  kidnappings and donations from terrorist networks in foreign countries . 
whatever the reason for the rifts between militants ,  they serve the reconciliation plan ,  the anonymous official in kabul said ,  because they spur more insurgents to contact the government about laying down their arms .

analysts accuse militant groups of teaching a distorted version of islam and urge pakistan to deprogramme detained militants . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar - pakistan should try to deprogramme detained militants who have taken in too much terrorist indoctrination ,  analysts say . 
that conclusion emerged from a two-day  " strategic workshop on rehabilitation and de-radicalisation of militants and extremists "  in peshawar . 
foreign and local participants discussed how to rehabilitate extremists . 
the deprogramming analysts are forwarding recommendations to the government on how to fight  " misconstrued islam "  ,  khalid aziz ,  chairman of the workshop and leader of the fata capacity-building programme ,  told central asia online . 
he declined to detail the recommendations . 
 " ideology is like cancer "  ,  said mohamed faisal mohamed hassan from the international centre for political violence and terrorism research in singapore . 
rehabilitating militants means giving them  " a positive and real understanding of islamic concepts "  ,  he added . 
for years ,  the government frowned on the prospect of reintegration ;  now ,  things are changing . 
khyber pakhtunkhwa governor owais ahmed ghani ,  who represents the federal government ,  recited a telling aphorism :   " a war is not won until the defeated enemy is turned a friend "  . 
for years ,  scholars have pushed the idea of looking beyond the battlefield to defeat insurgency . 
 " you have to have a policy of rehabilitation for these people "  ,  khalid aziz said . 
the government became more receptive to such policy proposals when it experienced difficulty prosecuting captured militants . 
the chaos of war makes it difficult to gather enough evidence to satisfy judges . 
on may <num>19</num>  , for example ,  the peshawar high court ordered the release of four terror suspects - including suspected swat taliban commander maulana khalid - on bail after it found the evidence inadequate . 
 " it is difficult to convict these suspects ,  since the prosecution <abbr>…</abbr>  is weak "  ,  said a military officer who requested anonymity . 
workshop participants discussed how other countries rehabilitate their insurgents . 
afghanistan has won international plaudits for trying to reintegrate the taliban in an effort to isolate foreign ,  al-qaeda-linked elements . 
abusive prison conditions commonly found in asia play a role in radicalising captured militants ,  the scholars said . 
however ,  as supporters of rehabilitation acknowledge ,  the process requires years of dedication by everyone involved ,  and a commitment by society to take back former militants . 
pakistan to inaugurate bhasha dam project in july
one of the <num>50,000</num>  rock carvings from <num>1,000</num> -<num>10,000</num>  years old will be submerged by the diamer-bhasha dam project . 
the pakistani government will begin constructing the <num>12</num>  $  billion project in july to ease the countrys water and electricity shortages . 
the valley is on the world monument fund watch list of endangered monuments . 
 [ world monuments fund ] 
karachi - the pakistani government will begin construction of the us <num>12</num>  $  billion diamer-bhasha dam in july ,  tanvir malik ,  a spokesman for the ministry of water and power ,  told central asia online by phone from islamabad . 
federal minister for water and power raja pervez ashraf has given a july deadline to his ministry and the water and power development authority  ( wapda )  to complete the spadework <abbr>…</abbr>  for inaugurating construction work ,  malik said . 
the ministry has forwarded a summary to the council of common interests to develop a consensus among the provinces on the dam's construction
but while the project will generate electricity and provide drinking and irrigation water ,  it will also displace <num>32</num>  villages and some <num>30,000</num>  people . 
the world monument fund has listed the diamer-bhasha valley on its world monument watch list of threatened sites . 
the asian development bank  ( adb )  ,  a key financier ,  told the government it would announce details of its financing plan after the consensus emerges ,  malik said . 
engineers estimate the total cost at us <num>12.30</num>  $  billion ,  with the adb expected to contribute us <num>3</num>  $  billion to <num>5</num>  $  billion . 
the government and friends of democratic pakistan will split the rest of the cost ,  he said . 
in a few days ,  gilgit-baltistan chief minister syed mehdi shah will announce implementation of plans to prepare for the foundation-stone laying ceremony ,  he said . 
the government is seeking to signify a milestone in water sector development by launching construction with great fanfare in july ,  he said . 
he called the dam  " essential "  in fighting the country's worsening water and power crisis . 
after the government builds national consensus on the dam ,  project management will name the pre-qualified companies hired to build it ,  said dr izharul haq ,  project general manager . 
it will have storage capacity of <num>6.4</num>  meter  acre-feet and will generate 4 , 500mw of electricity daily ,  he said . 
the government wants to build the dam in six years instead of the scheduled ten ,  he added . 
a <num>35</num> -<num>40</num>  %  water shortage and daily shortfall of 5 , 000mw of electricity have given the government no option but to accelerate the dam's construction ,  dr ashfaq khan ,  former economic adviser to the finance ministry ,  told central asia online . 
the shortages are strangling economic growth ,  he warned . 
diamir-bhasha dam could prove to be not only an economic milestone but also a boost to the ruling party's image nationwide ,  he said . 
a number of reasons blocked pakistan from building new mega-reservoirs in the past <num>35</num>  years ,  he said . 
by <num>2010</num>  , water availability had dropped from <num>5,000</num>  cubic metres per capita per year in the early <num>1950</num>  second  to less than <num>1,500</num>  today ,  he said . 
pakistan could become water-scarce  ( having annual water availability below <num>1,000</num>  cubic metres per capita per year )  by <num>2035</num>  if it doesn't build new dams to meet future needs ,  khan added . 
foreign militants active in waziristan

the <num>22</num>  year old ,  wanted in germany on terrorism charges ,  joined the taliban and was killed april <num>28</num>  by pakistani security forces in south waziristan . 
peshawar -- abdul ghaffar al-almani ,  <num>22</num>  , was one of five foreign islamic militants killed during a clash with security forces in south waziristan april <num>28</num>  .
but something separated al-almani from his fellow foreign fighters :  uzbeks ,  tajiks ,  arabs and others . 
al-almani was born eric breininger in germany . 
the political agent of south waziristan ,  shahab ali shah ,  declined to comment . 
but mohammad amin ,  a tribal elder from south waziristan ,  confirmed the presence of a large number of germans and other militants of european origin . 
they are far more aggressive <abbr>…</abbr>  than the local militants ,  amin said . 
wazir tribesmen in south waziristan opposed the presence of foreigners ,  said mahmood wazir ,  a resident of azam warsak ,  and so conflict was inevitable . 
when the imu men gained power in waziristan and started to target even locals ,  the tribesmen along with local militants <abbr>…</abbr>  seized the uzbeks private jail in azam warsak in march <num>2007</num>  and killed many of the foreigners ,  mahmood said . 
combat raged for two days ,  and <num>52</num>  died . 
around <num>45</num>  of those killed were uzbeks ;  the rest were tribesmen . 
on april <num>2</num>  last year ,  a jirga of elders declared jihad against foreign militants <abbr>…</abbr>  and started to raise a tribal lashkar against them ,  said isa khan ,  a member of the yargul khel tribe . 
heavy fighting concentrated in the village of doza ghundai left more than <num>60</num>  people ,  including <num>50</num>  foreigners ,  killed . 
several uzbeks and foreigners surrendered to the lashkar . 
around ten tribal fighters and one pakistani soldier were also killed . 
some accounts ,  though ,  paint a portrait of foreign fighters becoming both entrenched and comfortable in the tribal areas . 
the german federal office of criminal investigation  ( bka )  has a list of about <num>100</num>  citizens who left for afghanistan and pakistan or attempted to join militants ,  according to news reports . 
the list includes former berlin resident michael w ,  his eritrean wife and her minor daughter . 
also on the list is a <num>19</num> -year-old berliner ,  omar h ,  who disappeared with his girlfriend in january <num>2009</num>  .
the trend of bringing wives and children to waziristan is something new ,  said amin ,  who tracks developments in his area . 
adam ,  whose real name is mounir chouka ,  received weapons training in the german army <abbr>…</abbr>  and later spent three years training at the federal office of statistics . 
he left his country in <num>2007</num>  , a source told central asia online . 
a german-libyan brother-in-law of abu adam ,  ahmed k ,  was also among the fighters in the german village in waziristan . 
in a number of videos posted on youtube ,  abu adam and abu ibrahim urge viewers to take up arms for islam . 
militants belonging to different western countries have been killed and apprehended here . 
among the foreigners are not only germans but a large number of uzbeks ;  tajiks ;  arabs from egypt ,  saudi arabia ,  uae ,  yemen and palestine ;  and chechens and some from sweden ,  turkey ,  canada and other european countries ,  sources in the political administration confirmed to central asia online . 
the high-profile foreigners who were killed during security operations in the tribal areas include imu commander tahir yuldashev .

 [ thomas coex / afp / getty images ] 
kabul - a twice-delayed peace jirga is scheduled to start june <num>2</num>  , but public reaction has been largely indifferent . 
officials in the afghan capital have completed all the arrangements ,  including security ,  for the afghanistan national consultative peace jirga . 
but despite expectations for the jirga to be well attended ,  most of the afghans interviewed by central asia online doubted whether it would change anything . 
about <num>1,600</num>  afghans representing different institutions and regions of the country ,  and <num>300</num>  guests ,  will participate in the jirga ,  gul agha ahmadi ,  spokesman of the government-led council ,  told central asia online . 
initially ,  observers expected that some insurgent elements would receive invitations to the jirga . 
presidential spokesman waheed omar however ruled out this possibility ,  saying at an early-may news conference that the government had not invited any insurgent groups but would welcome any group seeking to participate . 
some observers questioned the value of a jirga lacking those whom the government most wants to pacify . 
the taliban ,  hizb-e-islami and dr abdullah abdullah -- president hamid karzais foe in the last election - all have ruled out participating . 
all of the  ( participants )  are either part of the government or support the government ,  said mohammad jan ,  a kabul university graduate . 
there are only two ways to change the situation in afghanistan :  if the government is strong <abbr>…</abbr>  enough to establish its authority in the provinces and deal with the insurgents or if the international community forces <abbr>…</abbr>  other regional powers to stop supporting terrorism . 
the government should do something against corruption and also should improve its governance in the provinces ,  he said . 
even before the london conference on afghanistan this january ,  the afghan government had been developing a mechanism to reconcile with the top leadership of the taliban and reintegrate militant foot soldiers into afghan society . 
a delegation of gulbuddin hekmatyars hizb-e-islami later met with afghan officials in kabul ,  and a similar meeting recently took place in the maldives . 
but observers see no significant progress toward reconciliation . 
president karzai wants to show the world that he is making efforts for peace in the country "  ,  said saifullah ahmadzai ,  a kabul-based research analyst who works on the informal government system in afghanistan . 
 " but it is not possible to bring peace by gathering government officials in kabul for three days "  . 
pakistani army declares victory in orakzai

the pakistani military has claimed victory against militants in orakzai agency . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar - after months of air bombardment and ground attacks earlier this year ,  the pakistani army has claimed victory over the taliban in the strategic orakzai tribal region bordering the khyber and kurram tribal areas . 
the coas  ( chief of army staff )  visit to orakzai agency marks the successful conclusion of operations in the agency ,  a brief statement from inter services public relations read . 
control of orakzai gave the taliban strategic depth ,  extending its influence to peshawar and islamabad and helping disrupt the flow of goods and fuel to coalition forces in afghanistan through the khyber pass . 
he appreciated the professional conduct of the operation which has cleared the agency of terrorists ,  the statement quoted kayani as saying to the troops and tribal elders . 
the announcement of victory in orakzai comes days after the military took back militant strongholds in swat ,  bajaur and south waziristans mehsud areas . 
pakistans coalition partners in the war against militancy have particularly hailed improvement in the swat situation . 
military spokesman maj-gen athar abbas said search operations would follow and that he hopes troops will quickly comb populated areas to ensure that militants are not hiding among civilians . 
we are on right track as far as the orakzai operation is concerned ,  he told central asia online by phone from islamabad . 
tribal areas former security chief brig  ( retd )  mehmood shah described the insurgents loss of ground in orakzai as a major achievement for the countrys war on militancy . 
this victory has put the militants back on their heels ,  he told central asia online . 
the operation displaced thousands of civilians ,  who are staying in government-run relief camps . 
their return will be a major task for the authorities . 
more than <num>70,000</num>  families fled the orakzai and kurram tribal districts to avoid being caught in the crossfire . 
military control of orakzai will ease the pressure on populated districts of hangu ,  kohat and peshawar and the khyber tribal region ,  where growing militant influence nearby has degraded security .

peshawar -- militancy is taking a psychological toll on the dwellers of violence-wracked malakand and the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  . 
psychiatrist mian iftikhar hussain at the sarhad hospital for psychiatric diseases  ( shpd )  attributes psychiatric problems in militancy-wracked areas to fear ,  stress ,  coping with the murders of family and friends ,  and seeing mutilated bodies after terrorist attacks . 
last year ,  the shpd recorded about <num>97,000</num>  psychiatric cases from fata ,  swat ,  tank ,  hangu ,  darra adamkhel and other areas hit by violence . 
this year so far ,  the number is about <num>22,000</num>  , including women and children who suffer from severe post-traumatic stress disorder  ( ptsd )  ,  he said . 
the taliban killed my only son because he belonged to the awami national party . 
he is in paradise and is inviting me every night because he feels lonely without me ,  the <num>55</num> -year-old housewife told her doctor . 
last month ,  the world health organisation  ( who )  called for immediate measures to address the psychological problems as internally displaced persons  ( idps )  are repatriated . 
a report released by the global health agency said most of the idps suffered from various forms of mental distress . 
mentally disabled children ,  who lack the specialised care that can prevent problems from snowballing into major health concerns ,  are most vulnerable . 
but women and children in general are a concern ,  the report found . 
about <num>4</num>  %  of the population suffer from severe psychiatric disorders  ,  the who said ,  but a much larger portion of the population suffers from transient mental health problems linked to the stress of living under conditions of conflict and violence . 
the who has recommended management of urgent psychiatric conditions at the primary health care level ,  including referral to psychiatric hospitals and continued treatment of chronic psychiatric patients . 
victims of severe mental traumas due to the conflict and subsequent displacement should receive psychological support ,  it suggested . 
i had several orchards destroyed by militants . 
he said the taliban turned him from an aid contributor into an aid recipient . 
now the farmer needs psychological support to restore his confidence ,  shafiq said . 
the provincial health department in its post-conflict rapid assessment in swat revealed that <num>27</num>  of the valleys <num>228</num>  health facilities were destroyed ,  while <num>54</num>  suffered partial damage that will cost an estimated rs <num>1.2</num>  billion  ( us <num>1.2</num>  )  to fix . 
this has put the population in a precarious situation because it needed urgent treatment … particularly for mental ailments ,  the assessment said . 
just peace international  ( jpi )  ,  an ngo that ran a project with the financial assistance of the greek-based charity european union perspective ,  said about <num>85</num>  %  of the displaced population living with host communities had experienced problems ,  since they lost their social identities when they had to leave their homes . 
we have so far seen <num>255</num>  patients ,  including <num>177</num>  women . 
anxiety and mistrust are common among conflict-zone residents ,  bashir said . 
every third person in south and north waziristan ,  bajaur and swat suffers from depression and many women and children complain of recurring nightmares of blood-splattered bodies and homeless families living in destitution ,  he said . 
a <num>12</num> -year-old girl brought to the psychiatry ward was suffering from anxiety and fear ,  dr jawad ali ,  a psychiatrist at the khyber teaching hospital peshawar said . 
she had witnessed a suicide bomb blast . 
the problem is most of the patients face relapses ,  ali said . 
victims of violence need regular psychological services ,  counselling and treatment to help them overcome the trauma . 
the doctors cannot reach everyone ,  though ,  and part of that is societys fault . 
people do not consider  ( mental )  trauma a health concern ,  ali said . 
also ,  patients have shunned the jpi clinic in batkhela out of fear of militants ,  bashir said ,  explaining jpi was planning to establish free psychiatric clinics in other conflict zones . 
but we plan to have workshops in the violence-prone areas when law and order improves ,  he said . 
now ,  people aren't consulting psychiatrists because of the social stigma . 
so  ( better )  public awareness is needed "  . 
karachi -- cyclone phet lashed karachi june <num>5</num>  , and heavy rains paralysed life in coastal areas and adjoining cities in sindh and balochistan provinces as well as damaging infrastructure before moving on sunday . 
the cyclone did not directly cause any deaths ,  since authorities evacuated coastal areas in time ,  but winds and rains caused <num>12</num>  casualties in karachi ,  hyderabad and ghotki . 
in karachi ,  the storm caused eight deaths ,  including seven from electrocution ,  mostly when the victims waded into water where live electrical lines had fallen . 
we will co-ordinate with the district authorities and ngos to rehabilitate the  ( affected )  people . 
the sindh government relocated some <num>40,000</num>  residents from coastal areas to relief camps ;  as a result ,  the inhabitants of coastal belts remained safe ,  he said . 
balochistan authorities evacuated more than <num>4,000</num>  people from gwadar and pasni . 
the heavy rains ravaged roads ,  the electricity network and buildings . 
in gwadar they badly damaged <num>10,000</num>  homes . 
flash floods submerged the <num>250</num> -mile coastal highway from ormara to jiwani and washed parts of it away . 
tidal waves swept away hundreds of fishing boats from lasbela to jiwani ,  news media reported . 
with the storm now gone ,  the provincial and federal governments are turning their attention to rebuilding . 
the sindh government has directed district administrators in cyclone- and rain-affected areas to prepare damage reports so that the government can compensate those affected . 
efforts are under way to restore the damaged infrastructure . 
taliban in khyber pakhtunkhwa kill <num>2,199</num>  since <num>2007</num> 
a policeman guards a highway linking mingora with kanju in swat after government forces took back control of the district from the taliban militants last year . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar -- the taliban-linked militancy in khyber pakhtunkhwa killed <num>1,518</num>  civilians and <num>681</num>  police personnel from january <num>2007</num>  through march <num>2010</num>  , according to official figures obtained by central asia online . 
the provincial government also said <num>334</num>  militants were killed and <num>2,885</num>  were arrested since the start of <num>2008</num>  .
militant deaths and arrests for <num>2007</num>  were not provided . 
the figures provided to central asia online show that <num>742</num>  civilians and <num>278</num>  law enforcement personnel were killed in <num>2009</num>  , making it the bloodiest year in the last three-and-a-half years . 
the deaths were attributed to suicide bombings ,  improvised explosive devices  ( ieds )  ,  and other taliban attacks . 
according to the official figures ,  civilian casualties almost doubled last year in comparison to <num>2008</num>  .
in <num>2008</num>  , <num>409</num>  people ,  including men ,  women and children ,  perished in attacks throughout the province . 
the government did not provide casualty numbers by district . 
however ,  the swat district in malakand has suffered more than any other district under taliban control . 
the governments military offensive has since expelled the militants . 
during the past three and a half years ,  the taliban carried out <num>112</num>  suicide attacks ,  <num>632</num>  eid attacks and waged <num>920</num>  gun battles ,  missile and hand-grenade attacks . 
in <num>2009</num>  , there were <num>47</num>  suicide attacks ,  <num>210</num>  ied attacks and <num>470</num>  other attacks on police and other law enforcement agencies and civilians . 
militant attacks have dropped significantly in the first six months of <num>2010</num>  , with only seven suicide attacks ,  <num>16</num>  ied bombings and <num>31</num>  other attacks ,  according to the official figures . 
these attacks have killed <num>114</num>  civilians ,  <num>14</num>  police and <num>39</num>  other law enforcement personnel . 
the decrease in the number of attacks is linked to the destruction of militant command-and-control structures during military operations in swat and other districts of the malakand region ,  bajaur ,  orakzai and south waziristan ,  experts say . 
because of the provinces deteriorating security situation ,  the khyber pakhtunkhwa government increased the police budget for fiscal year <num>2010</num> -<num>2011</num>  by <num>117</num>  %  to a record rs <num>21</num>  billion  ( us <num>21</num>  )  . 
finance minister muhammad humayun khan told the provincial assembly last week that the increased police budget would help increase strengthen the police by building more police stations and equipping officers with the latest weapons and communication systems to take on the militancy more effectively . 
the prevailing law and order situation has increased expenditure manifolds . 
the province ,  despite having limited resources ,  has allocated adequate funds to police services . 
in the said backdrop ,  there is a sharp increase in the budget of police ,  humayun said . 
last year ,  the police budget was less than rs <num>10</num>  billion  ( us <num>10</num>  )  . 
pakistan evacuates citizens from kyrgyzstan
pakistani citizens evacuated from kyrgyzstan arrive at chaklala military airbase in rawalpindi june <num>15</num>  .
pakistan flew home more than <num>130</num>  citizens from kyrgyzstan . 
 [ aamir qureshi / afp / getty images ] 
peshawar - the worried parents of asif sohrab were visibly excited when their son arrived at chaklala airbase ,  rawalpindi in the wee hours of june <num>15</num>  .
life had become impossible in kyrgyzstan . 
he said the two buses that took the students to the airport were escorted by tanks . 
asif and the other students praised pakistani officials in kyrgyzstan ,  the foreign ministry and media for providing immediate help to the stranded students . 
the student said a senior official arranged for the students to travel to the airport amid strict security . 
a second c-130 with pakistani students and businessmen arrived at chaklala around <num>4</num>  : 40pm . 
the passengers included <num>92</num>  students ,  their family members and pakistani businessmen working in kyrgyzstan . 
pakistani foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi said most pakistanis stranded in kyrgyzstan have safely returned home . 
if any pakistani is still in kyrgyzstan ,  he should contact our embassy ,  qureshi said . 
as many as <num>269</num>  pakistanis studying medicine and engineering across kyrgyzstan were stranded when inter-ethnic rioting began in the countrys south june <num>11</num>  .
ali raza of shorkot ,  who was studying electrical engineering in osh and living with uzbek friends ,  was shot to death sunday . 
his body was on the first aircraft that also brought some <num>20</num>  female students and two children back to pakistan . 
ali was studying electrical engineering in kyrgyzstan ,  said ayman ,  razas younger sister . 
the family had huge expectations from ali but he left us alone . 
pakistans information minister qamar zaman kaira and other officials received the students at the airport . 
the foreign office ,  ndma and pakistani embassy in kyrgyzstan did a great job in bringing these students back ,  kaira said . 
many students burst into tears as they hugged parents and siblings who had awaited their arrival for hours . 
aside from the joy of arriving home safely ,  many students were worried about their academic future . 
thank god ,  thank god ,  thank god that we are back in our country safe and sound . 
the first thing we want to do is to complete our education and get our degrees as soon as peace returns to kyrgyzstan ,  said one female student . 
students said the situation was deteriorating with each passing day ,  and that makes getting the rest of the pakistani students home more important . 
pakistani foreign direct investment declines by <num>44</num>  % 
pakistani police take positions outside one of the two ahmadi worship places in lahore stormed by gunmen may <num>28</num>  , killing dozens . 
pakistans security situation has discouraged foreign direct investment . 
 [ arif ali / afp / getty images ] 
no one comes to invest in a country like pakistan confronted with a debt trap and a growing fiscal deficit ,  prime minister economic advisory committee  ( eac )  and former advisor to the finance ministry dr ashfaq hasan khan said . 
if you look at developments of the past two years ,  in pakistans case its debt has gone up to <num>60</num>  %  of gdp and  ( it has a )  growing fiscal deficit . 
pakistans foreign direct investment  ( fdi )  dropped by <num>44.7</num>  %  in the first ten months of fiscal year <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  , compared with a year earlier ,  according to an official document of the board of investment  ( boi )  ,  a division responsible for promoting investment in pakistan . 
the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  has released fdi for july-april  ( <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  )  indicating <num>1.772</num>  $  billion against <num>3.20</num>  $  billion for the corresponding period of the last fiscal year ,  the document says . 
the document indicates that pakistan secured <num>3.52</num>  $  billion in fdi in <num>2005</num> -<num>2006</num>  .
fdi grew to <num>5.14</num>  $  billion in <num>2006</num> -<num>2007</num>  , then <num>5.41</num>  $  billion in <num>2007</num> -<num>2008</num>  .
however ,  with the decline in economic growth and the prevalence of terrorism ,  its fdi level dropped to <num>3.72</num>  $  billion in <num>2008</num> -<num>2009</num>  .
as terror attacks intensified ,  investment continued to shrink ,  dropping to <num>1.72</num>  $  billion in <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  .
the united states was the top investor with <num>2010</num>  . . 
the oil and gas sector attracted the most investment ,  <num>2010</num>  . . 
other industries receiving significant foreign support include telecommunications ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  finance ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  transportation ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  paper and pulp ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  construction ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  chemicals ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  and others ,  <num>2010</num>  . . 
the rise in suicide attacks and a counter-terror operations in pakistan led to a flight of capital that peaked in <num>2009</num>  .
at international forums seeking fdi ,  pakistani officials had no answer to investors who asked why they should invest in pakistan when pakistanis were investing abroad . 
the situation wont improve until the government remedies the security and energy crises ,  said dr abid suleri ,  executive director of the sustainable development policy institute . 
its hard to lure investment unless and until investors are given lucrative incentives for preferring pakistan over other countries ,  suleri said . 
suleri does not agree with government officials that law and order will improve drastically in coming years ,  helping pakistan to secure fdi . 
i dont see any major development in coming years as far as fdi in pakistan is concerned ,  as there is no considerable change in law and order andthe energy sector expected in the near future ,  he said . 
afghan mineral discoveries could transform national economy
kabul - afghanistans mineral deposits may be worth more than us <num>3</num>  $  trillion ,  according to the governments mining ministry - a figure that is triple previous estimates and that has generated hope for afghanistans economic future . 
the preliminary information that we have is about a big vein of iron ,  which starts from badakhshan province and goes to the border with iran ,  afghan mining minister waheedullah shahrani said at a june <num>17</num>  press conference . 
recent research has discovered huge veins of copper ,  iron ,  cobalt ,  gold and strategic metals like lithium . 
the government will prioritize iron and copper mining and hopes to include income from those deposits in its budget within five to seven years ,  afghan officials said . 
mining officials have voiced optimistic predictions that the newly discovered mineral wealth will transform some of the countrys poorest areas into its wealthiest . 
the mining ministry announced it has established an information centre to help prospective investors track progress on mining permits ,  deposit discoveries and other matters . 
the ministry has invited international firms to invest in mining and has predicted heavy investment to result from a conference scheduled for this week in london . 
afghanistan has nearly two billion tonnes of iron ,  shahrani estimated . 
hajigak mine ,  the biggest iron mine in the world ,  will be introduced to around <num>200</num>  investors ,  he said . 
we will provide them with all preliminary geological information . 
afghan president hamid karzai ,  who is travelling to japan ,  has courted mining investment worldwide but said that afghanistan would prefer investment from countries that have supported it in the past . 
but afghan officials said they need help taking the next step . 
ensuring security and having modern equipment ,  as well as effective consultation and training of afghan experts ,  are the needs of the hour ,  jawad omar ,  a mining ministry spokesman ,  told central asia online . 
kabul will ask the international community to help afghanistan mine those deposits ,  said aziz shams ,  a finance ministry spokesman . 
scholars said mining could invigorate the countrys feeble job market . 
serious problems stand in the way of longed-for prosperity ,  though . 
illegal mining ,  poor security and administration ,  and a lack of trained geologists will challenge the mining industry . 
just last year ,  then-mining minister mohammad ibrahim adel was accused of taking a us <num>200</num>  bribe to award china the rights to develop afghanistans copper mine . 
adel lost his job . 
as uzbek elections approach ,  will there be any choices ? 
tashkent - as uzbekistan prepares to go to the polls december <num>27</num>  to elect a new parliament ,  some voters seem resigned ,  others supportive ,  while opposition figures and human rights advocates say the elections will be neither free nor fair . 
uzbekistan has a bicameral parliament ,  with <num>100</num>  seats in the senate and <num>150</num>  in the lower chamber . 
the <num>2003</num>  law on elections to the oliy majlis was amended in december <num>2008</num>  , increasing the number of seats in the lower chamber from <num>120</num>  to <num>150</num>  , and reserving <num>15</num>  seats for the recently-established ecological movement of uzbekistan . 
all other members of parliament are elected in single- mandate constituencies . 
elections for local and regional offices will also be held december <num>27</num>  .
according to the uzbek central election commission website ,  a total of <num>517</num>  candidates are running for office ,  including <num>123</num>  from the adolat social democratic party of uzbekistan ,  <num>125</num>  from milliy tiklanish democratic party of uzbekistan ,  <num>135</num>  from liberal democratic party of uzbekistan and <num>134</num>  from the peoples democratic party . 
those four parties all currently have seats in parliament ,  with a <num>40</num> -seat majority held by the liberal democrats ,  the party of president islam karimov . 
in order to earn a place on the ballot ,  a candidate belonging to a registered party must collect a minimum of <num>40,000</num>  signatures . 
however ,  several opposition politicians have said that all candidates must be approved by the government before they will be placed on the ballot . 
a central election commission spokesman refused to answer a reporters questions about the elections and candidate registration . 
veronica szente goldston ,  human rights watch advocacy director for europe and central asia ,  said the pre-election situation in uzbekistan has been marked by intense repression by the government : 
szente goldston also faulted the uzbek government for restricting speech and campaigning ahead of the elections . 
there is no independent reporting . 
absolutely all the critical media is either out of the country or imprisoned . 
there are no real debates on the election campaign in the media ,  she said . 
transcripts from these shows are reprinted in the countrys newspapers . 
in addition ,  there are billboards touting the upcoming choice uzbeks have to make . 
but how much of a choice do uzbeks have ? 
 ( they )  announce the same election platform every year ,  saying they support the internal and foreign policy of the government . 
nobody speaks about corruption ,  bureaucracy ,  poverty ,   ( or )  freedom ,  said an uzbek political analyst who asked not to be named . 
yet ,  despite the limited choices ,  iskhakov said people will still go vote . 
its in the mentality of our people that they go and vote ,  even if they dont know who the candidate is . 
uzbekistan still has the practice where one family member takes the passports of the others and votes for all of them at the polling station ,  she said . 
others ,  it seems may not have a choice but to go vote . 
what will or will not happen at the polls december <num>27</num>  , however ,  is hard to gauge . 
international organizations that observe elections are not monitoring the polls ,  and foreign media find it difficult to officially report on the elections . 
a number of candidates and officials contacted by central asia online refused to discuss their campaigns ,  while a number of private citizens refused to speak to a reporter when they were asked about the upcoming elections . 
the organization for security and cooperation in europe  ( osce )  has opened an assessment mission to review whether recommendations made in past years have been adopted by the uzbek government . 
the osce assessment mission will observe voting at several polling places ,  but will not do comprehensive vote monitoring . 
but all politics is local ,  and some uzbeks still express support for the process and their incumbent member of parliament . 
cis leaders meet to discuss security ,  regional cooperation
almaty -- a two-day informal summit of heads of state for the commonwealth of the independent states  ( cis )  was held at the ak-bulak ski resort ,  <num>40</num>  km from almaty ,  december <num>19</num> -<num>20</num>  .
the seven leaders exchanged views on economic ,  humanitarian and political security in the region ahead of the 10t anniversary of the eurasian economic community  ( eurasec )  and kazakhstans chairmanship of both eurasec and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe  ( osce )  in <num>2010</num>  , reported central asia onlines almaty correspondent . 
the spokesman said there was no set agenda for the meeting . 
russian news agency ria novosti reported that the presidents met to synchronize watches before launching a three-nation customs union among belarus ,  russia ,  and kazakhstan january <num>1</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
kyrgyzstan has also expressed interest in joining the union . 
according to other press reports ,  the discussion included regional cooperation ,  combating drug trafficking from afghanistan ,  and the outlook for cooperation among regional and international organizations . 
we have gathered here to exchange opinions on questions of joint interest ,  and to discuss once again our future plans and activities . 
holding informal meetings became a good tradition of ours . 
i am sure we must continue this practice ,  because it lets us discuss a wide range of questions of concern for all of us ,  kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said at the opening of the summit . 
russias first deputy prime minister igor shuvalov - who accompanied russian president dmitry medvedev to the summit - told russian state tv afterward that russia approves and supports the commissioning of the turkmenistan-uzbekistan-kazakhstan-china gas pipeline this week . 
the more diverse and the better the infrastructure in the customs union and cis countries ,  the bigger our contribution to global energy security ,  he said december <num>19</num>  .
we support such projects ,  russia on its own ,  and in cooperation with other partners is working to expand the infrastructure for energy supplies . 
this is the first time when a member country of the collective security treaty organization  ( csto )  becomes the osce chairman . 
kazakhstan will also represent our interests ,  sargsyan said . 
he stressed that armenia and kazakhstan are allies . 
it is jihad  ( holy war )  ,  the boy ,  about <num>12</num>  , replied when the teacher asked him what this pillar is . 
no son ,  there are only five pillars of islam and jihad is obligatory when the state declares it ,  and not groups or individuals ,  farooq said ,  trying to teach true islam . 
central asia online was given rare access to the heavily-guarded sabawoon - meaning new dawn in pashtu - a school at rangmala . 
interviews with the taliban kids were not allowed for security and educational reasons . 
the students are <num>13</num>  to <num>18</num>  years old and few have finished secondary school . 
the <num>14</num> -month project is the first of its kind in pakistan ,  where islamic militancy has spread to every corner of the country . 
militants seek children <num>12</num>  to <num>16</num>  , believing them to be effective for suicide bombings and other attacks . 
for example ,  khair hussain ,  <num>16</num>  , was arrested last month in mingora ,  a suburb in the swat district . 
hussain told police the taliban forced him to carry out a suicide attack . 
i was not mentally prepared to do it but the taliban were forcing me all the time to blow myself up amid crowds or close to soldiers or military installations ,  said
at sabawoon ,  school management separates children into two groups :  low- and high-risk . 
high security measures are in place out of fear students could run away or be taken by the taliban . 
among the high-risk children are five who were trained for suicide bombings . 
psychiatrists at the school believe it will take years to undo that training . 
these kids were suspicious of everything ,  farooq said . 
they found the environment very hostile . 
they thought they were in prison . 
farooq said the taliban told the kids that pakistan is a liberal and infidel country ,  and that there was every justification to fight the infidels as it said in shariah . 
aamir said taliban strategists also use the children for spying and logistical support . 
it was difficult to suspect a kid of this early age to be spying on you . 
but they were used as informants ,  giving information on  ( the )  movement or position of army or paramilitary troops to the taliban commanders in their respective areas ,  he said . 
hum pakistani foundation ,  a lahore-based ngo partnering with the army and unicef on the project ,  believes many other children are at risk of being used by the taliban . 
there is a whole section of youth in swat that is vulnerable ,  a psychiatrist who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal told central asia online . 
the psychiatrist said more such facilities are needed for the thousands of kids vulnerable to taliban influence . 
while visiting low-risk kids during their religious education class ,  signs of early recovery emerge . 
it is the state and not groups or individuals to declare jihad ,  they answered . 
the school does not allow the students to leave the premises ,  but parents can visit their children once after two weeks . 
he said the taliban kidnapped his son on his way home from school early this year . 
but not every child was used for suicide bombing . 
the taliban has destroyed around <num>500</num>  schools ,  mostly for girls ,  in swat and other areas in the north west frontier province and federal administered tribal areas along the border with afghanistan . 
in swat alone ,  <num>401</num>  schools were destroyed to keep the youth as vulnerable as possible and the hum pakistani foundation psychiatrist warns of dangers to peace if these vulnerable kids have no other options . 
shanghai cooperation organisation members to discuss russia -georgia conflict ? 
bolat nurgaliev ,  general secretary of the shanghai cooperation organisation
<num>28</num>  in the tajikistans capital of dushanbe to take part in the summit of the shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  ,  which consists of six countries ,  kazakhstan ,  china ,  kyrgyzstan ,  russia ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan <abbr>…</abbr> 
the summit agenda was ironed out during a july <num>25</num>  meeting of foreign ministers of member nations . 
nine separate issues were addressed and agreed on over the course of the meeting . 
taking centre stage during the summit will be the dushanbe declaration ,  a document that will reflect the views of the organisations position and role in the contemporary world of international politics and central asia in particular . 
special attention will be given to the problems of afghanistan ,  and the threats emanating from that country in the form of drugs trafficking and terrorism . 
also included in the summit agenda will be discussions of international outreach and sco expansion ,  as well as evaluating areas of practical interest for further cooperation with observer nations . 
at the same time ,  russian military operations against georgia will provide a backdrop for discussions during the dushanbe summit . 
the stronger russian army continues to maintain troops on georgian territory under the pretext of a peacekeeping mission in the two unrecognised enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia . 
its quite possible that certain appraisals of russias conflict with georgia will be aired during the dushanbe summit ,  but only in smoke-filled back rooms ,  dinara bisembina ,  correspondent for kazakh newspaper liter ,  believes . 
but ,  russias participation in the conflict makes the issue a relevant topic ,  despite the fact that the caucuses region does not fall under the scope of the sco . 
thats why the russian-georgian military conflict will certainly prompt some backroom discussions ,  bisembina said . 
in making this statement ,  the kazakh diplomat was making it clear that no official statements on the conflict would be forthcoming from the sco . 
bisembina believes that china will resist any discussion of the georgian situation during the summit ,  since the country is not interested in polarising the organisation with anti-american sentiments . 
this would be a way to avoid offending those countries actively lobbying to be allowed into the organisation ,  such as iran ,  india and pakistan ,  who the sco does not plan to put on equal footing with observer nations such as mongolia and turkmenistan . 
kazakhstan has consistently maintained a cautious position on the issue of sco expansion . 
while its believed that russia is interested in allowing iran into the shanghai six ,  kazakhstan-the only central asian nation with broad bilateral ties with the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> -does not view the sco as a counter to nato . 
instead ,  kazakhstan sees the organisation as a way to maintain parity in russian and chinese influence in central asia . 
kyrgyzstan to raise heating and electricity rates
a kyrgyz official inspects the site in the naryn river bed for the new kambarata-2 hydroelectric dam ,  <num>320</num>  km outside bishkek ,  earlier this month . 
the new plant will help upgrade the countrys energy system and is part of an energy-independence plan . 
with the nations energy system worn out and suffering high losses ,  prime minister daniyar usenov has announced that kyrgyz heating and electricity rates will increase january <num>1</num>  .
that has people worried about how theyll pay to stay warm this winter . 
the cost of <num>1</num>  kwh will increase to <num>1.5</num>  som  ( us$0 . 04 )  from <num>0.71</num>  som  ( us$0 . 02 )  . 
on july <num>1</num>  , the second stage of the rate increase will begin ,  with one gigacalorie costing <num>2,500</num>  soms ,  instead of the current <num>500</num>  .
epuryanu said her pension is <num>3,000</num>  soms per month . 
she calculates that she is going to pay twice as much for heating her apartment ,  which uses one gigacalorie per month . 
the same goes for electricity . 
that means that if ,  in january ,  i pay <num>300</num>  soms for electricity and <num>1,000</num>  soms for heat ,  then all that will remain is half of my pension . 
but cholponbek kadyrov ,  head of the kyrgyz branch of the moscow power engineering institute ,  said the impact will not be as bad as some fear . 
president bakiyev issued a decree to give aid to those who will not be able to pay their bills on their own . 
ninety-five percent of pensioners fall into the category of these beneficiaries ,  kadyrov said . 
but opposition leader and head of the ak shumkar party ,  timir sariyev ,  doubts the additional revenue will go to the energy sector . 
money collected from the increased billing rates going to the needs of the republics energy sector is not something that we are able to speak clearly of so long as there is no truly transparent system of governance in the energy sector ,  he told central asia online . 
he said rather than rate increases ,  the government should reduce energy transmission losses and the theft of electricity . 
presently ,  our overall energy loss is up to <num>40</num>  percent . 
but ,  few people are stealing ;  generally the theft comes from the highest circles :  the management of the energy companies ,  sariyev said . 
both the political opposition and the non-governmental sector have proposed a delay in the rate increases . 
toktaiym umetalieva ,  chairwoman of the kyrgzstan association for nongovernmental and not-for-profit organisations ,  said there has been no technical justification for raising the rates ,  and no explanation as to how exactly the new rates were developed . 
sources in the government analytical department told central asia online the money will be used for repairs ,  and the first results of the increase in rates will be seen within the year . 
the repairs will begin on substations and transformers ,  and part of the sum will be devoted to the construction of large energy facilities ,  said one government analyst . 
first deputy prime minister of economic affairs akylbek japarov ,  one of the developers of the new energy rates told central asia online the public needs to accept the new rates and find ways to pay for energy . 
every inhabitant of the country is wasting about <num>1,000</num>  soms on their cell phone every month . 
by the way ,  the idea of prepayment ,  which is used with cell phones ,  we will transfer to energy relations . 
in southern kyrgyzstan ,  which faces the most dire energy shortages ,  markhaba saileyeva ,  a housewife and mother of six ,  said she has started watching kyrgyz news for the first time in recent years . 
as soon as we heard that we are going to pay more for electricity ,  we turned on the bishkek station . 
to tell the truth ,  many people are talking about this increase ,  but we still cannot get how much we are going to pay after the new year ,  she said . 
saileyeva said her husband is a baker ,  who will have to increase the price of bread to pay the new energy rates . 
but umetalieva said the baker is not the only who will be raising prices ,  and expects prices on food and other products will increase along with energy prices . 
the prime minister says that goods will go up 5percent in cost . 
the price of food and all other products ,  all of which need electricity to be produced ,  are growing . 
they never should have rushed to this increase . 
tajikistan :  country prepares for parliamentary elections
the tajikistan elections in <num>2006</num>  drew a crowd as the presidency was up for vote . 
some of the policies around the elections ,  though ,  come under question each year . 
 [ maxim marmur / afp / getty images ] 
but most say they expect few electoral surprises with respect to who will win ,  how people will vote ,  or how the media will cover the run-up to the elections . 
voters will go to the polls february <num>28</num>  to elect members of tajikistans lower house of parliament ,  the majlisi namoyandagon ,  the upper house or majilisi milli ,  and local elected offices . 
independent experts suggest that the balance of power in the new parliament is unlikely to change ,  with most seats again going to the pro-presidential peoples democratic party of tajikistan  ( ndpt )  . 
voters also do not expect much difference in how voting will be conducted on election day . 
dushanbe resident sabagul najmiddinova ,  <num>60</num>  , said she doesnt plan to vote . 
in past elections ,  as the head of our apartment building ,  i was forced to vote for the tenants who did not go to the polling station ,  najmiddinova told central asia online . 
my husband voted on behalf of my son ,  who is with his family working in russia . 
why should we go vote if they are going to do your voting for you ? 
kobil yatimov ,  who has been a migrant worker for more than <num>10</num>  years ,  said he hasnt voted once in parliamentary or presidential elections ,  but that his relatives voted for him . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  as far as i know ,  each voter should only vote for himself ,  he said . 
tajikistan has some <num>3.4</num>  million eligible voters ,  of which <num>533,000</num>  , or <num>15</num>  percent ,  are migrant workers outside the country . 
in places with the largest concentrations of migrants in russian cities and kazakhstan ,  polling stations will be opened on election day ,  said mukhibullo dodojanov ,  chief of staff of the central commission for elections and national referendums  ( tsik )  .   . 
dodojanov said members of local election commissions will be punished for permitting the kind of family voting sabagul and yatimov have experienced . 
but according to some ,  the penalties for permitting family voting are far outweighed by the incentives . 
the social democrat suggests that voter turnout will depend on how free the elections really are ,  and the extent to which the media - especially those under state control - impose self-censorship . 
the editor of a dushanbe newspaper ,  who asked not to be named ,  said media are forced into self-censorship . 
on the eve before elections ,  all editorial offices increase their level of self-censorship ,  especially those in the electronic media ,  which can lose their licenses for broadcasting just one wrong word . 
he recalled a recent incident at imruz ,  an independent radio station . 
but one political analyst told central asia online that self-censorship is not a big issue because ardent members of the opposition will not be allowed to register as candidates . 
under tajik law ,  all candidates must obtain <num>40,000</num>  signatures ,  but opposition figures say only those candidates approved by the government are registered and end up on the ballot . 
kazakhstan to use osce chairmanship to address afghanistan issues
kazakhstan will officially outline its goals for the organization for security and cooperation in europe on january <num>14</num>  .
astana ,  kazakhstan - since assuming chairmanship of organization for security and cooperation in europe  ( osce )  january <num>1</num>  , kazakhstan has been formulating its goals and priorities for its year-long leadership of the regional security organization . 
roman vassilenko ,  head of kazakhstans ministry of foreign affairs committee of international information ,  told central asia online that kazakhstan plans to make afghanistan one of the central issues under its chairmanship . 
we think the moment has come to unite the efforts of these countries to help the afghan people to begin to live a peaceful life ,  he said . 
vasilenko also said ,  kazakhstan is committed to democratization and deepening of the democratic reforms in the country ,  and the chairmanship can in stimulate the processes of democratization not only in kazakhstan ,  but in the whole region of central asia . 
with islamic migration to europe growing ,  another focus will be tolerance and non-discrimination . 
organizing an osce summit will be another goal . 
during the last meeting in athens  ( december <num>2009</num>  )  ,  the foreign ministers of osce member states expressed their interest in this idea and the permanent council in vienna will decide on the details ,  vasilenko said . 
he said kazakhstan has proposed a high-level osce conference in astana this june . 
kazakhstan is the first commonwealth of independent states country to chair the osce ,  and shamil midkhatovich yenikeyeff ,  research fellow on central asia from oxford university said it is an important foreign policy achievement . 
president nursultan nazarbaev could use the chairmanship to boost kazakhstans stance within the commonwealth of independent states ,  he said . 
for example ,  kazakhstan could facilitate a gradual improvement of russias relations with europe and the united states ,  as well as georgia ,  damaged by the russian-georgian military standoff of august <num>2008</num>  .
kazakhstan could also use the chairmanship to promote greater stability in central asia and the caucasus as well as afghanistan . 
we need to understand that the osce policy does not have clear rules on whom to give the chairmanship . 
we ,  at least ,  have freedom of speech ,  and media not controlled by the state ,  shamshet said . 
but others disagreed ,  saying the human rights situation in kazakhstan should disqualify the country from the osce chair . 
urnaliyev said that instead of cleaning up its situation before the chairmanship ,  the government continues to tighten the screws on society . 
the turkmen neutrality arch stands in the centre of ashgabat ,  topped by a golden statue of late president sapamurat niyazov . 
the arch is to be dismantled this year . 
 [ dmitry kostyukov / afp / getty images ] 
ashgabat - turkmen president gurbanguly berdymukhamedov has ordered the dismantling of the arch of neutrality and its statue of saparmurat niyazov ,  news media reported january <num>18</num>  .
according to radio free europe / radio liberty ,  berdymukhamedov ordered the move as part of his ongoing efforts to chip away at the cult of personality associated with niyazov ,  who presided over turkmenistan for <num>21</num>  years until his death in <num>2006</num>  .
among niyazovs other decrees was one renaming the month of april for his mother . 
completed in <num>1998</num>  , the archs construction was ordered by niyazov as a tribute to his nations permanent status as a neutral nation . 
the arch was built as a tripod and features a large glass elevator with ornate inscriptions as outer decorations . 
the <num>75</num> -metre structure is topped with a <num>12</num> -metre gold-plated statue of niyazov that rotates <num>360</num>  degrees over <num>24</num>  hours so that it always faces the sun .

migrants from uzbekistan ,  tajikistan ,  and other central asian countries who take such jobs in kazakhstan are finding it harder to get permission to work legally . 
 [ maxim marmur / afp / getty images ] 
almaty ,  kazakhstan - alikhan ,  a <num>29</num>  year-old bank employee in the capital complained he soon will have to find a new job . 
im from turkmenistan . 
my mother is turkmen and my father is kazakh ,  alikhan said . 
even with the higher education i received in almaty ,  i am not sure about the future . 
sino alizoda ,  from tajikistan ,  doesnt plan to look for a new job . 
the young man works as director of marketing for the mega shopping and entertainment centres in almaty . 
he thinks talk of massive reductions in jobs for non-kazakhs is exaggerated ,  and says change is good . 
conceptually ,  market changes have had a very positive macroeconomic character ,  you could even say sanitary ,  alizoda said . 
the market demands change and professional growth . 
i take great pleasure in being on the bit of these tendencies . 
it is time to start new projects and strengthen our existing position . 
this is what i am doing . 
when i came to kazakhstan ,  i worked informally for more than a year because getting a residency permit is highly bureaucratic and deliberately complicated process . 
ali emre ,  acting director of qqc sieger ,  which provides legal services to immigrants ,  said obtaining residency and legal employment documents is not easy . 
according to him ,  if a passports validity expires ,  then it cannot be used as proof of permanent residency in kazakhstan . 
construction ,  an industry that hires many migrant labourers ,  was one of the first to be hurt . 
maikhura ,  a teacher who came from uzbekistan ,  cannot find a job . 
with my higher education ,  i cannot imagine working in a market . 
she is in no hurry to get back to uzbekistan . 
many migrants are underemployed . 
at the green market in almaty the vendors include migrants from uzbekistan and tajikistan ,  many with higher educations . 
zainab ,  from tashkent ,  who works in a sewing stall in the green market on the south side of the capital ,  has a teaching degree . 
she works as a seamstress because she could not find a better job . 
my husband also works here ,  zainab said . 
what is most important ,  according to zainab ,  is not to go hungry . 
the life of a migrant worker became more difficult after june <num>2008</num>  , when changes were made to the law on migration ,  said an employee of the centre for the support of labour migrants in almaty . 
the process of obtaining a license to work has itself become more difficult . 
in order to prevent an increase in unemployed people ,  the ministry of labour and social protection has developed a programme ,  according to which new jobs will be created in major cities ,  said director of the department of employment under the ministry of labour and social protection of people ,  amanzhol nurseitov . 
every year ,  before september <num>1</num>  , employers must submit an application for recruiting foreign labour . 
in <num>2008</num>  , a quota for <num>131,600</num>  people was approved ,  <num>1.6</num>  percent of the economically active population ,  said nurseitov . 
in <num>2009</num>  it was <num>63,500</num>  people ,  <num>0.7</num>  percent . 
nurseitov said that on june <num>1</num>  , <num>2008</num>  new laws on the residency of foreign citizens came into effect . 
this change was made in order to provide the labour market in kazakhstan with qualified specialists and protect the able-bodied population of kazakhstan . 
within the city limits of almaty ,  where the principle number of migrant workers from central asia are concentrated ,  the quota  ( in <num>2008</num>  )  was <num>12,025</num>  people ,  said ayan asanov ,  deputy chief of the migration police in almaty . 
in <num>2009</num>  , the quota was just <num>6,000</num>  , he said . 
the number who want to work in kazakhstan is a lot larger . 
the result ,  he said ,  is that most migrant workers from central asia work illegally . 
kazakh president sets strategy for development until <num>2020</num> 
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev ,  shown in a file photo ,  gave his annual message to the nation january <num>29</num>  .
he discussed the countrys recent economic growth and said the country has achieved its social goals for the decade . 
 [ stanislav filippov / afp / getty images ] 
astana -- kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev gave his traditional annual message to the people of kazakhstan at a joint session of parliament january <num>29</num>  .
my main goal is to guarantee the countrys economic growth in the coming decade and to open the road to new opportunities . 
my message today is devoted to this theme ,  he said in delivering the address titled the new decade ,  new economic growth - new opportunities for kazakhstan . 
declaring kazakhstan one of the fastest-developing countries in the world ,  the president announced that the international holdings and reserves of the countrys national endowment fund now exceed us <num>50</num>  $  billion ,  and have grown more than <num>25</num> -fold over the past <num>10</num>  years . 
according to nazarbayev ,  kazakhstan has solved all the social tasks facing it in the first decade of the 21st century . 
we have begun to live as we planned to and have achieved the goals we set  ( for ourselves )  . 
the average monthly salary in these years has grown five-fold ,  the average pension three-fold ,  the percentage of the population with an income falling below the poverty line has fallen four-fold from <num>50</num>  to <num>12</num>  percent ,  and the populations basic health indicators have improved ,  he said . 
nazarbayev said the un has recognised kazakhstans achievements ,  and listed kazakhstan as one of the countries with a high level of human potential in <num>2009</num>  .
this is indisputable evidence of our growing well-being ,  the president said . 
now ,  kazakhstan will move to accomplish strategy <num>2020</num>  .
nazarbayev said the goals of strategy <num>2020</num>  are to realize steady economic growth through accelerated industrialization and infrastructure development . 
in the speech ,  he announced plans to transfer us <num>8</num>  $  billion from the national endowment fund to the state budget starting in <num>2010</num>  .
there wont be any loans from the national fund or any other additional transfer payments to the budget . 
taking into account these steps ,  the national funds assets by <num>2020</num>  should grow to us <num>90</num>  $  billion ,  which is not less than <num>30</num>  percent of the gdp ,  he said . 
turning to social issues ,  the president proposed a new approach for providing affordable housing . 
members of parliament applauded nazarbayevs announcement that a <num>25</num>  percent increase in funding for scholarships and salaries for government workers would take effect april <num>1</num>  , rather than july <num>1</num>  , as initially expected . 
the president connected the countrys key foreign policy priorities to its chairmanship of the osce during <num>2010</num>  .
nazarbayev said kazakhstans chairmanship of the osce will be directed toward developing security and encouraging the development of the entire worlds peoples . 
dosym satpaev ,  kazakh political scientist and director of the risk assessment group ,  said the content of the presidents message to the people of kazakhstan didnt match its title . 
in his opinion ,  this message is useful above all to state structures and to the bureaucrats who essentially prepared it . 
the people arent interested in grandiose words about macroeconomics and so forth ,  he said . 
theyre interested in appropriate levels for salaries and pensions . 
also ,  the people are interested in low inflation so that prices dont jump . 
he begins by expressing support for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for an increase in pensions and salaries . 
but he doesnt take into account that the governments actions have a different effect . 
they ,  to the contrary ,  inflict serious damage on these or other social obligations - take for example last years devaluation ,  he said . 
amirzhan kosanov ,  secretary-general of the azat national social-democratic party ,  said that the presidents message contained a great many economic tasks but said nothing concrete about political reforms and democracy . 
in his message he always skates around this sphere ,  the most important one for kazakhstan . 
nazarbayev gave his first such speech in <num>1997</num>  .

the islamic rebirth party was recognised by <num>69</num>  percent ,  while the communist party  ( <num>61</num>  percent )  and the democratic party  ( <num>42</num>  percent )  had widespread name recognition ,  too .

no other party commanded a high percentage of support .

the organisation for security and co-operation in europe  ( osce )  and the embassy of great britain funded the poll ;  the shark research centre conducted it . 
kyrgyz authorities trying to regulate nonprofits
the kyrgyz parliament meets to vote on a bill in this <num>2009</num>  file photo . 
a bill introduced by some members of parliament would impose restrictions on nonprofit organisations . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
bishkek - the kyrgyz parliament ,  or jogorku kenesh ,  is discussing a proposal to more closely regulate non-profit and non-governmental organisations . 
one of the amendments proponents ,  iskhak masaliyev ,  leader of the communist party and of the parliamentary leftist faction ,  said a sense of order was essential . 
everything must be transparent ,  he said . 
in our country it is directly prohibited for political parties to get financing from foreign sources ,  but ,  regarding nonprofits ,  there is no such prohibition . 
in the meantime ,  almost all of them receive funding from outside kyrgyzstan . 
aziza abdirasulova ,  head of the human rights centre kylym shamy  ( torch of the century )  ,  agreed on transparency for nonprofits but not on regulation . 
how nonprofits and political parties can be compared ,  i dont understand ,  abdirasulova said . 
parties fight for power . 
of course it is unacceptable for someone from abroad to be able to finance a real political power . 
marat kazakpayev ,  political science professor at kyrgyz-russian slavonic university ,  collaborates with nonprofits extensively as a political consultant . 
i am afraid that in this situation ,  a gradual fallback to authoritarianism may occur ,  he said . 
there is a very cumbersome nonprofit system . 
they are gathered into some sort of big association that reports directly to the government . 
… in its own time ,  the uzbek authorities began the very same way as what masaliyev is now proposing :  a prohibition on funding nonprofits from abroad . 
 ( kyrgyzstan )  itself is constantly receiving all sorts of loans ,  tranches and donations . 
everything is transparent and everything is open ,  she said . 
we pay taxes-they check us constantly . 
where do these millions of dollars that the government borrows go ? 
no one knows . 
masaliyev says nonprofits are striving for influence in the country ,  including through participation in demonstrations . 
these are baseless accusations ,  abdirasulova said . 
masaliyev said we are participating in picketing and rallies ,  but this is the political right of any citizen of the country ! 
… the civil sector can observe elections and trial proceedings . 
we do not nominate parliamentary or presidential candidates . 
so what political participation and pursuits can this talk be about ? 
a third proposed change would require nonprofits to clearly describe the scope of their activities and could limit them to doing only those types of programmes or work listed in their charter . 
masaliyev said nonprofits now work under the principle that it is possible to do anything that is not prohibited by law . 
last year ,  nonprofits held several roundtables dedicated to the proposed amendments . 
human rights activists say that the jogorku kenesh is hesitating to make a decision thanks to the nonprofits vigorous defence of their interests . 
deputies have sent back masaliyevs initiative several times for revision . 
the communist party leader himself confirmed the activists opinion :  you know ,  there is a saying :  the honey is sweet ,  but the bee stings . 
on the one hand ,  we all understand that this is necessary ,  but on the other ,  our government is also heavily dependent on international organisations . 
the number of nonprofits in kyrgyzstan is unclear . 
parliamentarians masaliyev and avtandil arabayev say the number is <num>10,000</num>  , as estimated by the ministry of justice . 
but parliamentarian alisher mamasaliyev put the number at <num>545</num>  .
kazakpayev points out that everybody may be right :  the thing is that <num>10,000</num>  may indeed be registered ,  but there are actually only <num>500</num>  working . 
many nonprofits register and then exist only on paper <abbr>…</abbr>  because they dont succeed in getting a grant . 
so they just hang around with a zero balance . 
the government still has not figured out what to do about this situation . 
kyrgyz opposition demonstrates ,  demands economic and political reforms
kyrgyz opposition supporters hold flags and posters as they listen to speakers at a rally in bishkek march <num>17</num>  .
demonstrators convened a kurultai or peoples assembly to protest alleged human rights abuses and the economic situation . 
they also called for the release of perceived political prisoners ,  including former kyrgyz defence minister ismail isakov  ( on poster )  ,  currently serving an eight-year prison sentence . 
bishkek - thousands of opposition supporters turned out in bishkek and naryn march <num>17</num>  for a kurultai - peoples assembly - to protest price increases for electricity and heat ,  privatisation of telecom and energy providers and restrictions on the media . 
they also demanded the release of perceived political prisoners ,  including former minister of defence islam iskhakov . 
opposition leaders called on demonstrators to become active and to stand up to the government . 
people who will not give jobs to their relatives ,  but will lead the country down the road of progress . 
organisers estimate <num>3,500</num>  people turned out in bishkek ,  and <num>3,000</num>  in naryn . 
the interior ministry estimated the bishkek crowd at <num>1,500</num>  but did not provide figures for naryn . 
demonstrations in support of the kurultai were reported in other parts of the country . 
after the crowd voiced its support for the reforms ,  organisers named an executive committee and set a deadline of march <num>24</num>  for the government to begin implementing the reforms . 
organisers said if their demands remain unmet by the deadline ,  they will begin organising similar kurultai around the country to create a true peoples power . 
i came to see with my own eyes and to hear with my own ears those who are opposed to  ( kurmanbek )  bakiyevs regime ,  said keneshbai turuyev . 
theres no light ,  the utility rates have gone up ,  i pay half my pension just for heat . 
the leaders of the opposition are right - you cant treat the people this way ! 
so i am going to support our oppositionists . 
they say they have alternatives as to how to straighten out our economy and energy situation . 
but zhildizbek ,  a <num>20</num>  year-old student ,  said he trusts neither the government nor the opposition . 
i just came to have a look ,  and will think about what theyre offering ,  he said . 
if they wanted to change something ,  they would have done so a long time ago . 
they just jump back and forth . 
from the white house ,  to the opposition ,  from the opposition to the white house . 
kurultai organisers selected march <num>17</num>  to mark the anniversary of a <num>2002</num>  protest in the kyrgyz city of aksy ,  where at least six people died when police fired on unarmed demonstrators . 
opposition wary of kyrgyz kurultai results
bishkek -- in the wake of the first kurultai in kyrgyzstan ,  observers are asking whether the country needed it and whether it met its goals . 
the opposition boycotted it . 
social-democratic member of parliament isa omurkulov said ,  right now ,  a dialogue among the different political forces is more important . 
its not like we have a civil war or internecine violence . 
we need a dialogue among political forces ;  we need to figure out which direction to take the country . 
we  ( oppositionists )  held such a kurultai a week ago ,  but the government ignored it . 
toktaiym umetaliyeva ,  leader of the kyrgyz coalition of nongovernmental and nonprofit organisations ,  skipped the kurultai ,  calling the event a step backward for the country in an evolutionary and democratic sense . 
and what was it ? 
the purpose ,  as set up by the presidents promoters and family ,  was advancement of consultative democracy and a gradual rejection of the electoral system . 
among other things ,  delegates at the kuraltai supported a resolution for a consultative democracy . 
president kurmanbek bakiyev had spoken for such a form of government ,  one that relies on kuraltai and dialogue with the people rather than elections ,  as the best option for kyrgyzstan . 
umetaliyeva expressed certainty that in two years ,  when the time comes to pick a new set of delegates to the kurultai of accord ,  bakiyevs son would be named head of state . 
they want to use the kurultai of accord to solve the states most important problems . 
marat kazakpayev ,  professor of political science and conflict resolution at kyrgyz-russian slavic university ,  said the kurultai raised questions that arouse popular interest and that the government can solve . 
bakiyev expressed satisfaction with the kurultai . 
the kurultais goals have been achieved . 
everything that had to be said has been said by the delegates ,  he said in his concluding speech . 
aziza abdirasulova ,  head of the kylym shamy human rights group ,  spoke at the kurultai about legal protection for kyrgyz citizens . 
in her opinion ,  the government at least heard about the problems of the people . 
what comes next is important ,  she said . 
if the government tries to solve the problems  ( we )  raised ,  itll prove that this idea succeeded . 
the kurultai ,  which formally concluded march <num>25</num>  , continued at the government level . 
kurultai participants met with cabinet ministers to detail complaints and ideas . 
kurultai presidium chairman sadykbek ablesov said the presidium will meet at least once a quarter ,  owing to the large number of complaints and requests from the people . 
there are <num>17</num>  of us in the presidium ,  he said . 
well figure out a general working plan in a week . 
well convey the essential issues not to the president but to concrete ministries and agencies ,  straight to the bureaucrats who are responsible for handling this or that problem . 
the majority of representatives of international organisations refused to publicly evaluate the kurultai . 
speaking on condition of anonymity ,  a diplomat posted at an embassy in bishkek said ,  a meeting of the government and the people in any case is a sufficiently positive and democratic step ,  but its too early to draw any conclusions . 
turkmen public libraries begin re-opening
berdymukhammedov ,  who has led the country since niyazovs death in <num>2006</num>  , said the move came from a need to review turkmenbashis policies and expressed his readiness to comprehensively carry out great reforms . 
calling the reforms throughout turkmen life the new renaissance ,  berdymukhammedov drew attention to the role and position of intellectuals ,  artists and art in the process of renewing society . 
the turkmen government has decided per berdymukhammedovs decree to begin reviving culture by opening rural art schools ,  libraries and cultural centres . 
in all ,  <num>140</num>  public libraries will open  ( niyazov did not close school libraries )  . 
old libraries are undergoing renovation ,  while some areas without libraries are building new ones . 
according to the decree ,  the galkynysh book centre will provide books for libraries . 
niyazov ,  who ruled the country for <num>20</num>  years ,  banned opera ,  ballet ,  cinema and circus performances because they did not conform to the national mentality . 
we hope that now our distinctive culture will have a chance to develop ,  said <num>36</num> -year-old maisa ,  a teacher at a turkmen university . 
for the past few years ,  our esteemed president has done much to this end ,  restoring the libraries and national opera ,  ordering the reconstruction of cinemas and opening the renovated state circus . 
i like the decision to restore the countrys library system ,  said <num>44</num> -year-old aina ,  a city librarian . 
but this task is difficult . 
the library stacks are generally empty ,  and new foreign publications havent arrived for many years . 
turkmen university teachers will shoulder much of the burden of refilling those empty stacks . 
they publish their scientific papers in booklet form for their students and place the copies in the library . 
they cannot publish thousands of copies of them . 
despite the libraries opening ,  there are practically no books ,  said librarian valida . 
they promised a delivery in april ,  but they still havent brought anything . 
… it is still tolerable at the central libraries ,  but it is worse in the provinces . 
my colleagues say that you can count the number of books on your fingers . 
the country faces another important issue in opening libraries :  the establishment of schools to train librarians . 
but the state has yet to make any commitments in this regard . 
in addition ,  the government requires all creative works to pass censorship before entering mass circulation . 
the foundation for support of non-profit ngos to be created under the auspices of uzbekistans parliament
in july ,  the legislative chamber of uzbekistans parliament convened a session under speaker <abbr>d.</abbr> 
tashmukhamedova ,  and addressed this issue . 
today ,  uzbekistans most popular slogan is :  from a strong government to a strong civil society . 
uzbeks seek to bolster the institutions of political parties ,  ngos ,  the media ,  self-organising citizens groups and other institutions of civil society . 
participating in the conference were deputies from the parliament's legislative chamber ,  representatives of the makhalla foundation ,  the nuroniy organisation ,  the women's committee ,  as well as political parties . 
nonetheless ,  a representative of one of the parties admitted that the nation's general population did not hold much stock in local ngos . 
 " our task now is to convince the citizens that non-governmental non-profit organisations are quite capable of dealing with the problems of normal people . 
i feel confident that we'll find the right approach to solve this issue ,  "  he said . 
parliamentary member and representative of the liberal-democratic party of uzbekistan ravshan akhunov is convinced that  " only independent ,  free ,  self-sufficient and adequately financed ngos and other institutions of civil society can perform the duties that are entrusted to them .  "

brazilian football school trains kazakh juniors
two young footballers try to outrace each other to chase down a loose ball in almaty . 
more than two dozen teenage players have begun a three-year educational program at the ole brasil club football academy in sao paulo . 
 [ maral tazhibayeva ] 
almaty ,  kazakhstan - brazil and kazakhstan are half-way around the world from one another ,  and have very different languages and customs . 
but the two countries have at least one thing in common :  football is more than just a sport - it is a national obsession . 
this shared passion is bringing the two countries closer together through a new program that sends kazakh youth to a football academy in brazil for three years . 
shortly before new years ,  the first <num>26</num>  kazakh enrolees in the ole brasil club football academy in sao paulo returned home for a holiday break . 
kazakhstan has allocated <num>83</num>  million kzt  ( us <num>550,000</num>  $  )  to fund the training for athletes <num>13</num>  to <num>15</num>  years old . 
the program is operated under kazakhstans bolashak  ( future )  education program . 
berik shaikhov said the chance for the kazakhs to distinguish themselves came just two weeks after the start of training ,  when their team took part in the sao paulo juniors cup . 
both shaikhov and sariyev have noticed that training at ole brasil is significantly different from that of kazakh sports schools . 
they added that they particularly liked the atmosphere and the real cult of football - something that kazakhstans attitude toward football cannot yet match . 
both boys parents said that their children have changed not only physically ,  but also psychologically ,  having become much more confident . 
the boys said there are representatives of many countries in the ole brasil clubs football academy ,  but they are the only ones from the former soviet union . 
sariyev noted that in contrast to the kazakh students in the bolashak programme ,  half of which do not return to the country ,  all of the junior football players plan to play right at home . 
i think that something good will come out of the boys training in brazil now ,  aleksandr arefiev ,  the coach of kazakhstans select juniors told central asia online . 
not only do they learn to play ,  they also learn to win ,  and this is no less important than physical training and technique . 
the psychology of a winner ;  that is what kazakhs are often lacking on the football field . 
south asian giant seeks to reclaim field hockey glory

the 10t hockey world cup begins february <num>28</num>  in new delhi .

peshawar -- pakistans been waiting for <num>16</num>  years for another chance to win the world cup . 
but reigning olympic mens field hockey champion and two-time defending world champion germany stands in its way this year . 
germany will attempt to become the first nation to win the title three times in a row when the 10t hockey world cup starts february <num>28</num>  in the indian capital ,  new delhi . 
the final is scheduled for march <num>13</num>  .
the tournament has two six-team brackets comprised of asian teams and european powerhouses . 
group a includes argentina ,  canada ,  germany ,  south korea ,  the netherlands and new zealand ;  group b contains australia ,  england ,  india ,  pakistan ,  south africa and spain . 
statistics make the defending champions look invincible . 
germany has lost only <num>3</num>  of <num>30</num>  world cup matches since <num>1994</num>  .
spain is responsible for all three defeats . 
germany is one of only five nations to qualify for every world cup ,  a distinction it shares with india ,  the netherlands ,  pakistan and spain . 
i believe germany will prove a formidable power to beat in this world cup ,  waqar maroof ,  a hockey expert ,  told central asia online . 
the germans are favourites to retain the title unless other europeans pull off a surprise . 
asias teams are considered underdogs this year ,  with australia ,  the netherlands ,  england and spain considered contenders to win . 
some pundits say australia appears as ready as it has ever been to win its second world cup . 
it won in <num>1986</num>  .
the pundits say spain has a window of opportunity ,  since it won silver at the <num>2008</num>  olympics in beijing . 
the iberian country has won seven medals in world cup tournaments and olympiads ,  but never gold . 
meanwhile ,  the netherlands must fend off two recent nemeses - australia and germany - if it wants to win gold . 
in addition ,  argentina ,  england and south korea are challenges for the dutchmen . 
the south koreans ,  who have never won a major tournament ,  still are regarded as a threat . 
they took second place in the <num>1999</num>  champions trophy and the <num>2000</num>  olympics in sydney . 
hockey watchers have warned other countries not to take seoul lightly . 
pakistan ,  a blend of youth and experience ,  will is going all-out in pursuit of the glory it last enjoyed in <num>1994</num>  in sydney . 
the south asian country has suffered a <num>16</num> -year drought at the tournament but has a record four world cups ,  winning in barcelona  ( <num>1971</num>  )  ,  buenos aires  ( <num>1978</num>  )  ,  bombay  ( <num>1982</num>  )  and sydney  ( <num>1994</num>  )  . 
it also took olympic gold three times . 
the team left for new delhi in high spirits ,  but former players and longtime hockey observers consider it an underdog . 
i think this team is improving since the new management of the pakistan hockey federation took over ,  but <abbr>…</abbr>  we should not have high expectations ,  former olympian rahim khan said . 
pakistan ,  ranked seventh in the world ,  is scheduled to play neighbour and rival india february <num>28</num>  at 8 . 05p pakistani time . 
promoters are touting the match as the most thrilling and most worth watching .

debutant penalty-corner specialist sandeep singh scored two goals to help india defeat pakistan <num>4</num> -<num>1</num>  in the 12t mens field hockey world cup in new delhi february <num>28</num>  .
it was indias biggest win over pakistan and its first over its neighbour since a <num>2</num> -<num>1</num>  decision in <num>1975</num>  .
the long-sought victory made the home crowd euphoric . 
pakistani players appeared nervous ,  committing unforced errors and turning the ball over while india took advantage of an uncoordinated pakistani defence . 
india might have scored more had pakistani goalkeeper salman akbar not thwarted some sure opportunities . 
akbar stopped three major scoring chances in the first <num>17</num>  minutes ,  including a penalty-corner . 
but after another good run by forward prabjhot singh late in the first half ,  shivendra singh cleanly collected the ball off a rebound to slot in indias first goal . 
sandeep singh scored on a penalty-corner in the last minute of the first-half . 
pakistan tried to respond ,  but penalty-corner specialist sohail abbas clanged his powerful drag-flick off the cross-bar twice . 
former pakistani team captain sami ullah blamed the defeat on individual play . 
there was no coordination between the defence and forward lines ,  and i think the players looked nervous because of the huge indian crowd ,  he said . 
what is important is to put up a good show . 
the results make little difference if you play well . 
our players could not possess the ball to attack the indian goal . 
pakistan will play spain on march <num>2</num>  .

 [ asif hassan / afp / getty images ] 
peshawar -- pakistan has a world cricket title to defend and intends to do it ,  team captain shahid afridi vowed . 
but his team will have to do it without experienced top-order batsmen muhammad yousaf and younas khan ,  all-rounder shoaib malik ,  and ace fast bowler umar gul in the international cricket council  ( icc )  t20 world cup <num>2010</num>  .
afridi ,  whom commentators call boom boom for his habit of putting bowlers to the sword ,  told reporters his team is ready . 
without the prayers of the nation and supporters ,  pakistan cannot achieve anything ,  he said . 
he dispelled the impression that he is under any kind of pressure . 
i like to lead the team from the front because it is my style and i always believe in the aggressive approach ,  said afridi ,  who played a key role in pakistans triumph in the <num>2009</num>  icc t20 world cup in england . 
observers fear the lineup looks weak without yousaf and younas . 
they captained the team in the past . 
another missing face is the reliable all-rounder shoaib ,  who recently married indian tennis star sania mirza . 
he lost his slot on disciplinary grounds . 
the exclusion of yousaf ,  younas and shoaib follows recommendations by an investigative committee that accused them of disrupting team spirit during a recent tour in australia . 
in this tournaments shorter version of the game  ( called one-day international )  ,  it can be any teams day if it plays well . 
however ,  pakistan is a force to reckon with and can defend its title if its lineup clicks . 
one team playing for the first time in this top-class tournament that deserves serious attention ,  experts said ,  is afghanistan . 
the war-torn country qualified for the world cup even though it lacks a home cricket field . 
look out for afghanistan ,  warned iqbal sikander ,  the asian cricket councils development officer and member of pakistans <num>1992</num>  world cup-winning team . 
the afghan team has the potential to beat any team in the tournament ,  he said ,  pointing to the afghans mix of spin and fast bowlers ,  batsmen and all-rounders . 
captain nawroz mangal ,  mohammad nabi ,  karim sadiq and samiullah shinwari are key for afghanistan . 
they hope to distinguish themselves in this tournament and to gain test status from the icc ,  enabling them to play the longest version of the game . 
only ten national teams have test status .

bridgetown ,  barbados -- poor fielding doomed pakistan in a crucial may <num>6</num>  match against england in the super eight stage of icc twenty20 world cup play in the west indies ,  frustrating coach waqar younas . 
chasing a <num>148</num> -run target ,  england lost four wickets to achieve its total in the 20t over with three balls to go . 
sloppy fielding gave the english batsmen life after life . 
the <num>148</num> -run target was defendable ,  experts believed . 
but poor fielding and unimpressive bowling let pakistan down . 
off-spinner saeed ajmal dropped three catches ,  including a routine chance at mid-on from craig kieswetter when the england batsman had yet to open his account . 
were not out of the tournament ,  so we dont really have to worry about that . 
new zealand ,  who lost by <num>13</num>  runs to south africa ,  is pakistans next opponent ,  may <num>8</num>  .
captain shahid afridi said , we missed our opportunities  ( against england )  ,  and you cant afford to miss opportunities ,  afridi said . 
we are working hard ,  but right now i dont know why we are missing  ( them )  . 
i thought <num>147</num>  was a decent total ,  maybe <num>15</num>  runs short - but with our bowling attack ,  i thought we could have managed it ,  the pakistani coach added . 
scolari leaving bunyodkor
luiz felipe scolari ,  who did not win the asian football confederation championship ,  announced he will leave fc bunyodkor . 
he said the team was trying to save money by cutting his <num>18</num> -month contract short .

tashkent -- luis felipe scolari ,  coach of fc bunyodkor tashkent ,  announced his planned departure ,  news media reported may <num>24</num>  .
the announcement comes just six months after he turned down juventus fc in turin ,  italy ,  to stay with bunyodkor . 
the team has run into financial trouble because it has links to zeromax ,  a conglomerate with a us <num>24</num>  . debt under investigation by uzbek authorities . 
he reportedly wants a job in europe or his native brazil . 
scolari expressed gratitude for uzbek hospitality in a statement on the team website .

johannesburg ,  south africa -- ravshan irmatov ,  a <num>32</num> -year-old uzbek football referee ,  will have the highest-profile assignment of his life june <num>11</num>  .
he will officiate the opening match of the world cup in johannesburg ,  when south africa confronts mexico . 
fifas decision to have central asians officiate the first match -- when europe and south america have the worlds strongest football teams -- is considered prestigious for uzbekistan . 
only once before has an asian referee officiated the opening world cup match ;  in <num>2002</num>  in south korea ,  ali busailim of the uae was in charge . 
to the rest of the world ,  irmatov might be little known ,  but he has refereed five other tournament championships  ( including the <num>2008</num>  fifa club world cup and the <num>2007</num>  fifa u-17 world cup )  and has twice been named asian football confederation referee of the year . 
most fifa referees start out as assistants . 
but irmatovs skills caught the eye of the afc ,  which recommended him to fifa .

weapon handover spreads peaceful future
all across afghanistan ,  stockpiles of weapons and ammunition are voluntarily handed over to police and army officials under the disbandment of illegal armed groups  ( diag )  programme . 
a pile of old rifles confiscated by the afghan police sits in a tent at a joint base for afghan national army and police ,  and nato units along the khost-gardez highway . 
 ( photo by scott peterson / getty images ) 
diag was launched in june <num>2005</num>  , after it was officially announced by vice president abdul karim khalili . 
there is no longer a need for arms . 
people need to understand that unless they give up their illegal weapons we cannot create a secure environment . 
the police need to be in control in the districts ,  said sangee . 
today ,  arms are being used in robberies and to harm local residents . 
thousands of afghans are voluntarily handing in their weapons and ammunition in recognition of the countrys civil war being a thing of the past . 
there is no longer a need for people to hold on to their weapons which they may have used previously to protect themselves during years of war . 
now they can help establish peace and stability by handing them back to the government ,  said interior minister zarar ahmad muqbil . 
the weapons are now under the surveillance of the afghan national army . 
they will be used by the security forces of the elected government of afghanistan or-if unsafe-destroyed . 
several programmes throughout the country have been set up so that former fighters who deliver weapons will receive skills training to start a new profession . 
there are several advertisements throughout the country encouraging people to give up arms . 
diag officials have held meetings with over <num>40,000</num>  mullahs across the country encouraging them to spread the important message of handing over arms . 
the agriculture department is working with a number of families who have chosen to give up their arms in exchange for skills training . 
mehrab ,  a student in herat ,  said he is very happy to no longer hear the sound of weapons . 
he said ,  i now feel more comfortable driving long distances and do not worry about my safety the same way i had to before . 
tthere can be no doubt that afghanistans education system rotted under the taliban . 
since the hard line regime was toppled in <num>2001</num>  , progress in education has been hard won . 
the summary of achievements listed on the ministry of educations website make that abundantly clear . 
another problem is the shortage of textbooks . 
however ,  there was some cheer recently as the minister for education ,  mohammad hanif atmar ,  started the distribution of <num>60</num>  million textbooks to school children around afghanistan . 
so far ,  <num>30</num>  million books have been delivered . 
of those ,  <num>20</num>  million are currently being handed out and another <num>10</num>  million are sitting in warehouses waiting for the distribution teams to be ready . 
another <num>30</num>  million books are on order . 
the ministry hopes to be able to distribute a total of <num>45</num>  million books this year and <num>15</num>  million the following year . 
the textbooks handed out to children in grades one though six are based on the new curriculum that was designed last year . 
the books given to pupils in grades seven through <num>12</num>  are revised editions of books designed under the old curriculum . 
but this is a temporary situation - new books following the new curriculum will be ordered once there is a new syllabus . 
the books are in afghanistans official languages :  dari and pashto . 
there are also six books ,  previously unavailable ,  teaching the other languages prevalent in afghanistan . 
these are written in uzbek ,  turkmen ,  baluchi ,  pashai ,  nuristani and pamiry . 
as well as covering traditional lesson subjects ,  the books also touch on topics such as human rights ,  the natural environment and the fight against drugs . 
this makes them somewhat different from the textbooks of the past . 
there are also new books for religious education . 
the aim of the government is to develop a curriculum and textbooks for islamic education ,  built on modern principles of inclusion and tolerance . 
so ,  in a departure from prior norms ,  the religious books have incorporated ,  for the first time ,  both the hanafi  ( sunni )  and jafari  ( shia )  schools of thought . 
religious statements in the old books ,  which could be considered as inviting people to violence and resentment ,  have been omitted . 
denmark ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  the independent commission for human rights and the counter narcotics ministry provided the funds for the books . 
kyrgyz opposition prepares to protest falsification of election results in octobers local elections
at yesterdays meeting an appeal was adopted that addresses the systemic crisis that has arisen in kyrgyzstan . 
confirmation of this crisis can be seen in the continuing price increases for foodstuffs ,  the situation that has arisen with respect to the fuel-and-energy sector ,  and the pressures on freedom of speech . 
early elections to determine the deputies for the zhogorku keneshu took place in december <num>2007</num>  .
soon after ,  in late october ,  kyrgyzstan adopted a new constitution and president kurmanbek bakiyev dissolved the parliament . 
only the presidential party ,  ak zhol ,  and two other parties that are totally loyal to the authorities made it into the parliament . 
as a result of the defeat of the opposition parties  ( including ata meken ,  the embodiment of the united opposition )  ,  eminent opposition figures find themselves out of the zhogorku keneshu . 
kyrgyzstans supreme court ,  to which the losers have appealed ,  has only confirmed and reinforced the decision of the central electoral committee . 
since they do not sense any serious support from the electorate ,  the opposition leaders have decided to refrain from any mass protest actions . 
nuclear power plant .

several factors contribute to the complex nature of the energy sphere in kyrgyzstan . 
the main method for generating electric power in the country ,  as is well known ,  is its hydroelectric power plants . 
last year there was a sharp decline in the flow of water in the toktogul reservoir . 
previously the rate of the flow of water to the toktogul power plant  ( kyrgyzstans main generating station )  was <num>1,700</num>  cubic metres per second ;  today it is only <num>700</num>  cubic metres per second . 
as a result there have been systematic blackouts of electric power for the public ,  and it has already been announced by the government that the prospect looms of a price increase for electric power . 
the reaction of the public to the energy crisis is ,  of course ,  very negative . 
abdynasyrov notes that the powers that be have made and are making obvious mistakes that directly affect the lives and well-being of ordinary members of the public ,  even those who have no interest in politics at all . 
the idea of building a thermal power plant at the kara-kech coal field was raised ,  for the first time ,  during the <num>1960</num>  second  . 
further details on the project for building the kavaksk regional power plant were worked on in <num>1982</num> -<num>1983</num>  on orders from the former soviet union state planning committee . 
the technical and economic specifications were drawn up for developing the deposit itself and for building a regional power plant or a plant using a condensation system ,  on the basis of this coal ,  rated at <num>1,200</num>  megawatts .

strategic reserves of food wheat in the country are between <num>400,000</num>  and <num>600,000</num>  tonnes ,  which ,  experts say ,  is quite enough for a food product cushion for uzbekistans <num>27</num>  million people . 
during the soviet era ,  neighbouring kazakhstan used to supply uzbekistan with cereals and flour ,  receiving fruit and vegetables in return . 
but the uzbek leader ,  islam karimov ,  decided that it would be safer not to rely on food deliveries from its northern neighbour and that everything that was needed would be grown inside the country . 
and an uzbek source who was present at the talks ,  has reported in a telephone interview ,  on condition of anonymity ,  that the colleagues from astrakhan assured the uzbek side that the volume of the deliveries will be as required even if the district has to agree to additional deliveries with their neighbours . 
for thirty years ,  the location of the grave of afghanistans first president ,  sardar mohammad daoud khan ,  has been the closely held secret of a select few . 
daoud khan overthrew his cousin king mohammad zahir in a <num>1973</num>  coup . 
he established a republic of which he became president . 
daoud khan ruled until he himself was assassinated in a soviet-backed coup . 
earlier this year ,  a commission was set up to find and indentify the bodies . 
on june <num>25</num>  , pacha mir was called upon to reveal the location of the graves in which he had buried the bodies <num>30</num>  years earlier . 
in an interview with the times ,  pacha mir recalled how he knew he was going to have to find his way back to the burial spot some time . 
among those helping in the process is daouds granddaughter zahra ghazi ,  who was <num>16</num>  at the time of the assassinations . 
the familys servants have also been called on to help with the identification . 
faizullah kaker ,  deputy minister of pubic health and head of the investigation commission ,  told reporters that <num>18</num>  of the <num>29</num>  bodies had been identified as family members and <num>11</num>  as body guards . 
they are the presidents wife ,  sister ,  three daughters ,  son ,  grandson and a daughter- and son-in-law . 
they were identified through their clothing ,  teeth ,  height and other characteristics ,  according to kaker . 
were <num>100</num>  percent sure about our findings ,  he said . 
the government is currently discussing a special burial in kabul befitting a president once all the bodies have been identified .

in a ceremony which was held at <num>209</num>  ana corps in mazar-e sharif ,  the defence ministrys chief of staff ,  general bismillah mohammadi ,  inaugurated the qrf on a military base in northern afghanistan . 
we didnt have a well-built army for a long time . 
but now we have a powerful army ,  he said . 
the qrfs will be under the direct control of the afghan ministry of defence and undertake missions in different areas of afghanistan when needed . 
our qrfs will be able to fight against any enemies who are trying to make our country insecure ,  said general mohammadi . 
general mohammadi said that the most difficult part of being in the army is the shortage of equipment that occurs as it continues to expand . 
we still use the old-fashion russian weapons that sometime do not work properly . 
as we continue to get better equipment in ,  we will be better able to squash the enemy ,  he says . 
he also is grateful for the presence of international troops in afghanistan ,  saying that nato has been critical in helping assist in missions in the southern part of the country where most of the insurgency is taking place . 
people all across the country are proud when they ana soldiers patrol ,  he adds . 
reza muhammad ,  a teacher in balkh province ,  says ,  we feel more secure when we see ana soldiers . 
they are powerful ,  strong and well trained men that are protecting us from warlords and insurgents . 
during the parliamentary elections they helped ensure security ,  allowing our country to vote in a safe atmosphere ,  he said . 
general gul agah naeebi ,  deputy commander of <num>209</num>  shaheen corps ,  says the real threats in afghanistan also include illegal groups that still operate in many districts of the country . 
there are some elements of pro-taliban groups who are trying to create insecurity in the province . 
we plan to identify these groups and disarm them so they are no longer a threat ,  says general naeebi . 
tajik athletes win silver and bronze for the first time in beijing
in addition ,  she said ,  the outflow of the best coaches from the republic lowered the overall level of training for the athletes . 
tajikistan athletes will return to their homeland following the official closing ceremony of the olympic games in beijing on august <num>24</num>  .
the united states continues to provide assistance to tajikistan in the security sphere
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  embassy in tajikistan reported that the facilities include a registration and border-control hall ,  control-and-entry points ,  premises for the inspection of freight ,  premises for control of pedestrians ,  and barracks for the border guards and customs officials who serve at these control-and-check points . 
these new buildings will help to strengthen tajikistans capability to protect its borders while at the same time facilitating the procedure for private individuals crossing the border and the transit of freight between tajikistan and afghanistan . 
each year the united states provides more than <num>40</num>  $  million in assistance to tajikistan . 
the american embassy in dushanbe asserts that these funds promote a strengthening of tajikistans security ,  its economic development ,  and its democratic freedoms ,  and also improvements in the public health and education systems for the citizens of tajikistan . 
this assistance will ,  however ,  be increased in the near future as the united states is set to allocate additional funds for tajikistan to improve security . 
the asia plus agency reports that on august <num>22</num>  a signing ceremony took place in the republic of tajikistan foreign ministry for a document that effects the appropriate changes to the cooperation agreement between the governments of the united states and tajikistan in the sphere of security . 
the document was signed by the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ambassador to tajikistan ,  tracey ann jacobson and tajikistans foreign minister ,  khamrokhon zarifi . 
this agreement also envisages measures for fighting against illegal drugs trafficking and strengthening the functions of tajikistans law enforcement bodies . 
the head of the french defence department stated that this step is a gesture of recognition by her government of tajikistans participation in the anti-terrorist operation in afghanistan ,  particularly its hosting of a <num>250</num> -strong french air force contingent with a number of french warplanes ,  at dushanbes civilian airport . 
an auxiliary contingent of <num>250</num>  personnel of the french air force has been in dushanbe since december <num>2001</num>  to provide services for the french servicemen which make up part of the isaf . 
in addition ,  two french mirage fighter planes and two military transports are deployed at dushanbe airport . 
tajik authorities create incentives for grain import
he said this measure was taken to provide incentives for the import of grain and to ensure tajikistans food security . 
furthermore ,  bobozoda said ,  this step will help curb the rise in prices for flour and bread in the republic . 
i can say with certainty today that the price for flour has stabilised and the jumps in flour prices we saw last year are not expected ,  the minister said . 
the tajik population uses more than <num>1.2</num>  million metric tons of grain a year . 
domestic production covers only about <num>45</num>  - <num>50</num>  percent of that demand . 
according to galla ,  the state unitary enterprise which oversees grain imports ,  tajikistan imported <num>283,000</num>  metric tons of wheat and <num>511,000</num>  tons of flour in <num>2007</num>  , which was up <num>20</num>  percent from <num>2006</num>  .
flour and wheat imports are also expected to grow <num>15</num>  - <num>20</num>  percent this year . 
this past spring the international grains council forecast that tajikistan might be the worlds fourth largest flour importer in <num>2008</num>  .
kazakhstan is the main supplier of grain and flour to tajikistan ,  providing <num>95</num>  percent of imported flour and wheat for the republic . 
earthquake in uzbekistan
at <num>1</num>  : <num>26</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr>  on august <num>22</num>  , residents of tashkent felt the earth move under their feet . 
the earthquake ,  based on initial reports of the national seismographic station ,  rated a <num>6</num>  on the richter scale . 
 "  based on the earthquake's force ,  the station's seismologists assumed that its epicentre was located right in tashkent . 
 " presumably this is a local seismologic event ,  but exact information will be available only in an hour ,  "  the scientists explained . 
according to ca-news' tashkent correspondent ,  the city's residents went through a few white-knuckled moments . 
according to another tashkent local ,  the employee of a computer centre in one of the capital's firms ,  the earthquake caused several monitors to fly off the tables . 
weak tremors were felt as far away as neighbouring kazakhstan . 
shymkent saw minor soil disturbances ,  kazakhstan today news agency reported from sources in the shymkent seismographic station . 
based on current information ,  there appear to be no victims of the earthquake in uzbekistan . 
an ancient village nestles in the mountains of the wama district of the remote nuristan province in eastern afghanistan . 
remote and beautiful ,  nuristan has soaring peaks and thick coniferous forests unlike anywhere else in afghanistan . 
but years of unchecked logging have robbed the province of its key natural resource . 
were trying to turn the tide and bring resources back to the people of afghanistan . 
perez commands the provincial reconstruction team  ( prt )  in nuristan that is funding the project . 
the prt works closely with local officials there . 
this is a very important project for the nuristani people ,  and also for the government of nuristan ,  said mohammed ali ,  governor of nurgram district ,  where the project will be headquartered . 
it will definitely have a positive impact on employment ,  the environment ,  and security in general in nuristan . 
the nuristan conservation corps ,  or ncc ,  will employ <num>90</num>  nuristani youth to work on projects that improve their communities . 
modeled on the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  civilian conservation corps of the <num>1930</num>  second  and <num>1940</num>  second  ,  the ncc aims to provide training ,  employment ,  and a sense of public service to youth through public works . 
projects may include planting trees ,  building roads and pathways and other community infrastructure . 
by <num>2002</num>  , nuristan had lost more than <num>50</num>  percent of its forests . 
the first phase of the project involves planting <num>100,000</num>  trees in nurgram district . 
but for the prt ,  the process of bringing communities together is just as important as the result . 
afghanistans ministry of agriculture ,  irrigation and livestock in kabul pledged full support to the project ,  even promising to hire the labourers when the project ends . 
engineer mohammed hashim barakzai ,  director of natural resources at the ministry ,  called the project a model to replicate . 
this will be a very good initiative and a very good system ,  he said . 
the ministry has a plan to start this system all over afghanistan . 
we have very good experts in resource management ,  and we are ready to help with any technical support or expertise . 
engineer hazrat hussein khaurin is director general of forestry at the ministry ,  and describes the damage deforestation has caused . 
half of our forests are finished ,  he said . 
in nuristan ,  there are so many people who are sitting out in the sun in the winter time ,  just to warm themselves ,  because there is no wood . 
this project will be life supporting for people . 
there are going to be challenges . 
we all know nuristans remote location ,  and security situation . 
but with all groups working together - community ,  government ,  ngo ,  and prt - well deal with it . 
we need creative initiatives like these to impact security in afghanistan . 
the project is expected to begin in the autumn ,  at a cost of <num>675,000</num>  $   [ usd ]  . 
you look at all the projects being put into afghanistan today ,  the return that were going to get for this investment is exceptionally huge ,  said commander perez . 
pakistan blames al-qaeda for weekend hotel bombing
pakistan blamed al-qaeda-linked taliban militants for a massive suicide truck bombing at the marriott hotel that killed at least <num>60</num>  and injured more than <num>260</num>  on <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
malik said officials have made no arrests ,  but suspect the perpetrators are linked to previous attacks . 
but previous investigations ,  all the roads have gone to south waziristan .  " 
officials said <num>21</num>  foreigners were killed in the blast including ambassador ivo zdarek of the czech republic . 
the top official in the interior ministry said the government plans to continue its plan for combating militancy in the tribal regions by distributing development aid ,  negotiating peace deals with willing partners ,  and using military strikes when necessary . 
a crystal award for a doctor from turkmenistan
as is known ,  there are three major fatal ailments in the world against which medicine is still progressing - cancer ,  diabetes ,  and aids . 
whoever finds a cure for any of these ailments is guaranteed a nobel prize . 
curiosity ,  power of observation ,  inquisitiveness and the desire to help people are the chief qualities that distinguish this doctor in his daily medical practice . 
while treating his patients the director of endoscopy began to notice common patterns ,  similar or conversely atypical characteristics in the course of diseases of the oesophagus and stomach . 
he began collecting and analysing these data . 
professor meinhard classen of the university of munich ,  who headed the world gastroenterology organisation for many years ,  became interested in his research . 
german doctors are among the leaders in the research of gastroenterological diseases . 
they invited their young colleague from turkmenistan to join the organisation which is dedicated to maintaining professional contacts and expanding cooperation . 
after returning to ashgabat he continued his clinical observations and discussed the results of his research to prevent cancer of the esophagus with his colleagues from the organisation ,  and in medical journals . 
as he studied the risk factors for so-called reflux disease ,  ponyatov devised a table his colleagues call the ponyatov form . 
it was for this discovery ,  as well as new approaches to preventing cancer of the oesophagus ,  that he received the annual cook medical don wilson award which he shared with his canadian colleague yelena dubchenko . 
during his free time ponyatov enjoys surfing and diving . 
he said in an interview that he took great delight in swimming in the pacific ocean . 
as was reported in an american newspaper ,  he later demonstrated heroism in this area . 
once while surfing he spotted a drowning girl about <num>12</num>  or <num>13</num>  years old . 
her sister ran helplessly along the shore gesturing to ponyatov . 
he quickly realised what the trouble was and wasting no time rushed to save the victim . 
the rescued girl reported the incident to the local newspaper in la jolla ,  california ,  which published an article about the heroic act of a citizen of turkmenistan . 
when the material was ready for publication ,  a report was published on the internet that an article by ponyatov on diseases of the oesophagus would be published in the july issue of the popular international medical journal signea news . 
difficulties of doing business in tajikistan
presentation of world bank report  ( video-conference )  . 
as nataliya ryashentseva ,  a pragma corporation project specialist on improving the business environment in tajikistan ,  informed the prima-news information agency ,  the law provides for more than <num>190</num>  days to issue permits for construction . 
the most time is spent obtaining permits for the granting of land plots which are issued by the executive body of the local government . 
the situation as it stands today is that no foreign investor will begin construction in tajikistan before reaching a preliminary agreement with the government . 
without such an agreement not one major investor will risk entering the tajik market because the process of preparation is very lengthy ,  says ryashentseva . 
ifc experts note that the system of issuing permits to do business is too complicated in tajikistan . 
for example ,  a permit is required for the coordination of routes to transport and herd animals ,  for printing copies of accounting blank sheets and forms ,  and for distributing advertisements on postal envelopes . 
according to our project assessments ,  the government spends <num>7.5</num>  million somoni a year to issue permits ,  at a time when the state budget receives only <num>5.9</num>  million somoni a year from issuing the permits . 
in other words ,  there exists a negative balance in the current system of permits ,  stresses nurmatova . 
according to the chairman of the tajikistan small and medium size business association ,  matlyuba uldzhabayeva ,  business activity must be assertive in nature . 
 " unfortunately ,  our business activity is more about obtaining permits than moving forward . 
the businessman has not yet started his activity but he already has to collect a large number of permits in order to begin . 
such a system only leads to an increase in corruption . 
all ministries are involved in issuing permits . 
why ? 
in order to monitor the pulse of business life so that in the future they can impede the businessman with their regulations and inspections rather than facilitating his activities ,  "  notes uldzhabayeva . 
kunar woman is number <num>1</num>  in university class
ghotai would stand out anywhere ,  but in a country where less than <num>20</num>  percent of women can read and write ,  she is exceptional . 
she is first in her class at kabul university this year - a highly competitive position . 
my family always supported my studying and learning ,  she says . 
and my teachers and classmates encouraged me to achieve something and to think about the future . 
but ghotai knew exactly where she was going . 
she specialises in the pashto language ,  her native tongue ,  but also speaks fluent dari and english .

this is because people dont know better ,  ghotai says . 
the main reason girls cant go to school is because their families prevent them . 
in kunar ,  people are very poor and very religious . 
the jihad started there . 
we have war and cultural restrictions . 
if families knew the benefits of knowledge ,  they would encourage their daughters to study . 
id go back to kunar if there was a university there ,  says ghotai . 
we need to have facilities for girls . 
she will return home if she can ,  she says . 
i would like to go back to kunar as a teacher . 
i want to teach ,  and to help my people . 
there are so few women who are able to achieve something ,  she says . 
she sits up straight . 
i would like to be a hero . 
i want to be a hero for the kunar people .

authorities allowed some reporters to take part in the discussions ,  but they did not invite journalists-foreign or uzbek-to report on the conference . 
previously postponed twice by uzbek authorities ,  the conference did ,  nevertheless ,  involve some of president islam karimovs harshest critics ,  including officials from the international crisis group  ( icg )  ,  human rights watch ,  and amnesty international . 
the event ,  titled liberalisation of mass media got underway just as the eu was preparing to review its currently suspended visa ban and arms embargo on uzbekistan . 
the sanctions were imposed following the bloody crackdown against anti-government protesters in andijon in may <num>2005</num>  .
according to elsa vidal of reporters without borders ,  the decision to restrict press coverage undermined the purpose of the conference .

pakistan reacts to credit crisis
national bank of pakistan logo . 
 ( ipd ) 
south korea and pakistan were once predicted to be the fastest growing economies in asia . 
many believe that the right fiscal policies will help pakistan prosper . 
many countries in the world have seen debacles in their credit markets exacerbated by events in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and european credit markets . 
while billions of dollars have suddenly been removed from the credit system ,  ahmed says emerging markets are more fortunate because they have less credit in their system and will suffer slightly less . 
access to credit is generally good but you can have too much of a good thing . 
you cannot give credit to people that do not deserve it because of misuse ,  he said . 
earthquake destroys village of nura
<num>5</num>  , panic erupted when powerful jolts began at <num>10</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr>  within half an hour ,  powerful tremors razed the mountain village of nura to the ground . 
according to figures released by the kyrgyz ministry of health ,  <num>41</num>  children of school and pre-school age died in the tragedy . 
most of the victims of the tragedy were children ,  who are being buried close to their homes  ( official photo ) 
thirty-eight of the surviving villagers have been evacuated to safety ,  but according to officials from the kyrgyz government ,  search and rescue efforts are being hampered by the fact that the worst-affected settlements are situated in remote areas well away from roads . 
a total of <num>128</num>  dwellings within the quake zone have been completely destroyed . 
in all there were around <num>100</num>  tremors ,  more than <num>15</num>  of which were of a magnitude between <num>3</num>  and <num>4</num>   [ on the richter scale ]  . 
the institute had previously forecasted that a series of quakes  [ like this one ]  would occur . 
kazakh grain harvest good despite droughts
we should note ,  however ,  that <num>80</num>  percent of the countrys wheat is cultivated in kostanay and akmola regions in the north ,  which did not experience droughts ,  he said . 
kazakhstans southern ,  south-eastern and eastern regions had record-low harvests this year due to severe droughts ,  but their outputs arent significant nationally . 
in an effort to prevent bread shortages ,  the kazakh government established grain stabilisation funds after last april ,  when it was forced to ban grain exports until a new harvest . 
new legislation will require farmers to sell grain to the government at market prices even when low quantities threaten the countrys food security . 
to prevent grain price increases under such circumstances ,  they will face fines and lose subsidies . 
statistics on stocks of grain elevators and agricultural producers will also be double-checked by special inspectors to avoid fraud . 
afghans call for joint counterterrorism unit
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak addresses parliament in kabul on april <num>29</num>  .
wardak said in late september that he wanted afghans ,  pakistanis and foreign troops to form a joint counterterrorism unit that would have the authority to pursue terrorists across the border between pakistan and afghanistan . 
a terrorist recognises no boundaries ,  so ,  to fight them ,  i think we have to eventually come up with some arrangement ,  together with our neighbour pakistan ,  for a joint task force consisting of a coalition of afghan and pakistani troops ,  wardak said . 
this would allow us to operate on both sides of the border . 
he said the idea was discussed about a month and a half ago at a tripartite commission meeting . 
the commission represents the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  pakistan and afghanistan . 
afghan officials have accused pakistan of failing to clamp down on militancy in tribal areas along the afghan border from which militants have launched attacks into afghanistan . 
the pakistani armys recent operations in the bajaur tribal agency ,  however ,  have helped reduce violence on the afghan side of the border wardak said in early october .

apprentice banned in afghanistan
ludmillah khamosh ,  news presenter at tolo tv
an afghan tv station is advertising for contestants to take part in a local version of the apprentice - despite government threats to shut them down for showing foreign programmes . 
the countrys most popular channel is trawling afghanistan for aspiring entrepreneurs ,  amid an ongoing row between the media and the countrys mullahs over broadcasting indian soap operas . 
the countrys president ,  hamid karzai ,  has sided with the ultra-conservative clerics insisting there are too many foreign shows on air . 
but tolo tv ,  which brought afghanistan its own version of pop idol ,  has thrice defied a ban on broadcasting bollywood serials . 
the government is recovering from the shock of previous regimes and still has substantial capacity limitations ,  said tolo director jahid mohseni . 
producers are using the same crew who made afghan star ,  the wildly popular pop idol knock-off ,  and they have been showing them clips of apprentice and dragons' den ,  to get them thinking about business instead of pop . 
mohseni insisted fekir talosh was designed to use television - which was banned under the taliban - to teach people about business . 
he said :   " if we can get one idea that is fantastic ,  if we can get a dozen new entrepreneurs that is even better .  " 
versions of dragons' den have aired in at least ten countries already including britain ,  america ,  japan and lebanon . 
farmers enjoy success brought by new plant
nestle has established pakistans largest milk collection facilities  ( photo ipd ) 
nestle has invested in pakistan over the past <num>19</num>  years and has established the countrys largest milk collection facilities . 
in addition to working with local farmers ,  the company has more than <num>2,000</num>  employees in the country . 
a network of collection centres have helped ensure that farmers do not need to go far to deliver their daily output . 
the milk collection system has created hundreds of jobs and has generated a communications and transport network as well . 
the factories in sheikhupura and kabirwala have advanced chilling systems in place which prevents the milk from spoiling . 
a nestle technical assistance team trains the more than <num>900,000</num>  farmers in pakistan who supply milk to nestle in modern techniques and updates them on the latest advancements in dairy production . 
nestle has contributed significantly to pakistan becoming the worlds fourth largest milk producer and the second largest in asia behind india . 
gas and light for water
in exchange ,  kyrgyzstan is obliged to release the necessary amount of water from the toktogulk reservoir for irrigation of its neighbours fields . 
the amount of water should be <num>5.25</num>  billion cubic metres . 
the government of the republic also guarantees that the amount of water in the toktogulk at the start of the growing season will not drop below a level set in <num>2008</num>  .
then uzbekistan announced that it would sell kyrgyzstan gas at world prices :  <num>300</num>  $   [ usd ]  per thousand cubic metres . 
kyrgyzstan is in no condition to buy the blue fuel at that price . 
at the same time ,  the kyrgyz side announced it was ready to hold gas supply talks with turkmenistan . 
however ,  the turkmens refused to extend an additional branch of the gas pipeline bypassing uzbekistan . 
danduna community creates dairy farm
we are selling our products at the green hotel ,  said mohammed seddiq ,  head of the community development council  ( cdc )  in danduna . 
this project will be a success when you run it all on your own ,  cdc project monitor fazl hakim told the community . 
the community has contributed significantly to the project . 
income from the dairy is already enough to cover its expenses . 
the cdc members take the milk ,  cheese ,  and yogurt produced on the farm to asadabad ,  not far from their village ,  and say they have no trouble selling everything they produce . 
there is not just a market for these things ,  hakim says . 
theres a real need . 
cdcs are engaged in thousands of similar small projects throughout kunar ,  working to bring positive change to communities . 
it depends on the cdc and the people of the community ,  says hakim . 
if they are smart and hard working ,  they can achieve many good things .

 [ daily times pakistan ,  pakistan observer ,  a pakistan news ] 
thus far the global financial crisis has not affected uzbekistan ,  but the views of economists vary on whether the countrys economic stability can be sustained over the near future . 
for instance ,  a group of analysts known as the uzbekistan rapid response group recently issued a report stating that the global crisis is certain to hit the uzbek economy . 
according to the report ,  there are a number of dangers in store for uzbekistan including ,  first and foremost ,  lower incomes earned by migrant workers ,  which will in turn lower remittances to uzbekistan and lead to a fall in exchange rates . 
there are currently up to <num>5</num>  million migrant workers outside uzbekistan who transfer large amounts of money to their homeland . 
in addition ,  there are prospects for sharp rises in the prices of all consumer goods and services ,  lower bank investment due to the financial crisis ,  and a partial or total breakdown of bilateral economic arrangements . 
kalnur ormushev asserts that the global economic crisis poses no dangers for uzbekistan :  the crisis has hit countries whose economies are based solely on the acquisition of extractable resources . 
the structure of uzbekistans economy is such that there are a wide number of sectors in which the full production cycles are domestic ,  and this will probably save the country from the effects of the crisis . 
tajik pilgrims visit sacred muslim sites

 ( photo by nigina sharipova ) 
dushanbe - the first two groups of <num>360</num>  tajik pilgrims making the hajj flew to mecca from dushanbe on november <num>17</num>  , said abdusalom radzhabov ,  director of the hajj department in the religious affairs division of the ministry of culture . 
people older than <num>80</num>  and those with health problems must have escorts . 
this is because many people with chronic illnesses die each year during the hajj . 
radzhabov noted that pilgrims who have already visited mecca are not eligible to visit again for five years . 
muslims who have completed the hajj are considered by other devotees to be closer to allah . 
but hajj pilgrims are not always motivated by religious beliefs alone . 
tajik president rakhmon reportedly claimed last year that some muslims make the pilgrimage to the islamic holy places repeatedly for show . 
he said the costs associated with a second hajj could be better spent on improving family life ,  educating children and grandchildren ,  improving the country ,  and helping the needy . 
tajikistans population to increase until <num>2050</num> 
dushanbe - the population of tajikistan will increase by more than <num>50</num>  percent to reach <num>10.8</num>  million people by <num>2050</num>  , compared with <num>6.8</num>  million at present ,  forecasts a un population fund report on global demographics . 
the funds experts anticipate that ,  among the commonwealth of independent states  ( cis )  ,  tajikistan will continue to have the highest population growth rate ,  which currently stands at <num>1.5</num>  percent per year . 
pakistani foreign direct investment declines by <num>44</num>  % 
islamabad - pakistans domestic challenges are turning investors off ,  analysts say - and it may be a while before things improve . 
no one comes to invest in a country like pakistan confronted with a debt trap and a growing fiscal deficit ,  prime minister economic advisory committee  ( eac )  and former advisor to the finance ministry dr ashfaq hasan khan said . 
if you look at developments of the past two years ,  in pakistans case its debt has gone up to <num>60</num>  %  of gdp and  ( it has a )  growing fiscal deficit . 
pakistans foreign direct investment  ( fdi )  dropped by <num>44.7</num>  %  in the first ten months of fiscal year <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  , compared with a year earlier ,  according to an official document of the board of investment  ( boi )  ,  a division responsible for promoting investment in pakistan . 
the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  has released fdi for july-april  ( <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  )  indicating <num>1.772</num>  $  billion against <num>3.20</num>  $  billion for the corresponding period of the last fiscal year ,  the document says . 
the document indicates that pakistan secured <num>3.52</num>  $  billion in fdi in <num>2005</num> -<num>2006</num>  .
fdi grew to <num>5.14</num>  $  billion in <num>2006</num> -<num>2007</num>  , then <num>5.41</num>  $  billion in <num>2007</num> -<num>2008</num>  .
however ,  with the decline in economic growth and the prevalence of terrorism ,  its fdi level dropped to <num>3.72</num>  $  billion in <num>2008</num> -<num>2009</num>  .
as terror attacks intensified ,  investment continued to shrink ,  dropping to <num>1.72</num>  $  billion in <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  .
the united states was the top investor with <num>2010</num>  . . 
the oil and gas sector attracted the most investment ,  <num>2010</num>  . . 
other industries receiving significant foreign support include telecommunications ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  finance ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  transportation ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  paper and pulp ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  construction ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  chemicals ,  <num>2010</num>  . ;  and others ,  <num>2010</num>  . . 
khan blamed the fdi drop on bad planning and government policies . 
he also said the worsening security problem has scared away investors . 
fdi cannot be encouraged in a worsening law-and-order situation ,  ashfaq said . 
salim mandiwala ,  head of boi ,  blames the global economic crisis ,  terrorism and the energy crisis in pakistan for the drop in fdi . 
but at the same time ,  when other countries also witnessed negative fdi in <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  , pakistans total of around <num>2</num>  $  billion was not a bad performance ,  mandiwala said . 
the situation wont improve until the government remedies the security and energy crises ,  said dr abid suleri ,  executive director of the sustainable development policy institute . 
its hard to lure investment unless and until investors are given lucrative incentives for preferring pakistan over other countries ,  suleri said . 
suleri does not agree with government officials that law and order will improve drastically in coming years ,  helping pakistan to secure fdi . 
i dont see any major development in coming years as far as fdi in pakistan is concerned ,  as there is no considerable change in law and order andthe energy sector expected in the near future ,  he said . 
because of the nature of the border ,  because of the nature of geography ,  history and culture ,  there is no force that can physically block that border ,  di paola said . 
the border cannot be sealed . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  you need the understanding of the people living there to separate themselves from the bad guys ,  from the terrorists . 
you can achieve this only by working with the people of the tribal areas . 
in recent months ,  pro-taliban guerrillas have ambushed a number of convoys moving through the khyber pass at the pakistan-afghanistan border . 
di paola said that nato was seeking to set up alternate supply routes for its <num>54,000</num> -strong international security assistance force  ( isaf )  in afghanistan . 
in april ,  russia offered the use of its national rail network to transport military supplies to the nato-led force via the so-called northern route . 
di paola said the alliance was already using russian air space for this purpose ,  but that it had not yet reached agreement with all the central asian nations bordering afghanistan on the north to allow the military trains to make their way from russia to the afghan border . 
it makes good sense to have more than a single line of logistic support ,  he concluded . 
tajikistan plans to produce all the bread it needs
tajikistan intends to increase grain production to <num>1.2</num>  million tons by <num>2015</num>  .

tajik economists also propose decreasing taxes and customs duties on imported flour and wheat ,  which since the beginning of the year cost <num>124.6</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  and <num>42.4</num>  $  million respectively . 
further development of animal and plant husbandry is also part of tajikistans food security programme . 
economists believe that the government should decrease the area sown to cotton ,  now <num>257.3</num>  thousand hectares ,  by half since its cultivation has ceased to be profitable . 
the cultivation of grain is cheaper for farmers and is profitable . 
with tajikistans population ,  now at <num>7.2</num>  million ,  continuing to grow ,  demand for food products will also grow ,  which is the key factor in shaping the nations agriculture policies . 
two new historical films released in kazakhstan
 ( photo by steve granitz / wireimage ) 
in mid-november ,  astana's moviegoers were provided a rare treat with the release of two kazakh films that tackle the country's turbulent history . 
slambek taukel's makhambet was shown only in a limited pre-release run ,  while satybalda narymbetov's mustafa shokay ,  in production for five years ,  had a broader release . 
the films address similar themes and periods and portray kazakh figures who struggled for independence against russia in the 19t and 20t centuries . 
the kazakh poet and national figure olzhas suleymenov penned the screenplay for makhambet . 
mustafa shokay is a bio-drama that charts the tragic fate of one man caught up by the implacable forces of history . 
a well-known figure at the time of the russian revolution ,  shokay  ( also known as chokayev )  first agitated for autonomy and later the independence of turkistan ,  which in his view encompassed all central asian republics . 
after the bolsheviks solidified their hold on power ,  shokay emigrated to paris where he worked on anti-soviet propaganda . 
when hitler invaded france shokay was taken to germany and instructed to form fighting brigades for the nazis with turkistani prisoners freed from soviet camps . 
the film's screenplay was written by famous kazakh playwright akim tarazi ,  screenwriter yermek tursunov and russian filmmaker sergey bodrov ,  sr . 
the film stars kyrgyz actor aziz beyshenaliyev and kazakh singer karina abdullina . 
an artist ,  tutor and organiser
ashgabat - on november <num>21</num>  an exhibition of paintings by students  ( ana bayramgeldyeva and karina kayrapetyan )  of the artist gulnazar bekmuradov opened at the begler studio in ashgabat . 
gulnazar bekmuradov has become a household name in turkmenistan . 
with the acquisition of some of his paintings by foreign museums he has also become known internationally as well . 
upon retiring he opened a private studio to nurture artistic talent . 
i have a few pupils ,  says the artist . 
during the first year i had a class of three students who are now studying at universities in moscow and the ukraine . 
this year i have just two students . 
the important thing is for them to retain their passion for painting and beauty their whole lives long . 
im <num>74</num>  , but i still love to pick up a brush and paint ,  he said . 
kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan beset by energy woes
swift action is being taken in uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan to overcome an energy crisis . 
unusual steps such as switching off lighting in civil servants offices are being taken . 
in neighbouring uzbekistan ,  the supply of electricity to homes is being cut off at certain planned times as part of an economy drive . 
the state committee for deregulation ,  competition and enterprise says that power cuts last up to <num>11</num>  hours a day in some provinces .

 ( reuters / jayanta shaw ) 
the announcement blaming militant group lashkar-e-taiba threatened to escalate tensions between india and pakistan . 
however ,  indian officials have been cautious about accusing pakistan's government of complicity . 
foreign ministry spokesman vishnu prakash denied a news report that india was preparing to end a <num>2003</num>  cease-fire with pakistan . 
an intelligence official said there was no unusual mobilisation of troops along the india-pakistan border . 
prime minister manmohan singh promised to strengthen maritime and air security and look into creating a new federal investigative agency . 
in the first wave of the attacks ,  two young gunmen armed with assault rifles blithely ignored more than <num>60</num>  police officers patrolling the city's main train station and sprayed bullets into the crowd . 
assistant commissioner of the mumbai railway police bapu thombre said the police were armed mainly with batons or antiquated rifles . 
that gave the gunmen time to consolidate control over two luxury hotels and the jewish centre . 
singh promised to expand the commando force and set up new bases for it around the country . 
he called a rare meeting of leaders from the country's main political parties ,  hours after the resignation of home minister shivraj patil . 
among the <num>19</num>  foreigners killed were americans ,  germans ,  canadians ,  israelis and nationals from britain ,  italy ,  japan ,  china ,  thailand ,  australia ,  singapore and mexico .

 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ,  kazakhstan ) 
astana - implementation of the nurly kosh  ( bright settlement )  project ,  which is part of a government migration management programme ,  will begin in kazakhstan in <num>2009</num>  .
its objective is the efficient voluntary resettlement of nationals who have returned to the country from abroad and kazakhstan citizens who are living in depressed regions of the country . 
according to the world kazakh association ,  their returns to kazakhstan began in <num>1991</num>  and <num>686,000</num>  have returned thus far . 
since independence ,  kazakhstan has been searching for optimal ways to help them adapt to their homeland . 
while some of those efforts have been positive ,  returnees still face a number of problems . 
according to the ministry of labour and social protection ,  which drafted the legislation ,  currently those areas can employ about <num>390,000</num>  people . 
with this in mind ,  the ministry plans to build <num>28</num>  compact settlements with accommodations for at least <num>1,000</num>  families each . 
returness who participate in nurly kosh and their family members will have the right to receive social assistance ,  primarily in the form of low mortgage interest rates for purchasing residences . 
according to minister of labour and social protection of the population berdibek saparbayev ,  nurly kosh will promote the efficient distribution of the labour force where needed in the country and provide a direct economic stimulus for returnees . 
first national film festival held in uzbekistan
the festival screened <num>19</num>  films made in uzbekistan over two days .

uzbek cinema is now <num>80</num>  years old ;  its time to take stock ,  said mahmudov in characterising the idea behind the festival . 
the swiss office for cooperation with central asian countries ,  the public foundation forum for uzbek culture and arts and uzbekkino ,  a national film agency ,  sponsored the festival . 
tajikistan gets tough on violence against women
since violence against women is not only an infringement of human rights ,  but also a crime . 
analysis has shown that violence against women is regarded as an acceptable form of behaviour by <num>30</num>  percent of single men <num>30</num>  years old or younger ,  <num>29</num>  percent of married men <num>30</num>  or younger and <num>20</num>  percent of married men over <num>30</num>  .
it is worrying that a large segment of young men still adhere to these outdated feudalistic views . 
after the explosion ,  <num>60</num>  square metres were engulfed in flame .

the blast occurred at <num>13</num>  : <num>20</num>  local time ,  during lunch breaks in the surrounding offices . 
after the explosion ,  <num>60</num>  square metres were engulfed in flame . 
a <num>22</num> -year-old woman died on the scene and another died in hospital . 
the fire was extinguished after two and a half hours ,  during which time one of the liveliest streets in almaty was closed and residents were evacuated from surrounding buildings . 
a commission has been formed to investigate the cause of the explosion . 
it is known that gas from <num>50</num> -litre gas tanks in the basement of the cafe detonated ,  but according to emergency situations department director damir khalikov the tanks themselves did not explode . 
it could be that someone purposely caused the explosion by turning on the gas . 
the investigation will answer that question ,  he said . 
vladimir semyonov ,  the assistant chief doctor of the city hospital where victims of the fire were taken ,  said that three were in critical condition . 
they have burns over <num>70</num> -<num>95</num>  percent of their bodies . 
in uzbekistan ,  the millionth passenger vehicle was produced
tashkent - the millionth car rolled off the assembly line of the uzbek joint enterprise gm uzbekistan factory at the end of november . 
it was the chevrolet lacetti - the factorys new series model . 
most of these cars will be sold on the domestic market and only a small number of them will be exported . 
in uzbekistan the price of a lacetti will be about <num>27,000</num>  $   [ usd ]  . 
doha- in a speech at the international conference on financing for development convened at the end of november in doha  ( qatar )  by the un ,  imf ,  who and world bank ,  tajik president emomali rahmon called on the international community to offer greater assistance to the poorest of the central asian republics . 
rahmon cited lower export revenues resulting from falls of up to <num>50</num>  percent in the prices of raw materials as having had an adverse effect on tajikistan and other central asian nations . 
without cooperation and assistance from the international community and unless additional finance is ploughed into its economy ,  tajikistan is set to go through hard times ,  the tajik president told his counterparts from other countries . 
he also reiterated his invitation to investors to contribute to the rogun hydroelectric power plant construction project . 
it will enable us to export more than <num>30</num>  billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to pakistan ,  afghanistan ,  iran ,  india and other countries . 
exports of electricity to our neighbour afghanistan will be a major contribution to the stabilising its economy ,  rahmon said . 
dushanbe is seeking investors to provide between us <num>1.3</num>  $  and <num>3.2</num>  billion depending on how many generating units come on stream to complete the rogun plant ,  the largest of its kind in central asia . 
the international community has regularly given dushanbe financial assistance to rebuild its economy and infrastructures destroyed in the civil war of the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  and guard its lengthy border with afghanistan ,  the main route used to export afghan drugs to europe . 
in september ,  the un also called on donor nations to increase their aid to tajikistan to help tackle food shortages . 
the remittances of nearly one million tajiks who work in russia were <num>2</num>  $  billion in the first nine months of this year . 
the decline in construction jobs in russia due to the global economic crisis ,  however ,  will reduce that amount significantly . 
against this background it is interesting to note that the countrys annual state budget barely exceeds <num>600</num>  $  million . 
uzbekistan releases report on environment
aral sea . 
tashkent - in early december ,  uzbekistans hydrometeorological centre issued a report on meeting the obligations stipulated by the un framework convention on climate change which will be presented at the 14t conference of framework convention members in poznan ,  poland . 
the report states that over the past <num>10</num>  years the greenhouse effect has caused a warming in central asia of <num>0.29</num>  degrees celsius ,  compared with a global average of <num>0.13</num>  degrees . 
this has resulted in a drought in northern uzbekistan ,  increased water loss in irrigation ,  and a drinking water shortage . 
dust from the floor of the dried up aral sea has been discovered in the atmosphere over greenland ,  which intensifies the greenhouse effect . 
in our country <num>28</num>  million tonnes of carbon are released into the atmosphere each year owing to fuel use and three million tonnes are released from leaks during gas transport ,  said head of the agrarian ,  water ,  and environmental committee in parliament senator gafur aliyev . 
oil and gas fields ,  refineries ,  chemical plants ,  power plants ,  and homes are the main sources of methane emissions in uzbekistan . 
the government has approved <num>55</num>  projects related to controlling emissions . 
equipment has already been installed at maksam-chirchik ,  central asias largest chemical plant ,  to trap emissions of toxic nitrous oxide . 
a similar unit is being installed at the navoi chemical plant . 
the opportunities to reduce emissions are greatest in the energy industry . 
the energy intensity of uzbekistans gdp is double the world average with energy use by the uzbek housing sector three to four times greater than in developed countries . 
pilgrims return home

uzbekistan pins hopes on exports
support will be provided to export companies in the form of low interest loans ,  tax concessions and the restructuring of existing debts . 
loans will be offered at rates around one-third lower than the central banks base rate of <num>14</num>  percent . 
there are also plans to restrict rises in the prices export companies pay for of all sources of energy and utilities next year . 
the government plans to cut industrial production costs next year by at least <num>20</num>  percent by streamlining technological processes ,  reducing energy use in production and improving cash flow management . 
the governments programme will also offer assistance to small businesses in the form of loans and tax concessions . 
the usaid project will provide small farmers with mini-processing plants to eliminate such losses in the future and increase exports .

afghan elder recalls countrys history
senior citizens in afghanistan
some estimate he is between <num>120</num>  and <num>125</num>  years old . 
but what is for certain is shapoor ,  who goes by just one name ,  is one of the oldest men in afghanistan . 
his fondest memories are of the post-war period under king amanullah khan . 
the king liberated women and marked the beginning of a new era by allowing his wife to appear next to him in public during a ceremony in paghman district ,  recalls shapoor . 
i took up work in the brick-burning factory until the germans arrived here and built a textile factory where i worked as a machinist . 
but when they lost world war ii ,  they left and handed over the factory to afghan owners ,  he says . 
shapoor lived with his wife ,  daughters ,  mother ,  uncle ,  sister and brother . 
he wanted to educate himself ,  but never had the opportunity as the main breadwinner of the family . 
but he insisted on sending his sister to school in spite of protests from other family members who were opposed to idea . 
she was able to go due to the fact that she was educated and could make a new life for herself in another country ,  he says proudly . 
shapoor recalls that when the russians invaded and the soviet-backed noor muhammad taraki took over the presidency people were scared . 
there were rumours that people who worked for the previous government would be killed . 
during this period ,  tragedy hit after shapoors wife and two daughters passed away due to illnesses . 
shapoor chose not remarry since it was a turbulent time in the countrys history and he was forced to move around during periods of fighting . 
he lived through the russian occupation only to be put to the test again during the harsh taliban regime . 
during this time ,  he was able to hold on to his job as a security officer at the department of mines ,  and later as a director in the same department . 
now retired ,  he lives on the property of the current governor in baghlan looking after the grounds as the resident gardener . 
he can be seen wandering around tending to flowers and trees in peace reflecting upon the past and the present . 
everyone in my family lives a long life ,  i dont know why ,  we must have a special gene ,  he says with a smile . 
afghan mineral discoveries could transform national economy
kabul - afghanistans mineral deposits may be worth more than us <num>3</num>  $  trillion ,  according to the governments mining ministry - a figure that is triple previous estimates and that has generated hope for afghanistans economic future . 
the preliminary information that we have is about a big vein of iron ,  which starts from badakhshan province and goes to the border with iran ,  afghan mining minister waheedullah shahrani said at a june <num>17</num>  press conference . 
recent research has discovered huge veins of copper ,  iron ,  cobalt ,  gold and strategic metals like lithium . 
the government will prioritize iron and copper mining and hopes to include income from those deposits in its budget within five to seven years ,  afghan officials said . 
mining officials have voiced optimistic predictions that the newly discovered mineral wealth will transform some of the countrys poorest areas into its wealthiest . 
the mining ministry announced it has established an information centre to help prospective investors track progress on mining permits ,  deposit discoveries and other matters . 
the ministry has invited international firms to invest in mining and has predicted heavy investment to result from a conference scheduled for this week in london . 
hajigak mine ,  the biggest iron mine in the world ,  will be introduced to around <num>200</num>  investors ,  he said . 
we will provide them with all preliminary geological information . 
mohammad younas qanooni ,  speaker of the lower house ,  welcomed the revelations but criticised officials for not providing exact details . 
the lack of precision could foster corruption ,  he said . 
afghan president hamid karzai ,  who is travelling to japan ,  has courted mining investment worldwide but said that afghanistan would prefer investment from countries that have supported it in the past . 
ensuring security and having modern equipment ,  as well as effective consultation and training of afghan experts ,  are the needs of the hour ,  jawad omar ,  a mining ministry spokesman ,  told central asia online . 
kabul will ask the international community to help afghanistan mine those deposits ,  said aziz shams ,  a finance ministry spokesman . 
officials have expressed hope that international investment will help the state become self-sufficient ,  shams said . 
scholars said mining could invigorate the countrys feeble job market . 
serious problems stand in the way of longed-for prosperity ,  though . 
illegal mining ,  poor security and administration ,  and a lack of trained geologists will challenge the mining industry . 
just last year ,  then-mining minister mohammad ibrahim adel was accused of taking a us <num>200</num>  bribe to award china the rights to develop afghanistans copper mine . 
adel lost his job .

kyrgyzstan lays foundation for professional army
kyrgyzstan launches military reforms  ( photo by andrew caballero-reynolds / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - discussions of military reforms are the focus of attention in kyrgyz political circles after defence minister bakytbek kalyyev presented draft legislation on mandatory national service for kyrgyzstans citizens and military and alternative service to members of the parliament's largest party ,  the social democrats . 
among the bill's chief provisions is a proposal to create a national reserve force as an alternative to mandatory full-time military service . 
those unwilling to fulfil the two-year military service term can now pay <num>12,000</num>  som  ( around <num>300</num>  $  usd )  and undergo a month-long training session at a boot camp ,  after which they receive reservist status . 
that money will go into a fund that will finance training camps and discharge payments for full-time servicemen . 
these reforms are slated for implementation in three phases . 
the first phase is set for completion in june <num>2009</num>  , the second in december <num>2009</num>  and the third in <num>2012</num>  .
over this timeframe ,  five military commands will be reorganised into training centres and storage facilities . 
the defence ministry itself will be reorganised under the plan with the addition of a new military command ,  the mobile forces . 
kalyyev explains that these units will be on constant alert ,  ready to fulfil orders of the defence ministry at a moment's notice . 
the mobile forces will also incorporate a new structure ,  the centre for combating terrorism and armed groups . 
offsetting a loss of <num>600</num>  officer-level positions is a planned increase of <num>869</num>  professional soldiers in the country's military forces . 
their monthly salaries will be doubled to <num>8,000</num>  som  ( <num>200</num>  $  )  . 
the defence ministry plans to increase the proportion of professional soldiers to <num>80</num>  percent of the army by <num>2012</num>  , leaving the force with only <num>20</num>  percent conscripts . 
kyrgyzstan's military forces ,  including interior ministry troops and national security forces ,  currently number around <num>12,000</num>  .

the iron silk road
according to oksana filyuk ,  the press secretary for the state rail monopoly kyrgyz temir zholu ,  china opened a representative office of its railways ministry in bishkek in <num>2007</num>  to ensure the projects success . 
building the railway will create an estimated <num>50,000</num>  jobs in kyrgyzstan ,  and trade between kyrgyzstan and china ,  which in <num>2006</num>  totalled us$1 billion ,  will expand significantly . 
the project has its opponents . 
political analyst mars sariyev believes that ,  with china controlling the railway ,  the region will see an inflow of chinese immigrants eager to establish a presence in the area . 
kyrgyzstan could become a de-facto province of china in another <num>35</num>  to <num>50</num>  years ,  he contends . 
despite that sobering prediction ,  the kyrgyz leadership views the construction of the kashgar-osh-andijan rail line as vital to the countrys future economic development ,  providing one more step in the age-old quest to link east and west along the silk road .

institute director kanatbek abdrakhmanov notes that these predictions are made on the basis of the institute's research and computer modelling of tectonic processes . 
institute researchers claim that the current increase in seismic activity is evidence that kyrgyzstan has entered a new phase of tectonic shifts that are all too familiar to the region .

the ecological law was developed and adopted as part of the countrys national strategy to reduce poverty ,  which runs until <num>2011</num>  .
according to vladimir grebnev ,  the director of the un development programme in kyrgyzstan ,  all national laws and regulations governing ecological activity were adopted between <num>1997</num> -<num>1999</num>  and do not meet current needs . 
the new law should solve these problems ,  since its more concrete than the current legislation ,  said independent ecological analysis director oleg pecheniuk . 
ecologists believe that adopting the new law should improve financing for ecological activities . 
according to official figures ,  capital expenditures for environmental protection are currently <num>0.46</num>  percent of gdp . 
in fact only <num>15</num> -<num>30</num>  percent of that amount goes toward environmental activities ,  while the rest goes to administrative expenses .

festival of russian culture  ( photo by sebastian meyer / getty images ) 
according to crc chairperson svetlana gerasimova ,  the organisation has never been russian-only ,  but welcomes people of all backgrounds to join in its activities . 
the organisation's branch offices are working directly with local government bodies to assist in preserving and promoting the russian language . 
russian language instructor dildora muladzhanova believes that the crc and its branches are invaluable resources for students studying russian . 
uzbek schools devote only one hour per week to the russian language ,  an amount most parents find inadequate . 
in the soviet era ,  russian was taught five to six hours per week . 
the crc's activities are financed by the russian embassy in uzbekistan and the local office of a division of russia's ministry of foreign affairs charged with promoting russian language and culture abroad . 
the crc works in cooperation with the tashkent and central asian dioceses of the russian orthodox church and with various uzbek foundations ,  ngos ,  theatres ,  museums and other cultural institutions . 
kazakhstan liberalises laws
kazakhstan - kazakhstans parliament has amended laws on elections ,  mass media ,  political parties ,  and local governments . 
the changes to the law on political parties reduces the number of members a party must have to register with the justice ministry from <num>50,000</num>  to <num>40,000</num>  members ,  and extends the period following the founding meeting during which registration documents must be submitted from two months to four months . 
the amendments to the laws on mass media eliminate the requirement that media enterprises re-register if they replace their editor-in-chief or change their address ,  as well as the need to prove the reliability of the information . 
the law requires reporters to obtain consent to use audio and video recording equipment during interviews . 
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev asked the constitutional court to examine amendments to the law on freedom of religion and religious organisations to make sure they were constitutional ,  after religious groups and the public criticised the amendments as going against international standards . 
human rights activists believe the president consulted the constitutional court because he questioned the constitutionality of the law ,  not just as a formality .

iran claims first launch of its own satellite
<num>3</num>  , iran announced it sent its first domestically made satellite into orbit ,  a major step for an ambitious space programme that worries other world powers because the same technology can also deliver warheads . 
in a year in which ahmadinejad faces a tough election battle to stay in power ,  the launch provided a symbol of national pride in the face of a drop in oil prices that is lowering the hard-line leader's popularity . 
as it seeks to expand its influence in the middle east ,  iran touts such technological successes as signs it can advance despite <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and un sanctions over its nuclear programme . 
 "  [ the launch ]  underlines and illustrates our serious concerns about iran's intentions "  ,  said bill rammell ,  the uk minister responsible for the middle east ,  on <abbr>feb.</abbr>  <num>3</num>  .

at chon umtulu ,  an ngo dedicated to the health needs of disabled children ,  specialists point out that price increases could also cause a corresponding jump in counterfeit medications ,  which already account for <num>70</num>  percent of the total according to world health organisation estimates . 
especially worrisome is the finding that only <num>24</num>  percent of antibiotics sold on the market meet quality standards .

maliki's party gains victory in iraqi provincial elections
the results ,  which still must be verified by international and national observers in a process expected to take weeks ,  were read at a crowded news conference in baghdads green zone five days after voting took place . 
malikis alliance won the most council seats in baghdad and in the crucial shiite southern province of basra ,  an oil hub that had been dominated by the rival supreme islamic iraqi council  ( siic )  . 
the dawa partys slate was named enforcing the law for the purposes of the election ,  reinforcing maliki's image as a strong man who could bring security to the country . 
in the volatile northern province of ninevah ,  the nationalist sunni arab hadba bloc won <num>48.4</num>  percent of votes ,  ending kurdish and shi ' ite dominance on the provincial council . 
the sunni victory had been expected because sunni arabs had boycotted the <num>2005</num>  election . 
that led to shi ' ite and kurdish dominance across the country ,  even in mainly sunni areas ,  and was blamed for fuelling sectarian and ethnic unrest .

presidents doubts about new law prove justified
the amendments to the law on religions were adopted by parliament in november and outlawed all religious activity not approved by the authorities . 
 ( photo by uriel sinai / getty images ) 
president nazarbayev ,  whose approval was sought for the new law ,  then referred the matter to the constitutional council . 
igor rogov ,  the president of the constitutional council ,  said the amendments were declared invalid because they conflicted with the constitutional principles of universal equality before the law and freedom of religion . 
the constitutional councils press secretary gulnara baigeldi pointed out that the law failed to give a clear definition of freedom of religion and did not clarify how this differed from the constitutional right to freedom of conscience . 
calls to toughen the law on religions had come from the national security committee . 
the ministry of foreign affairs strongly objected ,  pointing to the governments obligations arising from its future presidency of the osce . 
the amendments also drew criticism from human rights campaigners and the international community expressed in a report published in january <num>2009</num>  by the osce office for democratic institutions and human rights .

other important issues according to president bakiyev are the countrys environmental and information security . 
the text of the document has not yet been published ,  but the president did cite the main threats mentioned in it .

they plan to overthrow secular governments by violent means ,  he stressed . 
the president has also given orders for the creation of special regional committees on which representatives of the religious affairs agency will sit . 
these committees will discuss the growing influence of religious organisations in kyrgyzstan and recommend appropriate action . 
the domestic threats cited by bakiyev included socio-economic woes and associated conflicts . 
a loan of us$300 million from russia will be used to improve the socio-economic situation ,  he said . 
bakiyev has also instructed civil servants across the country to draw up regional development programmes .

while the reports experts believe that the state of the press in kazakhstan is relatively stable compared to the situation with its neighbours in the region ,  the country still has a whole series of problems with respect to the media including censorship ,  legislation restricting the actions of the media and periodic attacks on journalists . 
the report also noted that the majority of local media belongs to the president of the republic nursultan nazarbayev and his cronies ,  and that various methods of pressure are brought against the oppositions media .

turkmenistan - an internet centre was opened in late january in the saparmurat turkmenbashi national library in ashgabat . 
the news spread fast and the number of visitors to the library soared the next day . 
prior to <num>2008</num>  , turkmenistan had fewer than <num>1,000</num>  registered internet users because the previous president had banned private internet access . 
the situation changed when he died . 
today turkmenistan has state and public internet cafes ,  and as of last june anyone in ashgabat can sign up with turkmentelecom ,  the countrys only internet provider . 
the library internet centre was opened under an international project called the virtual silk way that was coordinated by turkmenistans supreme council for science and technology under the turkmen president . 
the partnership for peace programme turkmenistan embarked upon three years ago with nato provided the stimulus for introducing leading information technology . 
under the programme ,  scientific institutions and universities connected under the national science and education network have begun using international satellite networks . 
pakistan arms villagers to fight taliban
peshawar-officials in pakistans north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  who recently signed a controversial peace deal with taliban militants in the swat valley announced plans to distribute rifles and create a new elite police force as part of a new strategy to confront terrorism . 
security experts warned ,  however ,  that the local government's plan could spark a civil war . 
the peace deal in swat has caused some alarm among coalition forces because the region is only <num>100</num>  miles from the pakistani capital islamabad . 
the nwfp ,  including its capital peshawar ,  has seen a dramatic surge in taliban attacks over the last year including beheadings ,  shootings and bomb attacks on pro-government politicians and schools attended by girls . 
pakistani taliban groups are believed to control key areas just outside of peshawar in the khyber agency where raids have interrupted nato forces supply routes in afghanistan . 
nwfp chief minister haider khan hoti said that the new elite force and the decision to arm villagers with weapons seized from terrorists and other  " anti-state "  elements are part of a strategy to challenge taliban and al-qaeda forces in the province . 
nato is expected to back the formation of a national elite police force to hold on to territory cleared of taliban forces in pakistan army offensives . 
but security experts warned that arming villagers could backfire . 
mahmood shah ,  a former security chief in pakistan's tribal areas ,  said the initiative could lead to a civil war in the region . 
tajik cotton industry in severe crisis
tajikistan - the cotton industry ,  the most important sector in tajik agriculture ,  is experiencing a severe crisis . 
cotton growers have not met their white gold harvest targets for many years ,  and their debts continue to grow . 
economist rustam dzhabborov said the rise in debt points to the fact that tajik agrarian policy has not been very effective ,  resulting in the ineffective spending of state funds . 
kazakhstan receives the new russian president
russian president ,  dmitry medvedev ,  made his first foreign trip to kazakhstan in a bid to maintain his countrys influence in the energy-rich central asian region on may <num>22</num>  .
kazakh president ,  nursultan nazarbayev ,  used the visit to strengthen the role he is staking out for himself as a regional power in speaking out for the interests of his smaller neighbours . 
at a time when russian relations with the west and pro-western cis countries such as georgia and ukraine have plummeted to all-time lows since the break-up of the ussr ,  the choice of kazakhstan as the first foreign destination for medvedev was not accidental . 
the choice of kazakhstan as the first country for medvedev to visit as president of the russian federation should stress the significance of kazakhstan in russias foreign policy . 
kazakhstan and russia have maintained close ties in all spheres of cooperation and on most key issues of international politics . 
both russia and china have used the shanghai cooperation organisation - a security body that groups the two countries and the four central asian countries of kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan - as a tool to further their interests in central asia ,  and limit these countries exposure to western influence . 
although medvedevs visit was seen as an exercise in forging a personal relationship with nazarbayev ,  the kazak president used it to promote new aspects of his countrys foreign policy . 
kazakhstan is now keen to act as the regional powerbase and economic leader among its smaller neighbours . 
kazakhstan used medvedevs visit to assume a greater role as a promoter of these countries interests . 
nazarbayev worked into the joint statement ,  a section on combating discrimination ,  which a pressing issue in modern-day russia where there has been a rise in racially motivated attacks that have resulted in the deaths of central asian nationals . 
the russian governments inability or unwillingness to fight racism has raised concern in central asian countries ,  which every year send millions of migrant workers to russia . 
the joint statement said the presidents reiterate their determination to counteract ,  in the territories of their countries ,  any form of discrimination ,  as well as the activities of organisations and population groups or certain individuals that aim to sow inter-ethnic discord or incite violence against citizens because of their ethnic origin . 
analysts do not doubt that this was nazarbayevs initiative . 
the kazakh authorities feel that they need to step in and help because their russian counterparts have not acted fiercely enough against assaulters ,  said maria disenova ,  an analyst at the institute for economic strategies in central asia . 
for bishkek ,  russian money talks
kyrgyzstan-despite official disavowals from both bishkek and moscow of any connection between russian aid and kyrgyzstans decision to close the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  base at manas international airport ,  most political analysts ,  independent observers and politicians agree they are linked . 
moscow has offered the kyrgyz government us$2 million in direct aid and us$150 million in loans . 
russian president medvedev said ,  the funds are to be directed towards balancing the countrys budget and developing key infrastructure projects ,  including hydroelectric plants . 
most of the region's media see kyrgyzstan's choices as severely constrained . 
price hikes for uzbek gas and dropping water levels in the toktogul reservoir have hit the country hard . 
many feel that generating electricity is the country's only real path to fill government coffers . 
for president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  the kremlin's money is crucial to holding on to his presidency as russian media assert . 
 " without the funds ,  bakiyev risks losing the presidency as a result of the country's energy crisis . 
the country's power companies have piled up us$62 million in tax arrears ,  and uzbekistan has increased the price of gas from <num>145</num>  $  to <num>240</num>  $  per thousand cubic metres . 
this situation is exacerbated by rising unemployment and consolidation of opposition forces ,  which is a direct threat to the kyrgyz president's position "  ,  according to the russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta . 
despite almost unanimous support among kyrgyzstan's political forces for closing the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  base ,  some of the country's political establishment are already warning of repercussions . 
 " i am categorically against it "  ,  says opposition leaders topchubek turgunaliyev ,  director of the institute for freedom and human rights . 
he believes that ,   " the manas and kant air bases provided geopolitical balance . 
if we evict coalition forces from their base ,  we need to evict the russians from theirs . 
otherwise kyrgyzstan will seem like a vassal state of russia "  ,  he said . 
 " kyrgyzstan should never be held hostage as a bargaining chip in the hands of a single country ,  but after the announcement of the closure of the manas air base ,  that's precisely what has happened "  ,  said parliament deputy baktybek beshimov ,  leader of the country's social democratic party . 
weakness becomes strength for uzbek banking system

the head of the ebrd office in uzbekistan ,  fernand pillonel ,  said the first version of the document was prepared in november <num>2008</num>  , though the worsening economic situation made ebrds experts reconsider their evaluation . 
at first ,  ebrd predicted the average economic growth in the countries it studied would be <num>2.5</num>  percent in <num>2009</num>  , though it has since lowered its projection to <num>0.1</num>  percent . 
the ebrd expects an economic growth of <num>5</num>  to <num>7</num>  percent in uzbekistan ,  which far exceeds the banks previous prediction . 
he noted that the uzbek economys strong indicators helped it maintain good prices for its main exports ,  particularly gold . 
the ebrd made particular note of the resiliency of the uzbek banking system . 
principal economist rika ishii believes that the countrys banking system has not yet fallen under the influence of the economic crisis . 
one reason for that is that most of the financial resources of uzbek banks are made up of stable deposits by their clients ,  rather than by attracting foreign investment ,  which is unusual at the present time . 
the ebrd is currently reviewing its activity in uzbekistan and plans to adopt a new three-year strategy by the end of <num>2009</num>  , pillonel said . 
according to that strategy ,  uzbekistan will be evaluated as a country where dialogue with the authorities is possible even during the crisis .

turkmenistan-young turkmen chess players brought home three medals-a gold ,  silver and bronze-from the prestigious grandmaster chess tournament in gurgaon ,  india in early february . 
three hundred players from <num>13</num>  countries ,  including <num>17</num>  grandmasters  ( chess's highest rank )  ,  took part in the international competition . 
nine players from turkmenistan ranging from ten to <num>14</num>  years old took part in competitive play . 
the tournament was held over ten rounds in accord with the swiss tournament system . 
the three medal-winners also received personal rankings on the players list maintained by the federation internationale des echecs  ( fide )  ,  chess's governing body . 
threatening guards and guests with bodily harm ,  the intruders overcame resistance . 
the bandits then took away all mobile phones and car keys ,  dismantled the video monitoring camera and stole the safe which held almost us$40 , 000
the criminals fled the scene in a lexus automobile which belonged to one of the guests . 
the abandoned vehicle was later found near the capital . 
the mvd does not exclude the possibility that the group took part in the attack on one of the capital's exchange offices in <num>2008</num>  .
at that time ,  the bandits killed an office employee and stole almost <num>12,000</num>  $  .
conference on historian ,  philosopher ,  healer and scholar mukhammet gaimaz turkmen ends
ashgabat - an international seminar titled mukhammet gaimaz turkmen :  prominent eastern scholar dedicated to the thinker ,  scholar and philosopher known as imam zekhebi who lived in the eighth and ninth centuries ended in turkmenistan on <abbr>feb.</abbr> 
scholars from afghanistan ,  azerbaijan ,  jordan ,  algeria ,  germany ,  the netherlands ,  iraq ,  syria ,  tunisia ,  and morocco participated in the event . 
in <num>2006</num>  , the country received <num>38</num>  unique manuscripts of his work that were preserved in syrian and other foreign libraries ,  which renewed interest in his life and studies . 
the miras turkmen national centre of cultural heritage and the supreme council of science and techniques organised their conference as part of the ongoing effort to restore gaimazs academic heritage . 
today imam zekhebi is known not only as a historian and philosopher ,  but as the author of medicine of the prophet . 
the thinkers manuscripts contain valuable information on the economic ,  physical ,  and spiritual development of the people of the east and are thus an invaluable resource for the study of the history and geography ,  anatomy and medicine ,  and culture and literature of the middle ages ,  ata dzhikiyev ,  phd in history and leading research associate at the turkmen history institute said at the conference . 
annual state department human rights report notes problem areas in kyrgyzstan
the report also states that ,  as before ,  corruption remains very widespread in kyrgyzstan ,  a common problem across central asia . 
last year ,  however ,  the government was able to take several steps in the fight against corruption ,  even arresting several government employees . 
while kyrgyz law prohibits discrimination based on sex ,  race ,  language and social status ,  in practise ,  according to state department information ,  serious violations in this area have been observed . 
discrimination against disabled peoples is also prohibited ,  but the rights of people with disabilities are infringed upon in the areas of job placement ,  education ,  health care and other government services . 
individuals who are not heterosexual are most often subjected to persecution and harassment ,  although homosexuality is not against the law in kyrgyzstan .

during a meeting regarding the companys activities in <num>2008</num>  , kmg president kairgeldy kabyldin said it had carried out a thorough review of its projects and will give priority to those aimed at modernising the national economy . 
the companys <num>2008</num>  investment total of <num>5.1</num>  $  billion was <num>260</num>  percent of its total <num>2007</num>  investment ;  and its revenues of <num>24.2</num>  $  billion in <num>2008</num>  was double its <num>2007</num>  total . 
the company did not announce any output forecasts for <num>2009</num>  , but experts suggest that oil production may fall this year due to the unfavourable situation in foreign markets ,  where more than <num>80</num>  percent of kazakhstans oil is sold . 
uzbek scientists find new marker for cancer cells
scientists at the uzbek republic center for anatomic pathology . 
the nature of this glow still has to be explained ,  but it is already clear that the created substance is an excellent visual marker for cancer cells . 
according to project leader malik abdullakhodjaev ,  a member of the uzbekistan academy of sciences ,  the possibility now exists of identifying cancer cells before they become tumorous . 
in the war on cancer ,  he said ,  winning the battle for time is most important . 
unlike other diagnostic methods ,  the new method only requires a few minutes . 
the effectiveness of the new method has already been tested as a result of a general examination of women's groups at several companies . 
in another case of uzbek scientific success in the treatment and diagnoses of malignant diseases ,  an ointment has been produced at the republic oncology research centre which successfully treats cancer at the first and second stages . 
according to dilnoza agzamkhodjaev ,  a centre researcher ,  such ointments are known in medicine ,  but because they are all extremely toxic they cannot be used as treatment . 
the new product ,  however ,  made from uzbekistan mountain herbs is already being used to treat patients at the centre and may replace chemotherapy and radioactive treatments of the disease . 
evidence indicates horses were domesticated in kazakhstan <num>5,500</num>  years ago
fragments of bone ,  teeth and earthenware pots used to store horse milk indicate that horses were selectively bred and domesticated to the east of the urals around <num>2,000</num>  years before they were first domesticated in europe ,  the science article reports . 
lead author alan outram ,  who works at the university of exeter in the uk ,  cites three main pieces of evidence for his theory . 
first ,  horse leg bones found in botai show similarities with the bones of domesticated horses from the bronze age and are very different from the bones of wild horses . 
secondly ,  archaeologists have also found regular marks on horse teeth indicating that the horses had worn bridles or similar objects . 
thirdly ,  analysis of organic residues found on broken pots revealed the presence of mares milk . 
if horses really were domesticated at such an early date ,  then we ought to think about the social and economic changes that also may have occurred earlier . 
it could turn out that there are other things we dont yet know . 
horses have long played a central role in kazakh culture . 
kazakhs worshipped them ,  created a large number of different breeds and were unrivalled horsemen . 
despite their great respect for the animals ,  kazakhs eat horse meat and in ancient times drank their blood . 
the number of students with mobile phones ,  particularly in the middle grades ,  is rapidly rising .

dushanbe- tajikistans lower house of parliament adopted an amendment to the education law banning the use of mobile phones in schools and institutions of higher learning . 
according to chair of the parliamentary committee on science ,  education ,  culture and youth policy dodikhudo saymiddinov ,  schoolchildren are prohibited from bringing mobile phones into school ,  while university students and professors are barred from using them while class is in session . 
the education ministry first attempted to ban mobile phones in schools in <num>2007</num>  .
the government directives on the issue however ,  were not always followed and the number of mobile phone-toting students ,  particularly in the middle grades ,  has grown rapidly . 
easy access to mobile phone services is partly to blame . 
currently ,  the dozen or so mobile phone companies operating in the country offer inexpensive rates with no sign-up fees . 
parliament deputy dzhamboy sanginov contends that research indicates mobile phone use can have a harmful effect on the human body . 
newly elected deputy yusuf akhmedov ,  a critic of the amendment ,  notes the measure does not outline sanctions against students who violate it . 
he also suggests putting public telephones in educational institutions so that parents may contact their children . 
world bank to participate in rogun dam project
tajikistan- the world bank confirmed march <num>11</num>  it is ready to work with tajikistan's government on building the rogun hydroelectric dam . 
it will provide funds to conduct a formal study of the potential effects of the dam across the region and examine the project's technical and economic feasibility and evaluate potential social and environmental impacts . 
the contract to conduct this study will be awarded to a consulting company with a strong international reputation . 
the study will take into account the needs and wishes of neighbouring afghanistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  kazakhstan ,  turkmenistan and uzbekistan . 
in keeping with internal policies on environmental protection and social welfare ,  the world bank will create a commission of international experts to provide an independent assessment of the study's conclusions .

the tajik academy of sciences estimates that total silver reserves at the bolshoi koni mansur field in sogdi province top <num>50,000</num>  tonnes and could be developed for more than <num>150</num>  years . 
over the short term ,  the silver field should create many jobs and boost development of infrastructure in northern tajikistan . 
although tajikistan has rich natural resources the development of the mining industry has been slowed by the countrys geographic remoteness and low foreign direct investment ,  said chairman of the state property and investment committee farrukh khamraliyev . 
corruption in tajikistan preventing democratic and social reforms

according to the authors of the report ,  the observance of human rights is poor in tajikistan and corruption continues to hinder democratic and social reforms . 
the report says the countrys laws include criminal punishment for corruption by officials ,  but the government does not enforce the law . 
the researchers also point out that ,  in <num>2008</num>  , the government continued to limit religious freedoms and that the situation is only getting worse . 
also ,  concern by officials over foreign influence has resulted in the placement of limitations on some religious minorities in the country . 
yusuf salimov ,  head of the department for constitutional guarantees of human rights within the presidents office ,  said the situation will improve at closed institutions when the law on the human rights commissioner takes effect .

tashkent - cars made by gm uzbekistan went on general sale in tashkent for the first time at the beginning of march . 
previously ,  the companys nexia ,  matiz and damas models could be bought by uzbeks only by putting their name on a waiting list or paying inflated prices on the second-hand market . 
until now ,  gm uzbekistan cars were more expensive on the domestic market than abroad . 
since components for gm cars are also manufactured in uzbekistan ,  experts believe domestic prices could fall by <num>30</num>  to <num>40</num>  percent in the near future . 
human trafficking networks spread to uzbekistan

these statistics ,  however ,  do not represent the full picture because uzbekistan does very little to protect its citizens living abroad . 
according to svetlana gannushkina ,  director of the civil advocacy organisation and member of the memorial human rights centre ,  uzbek embassy officials show little interest in citizens who have fallen into slavery outside the country ,  preferring to pretend that the problem does not exist . 
inside uzbekistan ,  however ,  more active efforts are being undertaken to combat this type of crime . 
in <num>2008</num>  , a law on combating human trafficking was adopted and an interagency national commission was formed to steer efforts in this area . 
additionally ,  the labour and social security ministry's agency for migratory work drafted an initiative at the end of last year to bar all people and organisations without special permits from placing advertisements on finding work abroad . 
efforts are being made to increase the population's awareness of the risks when shady people offer hassle-free moneymaking trips outside the country .

astana-a new food storage complex built in astana for us$3 . 5 million designed to process an average of two tonnes of produce an hour is kazakhstans first to incorporate fully-automated equipment and refrigeration technology to keep fruits and vegetables fresh for longer than a year . 
inside the coolers ,  the gas mix and temperature cycles will be controlled directly from the offices of the equipment manufacturer in germany . 
workers in almaty will be responsible for daily processing of the produce . 
market access to fresh fruits and vegetables year-round at reasonable prices will help even out seasonal spikes in their prices . 
after the first harvest ,  the storage complex is expected to operate at full capacity . 
according to almaty region deputy governor tynyshpay dosymbekov ,  the agricultural storage facility is a first step in creating a food belt around almaty developed to avert any disruptions in food supply during crises . 
future phases of the project will expand financing to other areas of the country .

turkemenistan - a new annual competition has been established in turkmenistan for the best horse . 
president berdymukhamedov made the announcement march <num>13</num>  after hearing the cabinet of ministers report on the results of their work for the first two months of <num>2009</num>  .
he also announced a decision to give farmers decommissioned agricultural equipment formerly used on state farms free of charge . 
berdymukhamedov is not the only political leader who is promoting sport by personal example . 
vladimir putin ,  the russian prime minister and former president ,  wrote a manual on judo and was even filmed for an instructional video . 
the previous publication by the turkmen president ,  who was educated as a dentist ,  concerns dentistry . 
speaking of his decision to distribute decommissioned agricultural equipment for free ,  berdymukhamedov said that ,  after being repaired ,  the equipment will continue to serve growers for a long time and be quite useful . 
he added that it will also be necessary ,  of course ,  to establish credit lines and open stores in every region so that recipients of the free equipment the state gives away can spend their money on replacement parts . 
eu to assist with prison reform in kyrgyzstan
zubov said that most of the eu funding will be used to obtain the services of foreign experts and provide training courses . 
following the abolition of the death penalty in <num>2007</num>  , the ministry of justice became aware of the need to build special facilities for lifers ,  who currently number more than <num>180</num>  .
zubov also announced that if eu funding proves inadequate ,  the central penal correction department will ask the government to allocate the needed funds . 
he said that the two facilities planned for chuy and naryn provinces will cost us$25 million to build ,  while <num>11.3</num>  $  million will be allocated from the treasury to cover the cost of accommodating prisoners . 
the us$10 . 4 million allocated for this purpose in <num>2008</num>  was inadequate ,  he said . 
the cost of feeding ill prisoners was <num>1.65</num>  $  a day while <num>1.10</num>  $  per day was spent on feeding healthy prisoners . 
hygiene and health standards in the kyrgyz prison system remain poor . 
an annual report issued by the kyrgyz ombudsman states that this is due to substandard condition of prison cells ,  inadequate food supplies and outbreaks of tuberculosis . 
in <num>2008</num>  , the incidence of tuberculosis in kyrgyz prisons rose to <num>427</num>  cases and over the first <num>11</num>  months of last year <num>34</num>  prisoners died from the disease . 
un small grants provide alternatives for caspian residents
turkmenistan- a second round of selections has been made in turkmenistan for a small grants programme through the un-funded programme entitled ,  conservation and sustainable use of globally significant biological diversity in khazar nature reserve on the caspian sea coast . 
four projects were chosen for total funding of us$14 , 000
the funds are earmarked for the chekishler ,  garagel and belek villages ,  and will go towards opening a sewing workshop ,  a souvenir-making studio ,  a fruit and vegetable farm and a music school . 
the programme's main goal is to provide local residents with alternate livelihoods which do not deplete the biological resources of the caspian sea . 
the gyzylgum project ,  another grant recipient ,  will assist an agricultural enterprise that uses unique methods for growing fruits and vegetables in poor coastal soils . 
undp public relations specialist dayanch khodzhageldyyev notes that residents of these communities have shown themselves to be particularly resourceful . 
after two rounds of the undp programme in turkmenistan ,  ten programmes are now off the ground and running .

tajikistan seeks investors for rail line to afghanistan
freight volumes on tajikistan's railways increased nearly <num>30</num>  percent in <num>2008</num>  .
economic gains from the railway are expected to bring tajikistan an additional <num>12</num>  $  million each year ,  and the project is expected to pay for itself in ten years . 
construction costs are currently borne by tajikistan's railways administration ,  but the government hopes to attract foreign investment to help finance the project . 
analysts now speculate about possible future <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  involvement in the project in light of bottlenecks that may limit resupplying <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  troops in afghanistan through pakistan . 
more than <num>526</num>  $  million is being poured into tajikistan's transportation system through <num>12</num>  different construction projects . 
freight volumes along tajikistan's railways increased nearly <num>30</num>  percent in <num>2008</num>  to <num>2,767</num>  million tonnes .

blast kills <num>50</num>  at pakistan mosque
peshawar-an apparent suicide bombing in pakistan destroyed a mosque near the afghan border today ,  killing at least <num>50</num>  people and wounding more than <num>100</num>  , officials and witnesses said . 
the attack ,  near the town of jamrud in the khyber tribal area ,  came on the holiest day of the muslim week ,  as the mosque was packed with worshipers . 
in the aftermath of the blast ,  prayer caps ,  mobile phones and sandals lay scattered on the rocky ground . 
the mosque was located close to the main highway and frequented by locals as well as travellers . 
ranking local official tariq hayat khan told pakistan tv that the bomber managed to make his way into the mosque compound undetected .

dushanbe-on march <num>28</num>  , an active member of the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  who was operating in a criminal group in the northern part of the country ,  was detained in tajikistan . 
he was located in khudzhande ,  the administrative centre of the sogdiisk region ,  and arrested . 
tajikistan deputy minister of internal affairs sharif nazarov said okhunov was charged with organising a criminal group . 
the head of the criminal group ,  <num>41</num> -year old anvarjon kayumov ,  a native and resident of the city of isfara ,  was arrested in afghanistan at the end of <num>2008</num>  on charges of committing serious crimes and turned over to tajikistan law enforcement authorities . 
a criminal case has been initiated against him on charges that he organised an armed attack against tajik police in august last year . 
in tajikistan ,  imu members are located mainly in the isfara district of the sogdiisk region because ,  experts say ,  its population has been known for its extreme devoutness even during the soviet era . 
in isfara ,  extremist groups ,  including the imu and hizb ut-tahrir ,  have been able to find supporters who are susceptible to religious and ideological indoctrination . 
for example ,  the destruction of old ideological principles ,  the emergence of a large number of people who have not been able to find themselves during the transition period and do not have jobs made a number of them susceptible to the ideological appeal of groups such as the imu .

dushanbe - at the end of march ,  tajik scholars presented an electronic catalogue they had created of <num>500</num>  ancient eastern manuscripts .

the disk catalogue has thematic and alphabetical indices ,  and is in farsi ,  russian and english . 
there are currently about <num>500</num>  disks being distributed for free among interested individuals and organisations . 
we plan to put an electronic version of the catalogue online soon so a larger audience can access it ,  ilchibekov said .

dushanbe - the board of executive directors of the world bank  ( wb )  announced on march <num>27</num>  that it will grant tajikistan a us$20 million loan to help it deal with the effects of the global financial crisis . 
the grant will be provided in the form of direct supplement to the national budget and will be used to implement reforms and a poverty reduction programme . 
it will partly plug the deficit that has arisen because of the global economic crisis . 
the funds will be applied to a government programme aimed at preserving macroeconomic stability in the country ;  improving the investment climate by way of reforms to the licensing and inspections systems ;  making the privatisation process more transparent ;  and encouraging the development of market competition ,  said chiara bronchi ,  the world bank permanent representative in tajikistan . 
she added that the grant supplements efforts of other wb international development partners that are intended to help the government provide basic public services such as health care ,  education and welfare . 
independent economist pulod nasimov said wb assistance came at the right time since national bank of tajikistan foreign currency reserves are heavily depleted and need to be topped up . 
the fall in export revenues has already begun to have an adverse effect on the balance of payments and foreign currency reserves ,  he commented . 
the world bank forecasts that tajikistans economic growth will decrease this year to three percent . 
it was nine percent annually between <num>2000</num>  and <num>2007</num>  .
according to bank experts ,  the decrease will be the result of the fall in remittances from tajik workers in russia and lower demand for cotton and aluminium ,  tajikistans main exports . 
this is the third project launched by the world bank in a bid to help the government bring about reform . 
pakistan flogging video stirs controversy
taliban members prepare a man for public flogging in the swat valley in pakistan . 
 ( reuters ) 
the government agreed to allow islamic law in the swat valley under a peace deal struck with a hard-line cleric ,  sparking criticism from activists who are worried extremists will violate basic human rights ,  especially those of women . 
 " non-state actors have taken law and justice into their hands in a whole area with the force of their guns "  ,  she told the aaj television network . 
 " they want to enforce a taliban-style system in the area ,  and we will not let it happen in pakistan .  " 
a crowd of men watches silently in the background ,  and a voice can be heard saying ,   " hold her hands tightly .  " 
it was not exactly clear when the incident took place or who carried it out . 
local taliban spokesman muslim khan said the militant group publicly flogged a woman in swat nine months ago over allegations that she had an illicit relationship with her father-in-law with whom she was living ,  but he was not sure if the video showed that incident . 
khan ,  the taliban spokesman ,  defended the punishment ,  although he said it should not have been done in public and should have been carried out by a boy who had not yet reached puberty . 
president asif ali zardari has yet to sign the bill introducing islamic law in the valley .

 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ) 
dushanbe - islamic revival party leader mukhiddin kabiri announced a new special central asian peace award named for said abdullo nuri . 
the award will be granted to people who have made important contributions to strengthening and spreading peace in tajikistan and throughout central asia . 
one of the most influential politicians and religious figures in the country ,  nuri died in <num>2006</num>  .
he headed the islamic revival party for <num>13</num>  years before his death . 
the party was part of the united tajik opposition in the early <num>1990</num>  second  that opposed the government national front between <num>1992</num>  and <num>97</num>  during the nations civil war . 
nuri and tajik president emomali rakhmon in june <num>1997</num>  signed a peace treaty that ended the conflict . 
from <num>1997</num>  through <num>2000</num>  nuri chaired the national reconciliation committee set up to implement the peace agreement . 
observers said the national accord in the country was largely the product of nuris political flexibility . 
he was able to differentiate between party interests and national interests . 
as leader of the united tajik opposition ,  nuri and rakhmon played a decisive role in attaining peace in tajikistan ,  former head of the un peacekeeping bureau vladimir sotirov said . 
he will be remembered in tajik history primarily as a man and politician who was able to sacrifice the interests of his own party… to end the fratricidal war and promote political stability as a necessary foundation for tajikistans successful development . 
the justice ministry said that next to the national democratic party headed by president rakhmon and the communist party ,  the islamic revival party is the third largest in the country with <num>28,000</num>  members . 
it is the only islamic party officially active in central asia .

 ( photo :  vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
on april <num>2</num>  the office of kyrgyzstans general prosecutor initiated three criminal prosecutions against the opposition deputy in the kyrgyz parliament isa omurkulov ,  a member of the social democratic party and former head of the state railway company . 
at that time ,  the company had ,  according to him ,  obsolete goods valued at us$119 , 000 which were no longer being used . 
furthermore ,  the company had ,  via a front company in kazakhstan ,  purchased railway engines in russia for <num>1</num>  $  million . 
the former management of the railways is also suspected of evading tax of <num>80,000</num>  $  .
the immediate reason for the initiation of the criminal prosecution ,  however ,  was not the above ,  but a claim by kazakhstani citizen tauyrzhan baydauletov ,  who insists that in <num>2004</num>  he gave omurkulov a bribe of <num>60,000</num>  $  so that the daud travel company would receive a licence to supply equipment needed for the construction of the kochkor-torugart railway line without holding of a tender . 
kamchibekov asserted that omurkulov admitted this fact ,  confirmed in a video recording made in the deputys office and an audio recording of a telephone conversation . 
in this case ,  the general prosecutor is prosecuting him under article <num>311</num>   ( pay-offs and bribes )  of the criminal code of the republic of kyrgyzstan . 
for his part ,  chairman of kyrgyzstans committee against political persecution topchubek turgunaliev announced that with the approach of the presidential election there is not a single politician in the united opposition who will not be the subject of some sort of politically-motivated persecution .

tajikistan-on april <num>8</num>  , the national association of nongovernmental sources of media information in tajikistan ,  or nansmit ,  celebrated its tenth anniversary . 
in recognition of nansmits role in creating independent media in tajikistan ,  its chairman ,  nuriddin karshibayev ,  was awarded a top of class in tajikistans press lapel pin . 
nuriddin karshibayev notes ,   " over these ten years we've evolved from being just a group of people with similar interests to a functioning human rights organisation with a clearly defined mission and projects aimed at defending the rights and interests of media outlets and journalists . 
 "  for example ,  two reporters from the sughd regional newspaper ovoza ,  dzhumaboi tolibov and tursunali aliyev ,  were acquitted of slander charges thanks to the legal efforts of nansmit and other media organisations . 
the uncertainty over a candidate representing all of the opposition remains . 
ak-shumkar leader temir sariyev said a final decision would be made by the middle of the month . 
al-shabab :  an examination of somali piracy and its links to terrorism
and although no link has been established between this incident and al-shabab or any terrorist group ,  a recent report in janes defence weekly identified definite financial links between somali pirates and al-shabab . 
specifically ,  the pirates in kismayu often coordinate with al-shabab ,  although al-shabab members themselves apparently do not play any active role in acts of piracy . 
shinn says there is increasing evidence that the pirates are assisting al-shabab with arms smuggling and are also developing an independent maritime force to smuggle foreign jihadist fighters and special weapons into somalia . 
several senior national security officials told the washington post that al-shabab's rapid expansion ,  ties between its leaders and al-qaeda ,  and the presence of <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and european-born fighters in its camps have raised the question of whether a pre-emptive strike is warranted . 
 " there is increasing concern about what terrorists operating in somalia might do "  ,  a <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  counterterrorism official said . 
additionally ,  al-shabab camps have graduated hundreds of fighters .

the national foreign exchange reserves have also surged this week to us$11 . 3 billion ,  up from last weeks <num>10.09</num>  $  billion ,  following the disbursement of <num>1.3</num>  $  billion by the world bank and the international monetary fund . 
government officials and financial experts believe that the anticipated cut in the discount policy rate this month ,  coupled with a significant decline in inflation ,  would further augment economic growth and stability . 
unlike in the west ,  capital market analysts say ,  none of pakistans financial entities collapsed during the global economic crisis that stunned business experts around the world . 
for the last year ,  the pakistani corporate sector has been facing both domestic political chaos and the global financial crisis . 
recent signs of economic improvement and the political truce in the country have ,  however ,  made the sector more optimistic about economic growth in the months ahead .

tajikistan-on april <num>16</num>  , tajikistan's unicef office kicked off an awareness campaign to ward off the spread of bird flu . 
despite the fact that tajikistan has yet to register a single case of bird flu ,  the country is considered a high-risk zone because of its location on the paths of migrating birds . 
in addition ,  the country's widespread practice of keeping household poultry increases the risk of possible infection of people who come into contact with the birds . 
unicef representative for tajikistan hongwei gao points out that women and children are most at risk for bird flu infection since they handle both chores related to household poultry farming and family food preparation . 
unicef is working with the media to raise awareness among these two groups ,  and hopes that information about preventing bird flu will reach all those who may be at risk .

kazakhstans authorities insist that the bill is intended to protect young people from negative information on the internet . 
just a day earlier ,  a group of internet users in almaty ,  kazakhstans largest city ,  held a symbolic funeral for the . 
kz web domain ,  arguing that if the draft legislation becomes law ,  web access in kazakhstan will be buried alive . 
the government insists that the bill is largely aimed at protecting young people from negative information on the internet ,  such as extremist ,  pornographic and other harmful websites and blogs expressing individual opinions on any issue under the sun . 
according to anna karlsreiter ,  an advisor to the osce representative in kazakhstan ,  whatever resources are allocated to internet regulation ,  efforts to control it will fail .

on april <num>20</num>  the leaders of a number of media outlets and ngos called on the president of kazakhstan to use his powers to withdraw the bill on internet regulation and to engage them in a review of the overall media situation in the country . 
united against drugs
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ambassador richard norland inspects the state-of-the-art equipment presented to the uzbek crime laboratory as us aid
a group of american forensics experts conducted a number of training sessions for their uzbek colleagues . 
uzbek forensic science technicians are unanimous in their belief that the new gas chromatograph mass spectrometer  ( gcms )  ,  installed as part of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  aid project ,  will help uzbek law enforcement agencies identify illegal drugs . 
this project is a clear example of successful cooperation between our two countries in the fight against a serious shared threat ,  gnyazov said . 
the american equipment will definitely be of great assistance to uzbek forensic science technicians who daily identify afghan and tajik narcotic substances discovered in raids by the uzbek police . 
according to ministry of the interior statistics ,  <num>8834</num>  drug crimes were brought to light in <num>2007</num>  by the republics law enforcement agencies . 
a total of <num>1</num>  tonne <num>792.2</num>  kg of drugs were confiscated in the past year . 
on the evidence of the past decade ,  the most popular drug among traders is heroin ,  of which <num>537.24</num>  kg were seized .

tajikistan - in the new school year ,  tajik schoolchildren and students will study new topics in the field of international humanitarian law ,  including human rights and introductory pre-service training . 
an agreement on the subject was signed on april <num>21</num>  by the ministry of education ,  the tajik society of the red crescent  ( tsrc )  and the central asian office of the international committee of the red cross  ( icrc )  . 
as icrc official murojon soliev said ,  the ministry of education is meeting its obligation to integrate international humanitarian law  ( ihl )  into its academic programmes and educational standards for middle-school and higher education . 
they will also provide consultative support to ministry specialists and partner universities-the russian-tajik slavic university ,  tajik national university and teacher training institutes . 
icrc regional deputy director raffaello muller said he hopes for continuity in teaching ihl in the countrys schools and universities after <num>2010</num>  .
netherlands red cross programme coordinator davron mukhammadiev noted that the agreement will contribute significantly to raising legal literacy among students and schoolchildren .

grassroots ethnic strife not uncommon in kyrgyzstan
while the situation in kyrgyzstan cannot be characterised as violently xenophobic ,  experts believe the potential for grassroots ethnic strife of this sort always lingers just below the surface . 
most recently on april <num>11</num>  , ethnic slurs in the kyrgyz language were scrawled across houses in the village of kyzyl-bayrak . 
police chose to characterise the incident as vandalism instead of a hate crime ,  which angered many local residents . 
advocates for minorities in kyrgyzstan remain convinced that authorities are attempting to downplay ethnic tensions because such incidents do not conform to kyrgyzstan's official image of itself as a society characterised by interethnic harmony .

aral summit did not meet expectations
the kokaral dam between the lesser and great aral has filled the northern portion of the sea ,  expanding it to <num>3,250</num>  square km . 
 ( photo by antoine la broschini / afp / getty images ) 
kazakhstan - the april <num>28</num>  almaty summit of members of the international fund for saving the aral sea produced several organisational decisions and a joint statement ,  but failed to achieve the hoped-for progress in finding solutions for the regions hydro energy problems . 
the meeting ,  which drew the heads of all central asian nations ,  despite concerns that uzbek president islam karimov might not attend ,  was tense . 
statements made before the meeting split the central asian countries into two blocs . 
kyrgyzstan and tajikistan ,  which are at the source of the main rivers in the regions ,  want to build hydroelectric plants on trans-border rivers to solve their energy problems ,  while turkmenistan and uzbekistan ,  both further downstream and in need of irrigation water ,  oppose this plan . 
kazakhstan ,  positioned somewhere in the middle ,  tried to mediate between the two blocs ,  but astanas interests are similar to the countries downstream from the rivers amudarya and syrdarya . 
the joint statement passed by summit participants was limited to a general declaration of the need to continue cooperation aimed at improving the environmental and socio-economic situation in the aral sea basin ,  and an expression of interest in developing a mutually acceptable mechanism for using the water resources and protecting the environment in central asia based on the interests of all countries in the region . 
the heads of state ,  however ,  seemed more interested in promoting the interests of their own countries than in trying to find a comprehensive solution to the regions water and energy problems . 
the disputes and insults exchanged among the countries ,  and the inability to reach a compromise ,  are forcing countries to address the problems on their own . 
for example ,  kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev ,  who chairs the fund ,  said ,  we will soon begin the second phase of an eight phase project to regulate the course of the syrdarya river that will cost us <num>191</num>  $  million . 
a quarter of tajik industrial enterprises shut down
dushanbe - over <num>200</num>  tajik production facilities ,  which account for <num>26.3</num>  percent of the national total ,  have been at a complete standstill since the start of <num>2009</num>  .
according to first deputy minister for economic development and trade amonullo ashur ,  one reason for the inactivity was the electricity shortage in the first quarter of the year ,  which rendered businesses unable to function causing them to lose domestic market outlets and operating capital . 
another ,  he said ,  is that business leaders are not paying sufficient attention to the market to produce competitive products . 
according to the tajik state statistics committee ,  industrial manufacturing output stood at roughly us$200 million in the first quarter ,  a decline of <num>8.2</num>  percent from the same period in <num>2008</num>  .
in the chemical and petrochemical industries alone ,  production dropped by <num>61.3</num>  percent .

kazakhstan-the countries of central asia are taking all possible precautions to head off the spread of h1n1 influenza to their territory . 
all the countries in the region have stepped up disease control and quarantine measures at airports ,  train stations and border crossings ,  and have held information sessions for employees in those transit areas on recognising the symptoms of swine flu ,  its transmission and treatment .

pakistanis support military action against taliban and back paramilitary forces
a recent video showing the taliban flogging a young woman as the militants imposed their version of sharia law on swat shocked the nation ,  while the talibans beheading of two local government officials last week sparked outrage . 
finally ,  the taliban incursion into buner two weeks ago solidified a growing consensus that they have gone too far and that the military needed to stand up to them ,  which has provided the catalyst for the military to act . 
on the ground ,  however ,  there has been a significant change in the military and paramilitary forces ranged against the taliban . 
under the leadership of energetic and determined commander <url>maj.gen.tariq</url>  khan ,  the frontier corps ,  a local pashtun paramilitary force ,  has become better armed and equipped with <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  assistance . 
supported by army units ,  it has proved itself better able to push back the taliban ,  first in the tribal areas in bajaur last year ,  and now in buner . 
anti-terrorist police units that are better suited to counterinsurgency operations have also been deployed in operations in outlying districts . 
those from peshawar killed <num>88</num>  suspected militants in the last four months ,  cracking down on kidnappings and general lawlessness that had reached directly into the city ,  a senior police official said .

president obama speaks to the media in the white house with afghan president hamid karzai  ( l )  and pakistan president asif ali zardari  ( r )  may <num>6</num>  .

in remarks delivered with afghan president hamid karzai and pakistani president asif ali zardari at the white house ,  obama said the security of afghanistan ,  pakistan and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  are linked . 
obamas remarks came after a day of talks with karzai and zardari designed to help forge a more coordinated strategy against the resurgent extremists . 
while we will need high levels of support in days to come ,  we will also be far more transparent in our actions ,  zardari told the group . 
he also voiced assurances that the three countries will stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the world to fight this cancer and this threat . 
karzai said he was certain that implementation of the strategy outlined by president obama will bring the needed relief for a better ,  more peaceful life in both afghanistan and pakistan . 
he promised afghanistan will work hard to build confidence and trust with pakistan to wage a more effective struggle against terrorism and the violence that radicalism causes both in pakistan and in afghanistan and the danger that they pose to you in america and the rest of the world .  " 
baysun reveals its secrets
most uzbeks will respond :  a secret place with strange people . 
this veil of secrecy may be lifted by an exhibition that opened recently in the settlements baysun museum of folk art . 
scholars hope that it will provide answers to many mysteries - but not all . 
baysun is located in a canyon between the mountains in the south of uzbekistan . 
it is an area that was settled ,  long ago ,  by people who had arrived from the ends of the earth along with the caravans that moved through the valley along the silk road . 
the entrance into the canyon was guarded by a wall similar to the great wall of china . 
the guards did not allow everyone to enter ,  only the nobles and the healthy . 
this is what they say about baysun :  stick a dry staff in the ground and a rose bush will grow . 
academician of the uzbekistan academy of arts ,  akbar khakimov ,  believes that the local inhabitants have in them the blood of at least <num>20</num>  nationalities - from europeans to koreans . 
the significant feature of the people of baysun is their piercing blue eyes ,  which stands out among the black-haired and black-eyed peoples of central asia . 
scholars remain astonished ,  but the baysun people smile and say :  this is from our blue heaven ,  for we have <num>300</num>  cloudless days a year . 
and here is a childs ceramic whistle ,  shuvullok . 
if you blow it ,  it sounds just like a rocket engine starting up . 
our baysun is a long way from cape kennedy but the first thing our children hear is the roar of the shuttle taking off . 
turkmenistan border guards shoot to kill
in the soviet era ,  residents of the khorezm region supported themselves by fishing the waters of what they call the khorezm sea . 
on april <num>20</num>  , the two were fishing in the waters of the tuyamuyun reservoir when they came under fire from turkmen border guards . 
the attack killed one and critically injured the other . 
nazhot believes that there is a strong likelihood uzbekistans police will find the injured man guilty of illegally crossing the unmarked national border thereby causing the death of his colleague . 
the tuyamuyun reservoir straddles the boundary between uzbekistan and turkmenistan ,  with uzbekistans portion of the lake falling in its khorezm region . 
because today there are no visible boundary markers in the water ,  fishermen from both countries frequently make unsanctioned but unintended border crossings as they drift across the surface of the lake .

poison gas may have hospitalised <num>84</num>  afghan girls
nabela ,  a nine year-old afghan schoolgirl looks on as she recovers in hospital ,  kapisa province ,  eastern afghanistan ,  may <num>12</num>  .
the taliban and other islamic fundamentalists have regularly attacked girls schools in afghanistan and the second apparent poisoning in two days has raised concerns that they have now found a new weapon to frighten girls into staying at home rather than attending class . 
students were gathering in the yard of aftab bachi school in muhmud raqi for a morning reading of the quran when a strange odour filled the area . 
first one girl collapsed ,  and then others ,  the school's principal ,  mossena ,  told ap from her hospital bed . 
 " i saw several students fall down on the ground "  ,  said mossena ,  who like many afghans goes by one name . 
an afghan school recovers in hospital after becoming ill at a school in kapisa province ,  eastern afghanistan ,  may <num>12</num>  .
at least <num>98</num>  people were admitted ,  including <num>84</num>  students ,  <num>11</num>  teachers and two cleaners ,  said khalid enayat ,  the hospital's deputy director . 
he said they were monitoring about another <num>30</num>  students to see if they developed symptoms . 
the incident is the third alleged poisoning at a girls school in two weeks . 
on may <num>11</num>  , <num>61</num>  schoolgirls and one teacher went to hospital in neighbouring parwan province with a sudden illness that caused some to faint . 
in late april ,  dozens of girls were hospitalised in parwan after being sickened by what officials said were strong fumes or a possible poison gas cloud . 
interior ministry spokesman zemeri bashary said officials suspect some sort of gas poisoning in kapisa ,  but police were still investigating . 
militants have previously assaulted schoolgirls by spraying acid in their faces and burning down schools to protest the government and girls' education . 
scores of afghan schools have been forced to close because of violence .

as thousands flee to escape fighting between the pakistan army and the taliban ,  some are cautiously sharing their stories ,  detailing how the taliban ran roughshod over cities and hamlets . 
kulsoom is from mingora ,  swats main city . 
providing just one name to protect her identity ,  she said she had quit a housekeeping job that helped support her family because of growing taliban restrictions on womens movements . 
she said she was stopped on the street while wearing a regular veil and warned by the taliban to wear an all-encompassing burqa instead . 
then there was the sickening moment a few months ago when she and her friends found the body of her distant relative . 
thirty-year-old shaheen said taliban forces in mingora burned down girls schools and threatened those carrying out activities they considered un-islamic . 
we are worried ,  she said . 
we have left behind completely furnished homes . 
we left with nothing . 
many residents were too fearful to say much ,  amid worries that some taliban sympathisers or relatives of militants were hiding among civilians . 
many said that while they never had violent run-ins with the taliban ,  they felt compelled to adjust their lifestyles to avoid offending taliban supporters in their neighbourhoods and suffering the sometimes horrid consequences of doing so .

central asias oldest university celebrates 91st anniversary
tashkent - the national university of uzbekistan celebrated its 91st anniversary on may <num>12</num>  .
it is the oldest university in uzbekistan and the first soviet university in central asia . 
education minister avaz marakhimov said the university is being gradually reconstructed . 
the yoshlik campus has been completely updated and includes the university and dormitories . 
the sports complex was modernised in preparation for a nationwide collegiate competition in <num>2008</num>  .
a water sports complex was built on campus ,  and stadiums ,  sports complexes and fields have been reconstructed to meet international standards . 
but students and officials have different views . 
technologically the departments are about <num>30</num>  years behind the times ,  said journalism student rustam <abbr>m.</abbr> 
over the past five years ,  he noted ,  the journalism department has used the physics building because it lacks its own . 
the condition and facilities in the department show the governments attitude towards journalism and education on the whole ,  one professor said . 
developing infrastructure at the university is crucial since it was here in the early <num>1990</num>  second  that unrest and extremist trends among youth began ,  said political analyst khatam abduraimov . 
he said it must be kept in mind that young people make up <num>60</num>  percent of the uzbek population and the states inability to create conditions to obtain a quality education may have a destabilising impact . 
uzbekistan has <num>65</num>  universities attended by <num>300,000</num>  students . 
no more false reports tajikistan assures imf
the letter also expresses the tajik governments concern that the country's economy in <num>2009</num>  is experiencing adverse effects caused by external conditions . 
the letter states that the slowing of growth in russia and kazakhstan has led to a sharp decrease in the flow of money transfers ,  and a decrease in demand and fall in world prices are negatively affecting cotton and aluminium exports . 
as a result ,  tajikistan is seeing restrictions in budgetary funds and external financing ,  and experiencing strain in the banking system . 
at the end of april <num>2009</num>  , the imf board of directors approved a new three-year <num>116</num>  $  million credit programme for tajikistan . 
tajikistan hopes to receive approximately <num>38</num>  $  million in the near future . 
in his letter ,  rakhmon expressed satisfaction with this programme and emphasised that the country's government is ready to take additional measures which may be required to achieve the programme's goals .

the report contained results of a study on the kyrgyz internet audience that polled <num>394</num>  internet users ,  <num>65</num>  private companies and public organisations ,  three internet providers and two mobile operators . 
the study found <num>60</num>  percent of the users rely on dial-up access and the rest use a dedicated line . 
just <num>1</num>  percent use wireless internet connections . 
according to experts ,  only a small number of people use the latter two types of connections because of the high prices charged by internet providers . 
for example ,  one hour of regular dial-up service costs <num>70</num>  cents ,  while an hour of wireless service costs us$5 . 
installation of a dedicated line costs about <num>200</num>  $  plus a user fee . 
more than <num>50</num>  percent of kyrgyz citizens use the internet for entertainment and communication ;  <num>40</num>  percent seek educational institutions on the internet and read the news ;  and only eight percent use the internet for business purposes ,  mambetaliyeva said .

instead of giving them an explanation ,  local authorities told them to disperse and threatened them with the use of force .

furthermore ,  neither witnesses nor those who were hurt recognised the people who were accused during the trial of attacking police officers . 
pakistan - a safe haven for terrorists ? 
pakistan is allowing taliban fighters wounded in battles with british and other nato forces in afghanistan to be treated at safe houses . 
taliban commanders and their fighters were found recuperating in the city of quetta and moving freely around parts of the city . 
in a white-walled compound in the northern suburb of pashtunabad ,  more than <num>30</num>  taliban were recovering from the bloodiest fighting in afghanistan since their regime was ousted five years ago . 
fighting the british is much easier than the americans . 
they have no faith . 
not a single known taliban has been arrested in pakistan apart from a spokesman ,  latifullah hakimi . 
that came only after british intelligence intercepted his telephone call from peshawar ordering the execution of a british engineer .

interior ministry spokesman makhmadullo asadulloyev said the forces were deployed to the eastern regions to destroy the opium crop there . 
due to good weather ,  a large planting of opium poppy and cannabis group narcotics was found in badakhshan ,  afghanistan ,  he said . 
experts affirmed ,  however ,  that opium has never been grown in the rashta valley . 
according to unconfirmed reports ,  a group of armed militants was discovered in the remote rashta mountain gorges just days ago that could have come from afghanistan and pakistan . 
political analysts think the group may be controlled by mullo abdullo ,  a field commander of the tajik opposition in the civil war who controlled a region of the rashta valley at the time . 
he did not recognise the <num>1994</num>  cease fire agreement in tajikistan ,  and after the <num>1997</num>  peace treaty his fighters continued to destabilise the region . 
tajik government forces in <num>2000</num>  conducted an operation to neutralise his group ,  but abdullo and his closest associates fled to afghanistan where they fought for the taliban . 
fighters from the islamic movement of uzbekistan ,  another terrorist group that fought with the taliban in pakistan ,  might also be seeking refuge in central asia . 
tajik authorities are not disclosing the true nature of the operation in the rashta valley to prevent panic among people who are still getting over the horrors of the civil war . 
representatives of tajik power structures will only say that the situation in the rashta valley is under the close control of the tajik authorities . 
tajik media organisations stand up for journalists ,  freedom of speech
the possibility of openly criticising authorities in print or broadcast is an inalienable right of journalists in democratic countries-a right given to them by readers .

tajikistan - a joint statement expressing concern over the criminal prosecution of independent journalist ozodbek khosabekov was released recently by the tajik journalists union ,  the national association of independent media ,  the media alliance and the foundation for the memory and defence of journalists rights .

last june ,  the journalist was tried ,  found guilty and sentenced to <num>200</num>  hours of mandatory labour . 
since then ,  the independent journalist has made efforts to appeal the lower courts decision to defend his right to freedom of expression . 
the superior court and the tajik prosecutor general recently indicated that they will consider his appeal . 
<num>200,000</num>  tajiks take part in national running day
national running day is becoming increasingly popular in tajikistan from year to year . 
dushanbe - on may <num>17</num>  , a sunny sunday ,  around <num>200,000</num>  tajiks took part in national running day . 
everyone from civil servants to former athletes ,  schoolchildren to students ,  and diplomats to disabled people took part in the mass run .

tajikistan devalues national currency

 ( photo by bay ismoyo / afp / getty images ) 
tajikistan - the national bank of tajikistan devalued the somoni ,  the national currency ,  on may <num>19</num>  .
it lost nearly three percent of its value against the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar on the first day and has fallen <num>6.4</num>  percent since then . 
exchange offices in dushanbe on may <num>21</num>  were paying <num>4.40</num>  - <num>4.45</num>  somoni per dollar and <num>5.70</num>  - <num>5.75</num>  per euro . 
they were only buying ;  sales of foreign currency to the public were frozen by the countrys banks at the start of the year . 
head of social and labour market research at tajikistans strategic research centre firuz saidov said the value of the national currency would continue to fall until the end of the summer . 
he expects the value of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar to grow <num>15</num>  percent more on average and be worth five somoni by that time . 
saidov said the drop in the somoni during the financial crisis ,  especially in the spring ,  is a natural process . 
the foreign currency gains against the somoni slightly every spring as the flow of migrant workers outside the country grows ,  he said . 
the exchange rates remain high until migrant workers began sending the first money back from abroad . 
in the current situation ,  the reasons for the devaluation of the tajik currency include a drop in the prices of and demand for its main export products ,  aluminium and cotton ,  and a drop in the national currencies of tajikistans key trading partners ,  russia and kazakhstan . 
saidov said the negative impact which these processes have had on the economy is already fairly noticeable with the rise in the prices for consumer goods on the domestic market . 
saidov believes the national currency will begin recovering in september .

troops were engaged in street battles with militants in mingora ,  the gateway into the valley . 
the ground offensive in mingora is part of the military's efforts to flush out the taliban from areas in the north-west frontier province . 
the militants have long controlled vast swaths of the province ,  imposing their own fundamentalist interpretation of islamic law . 
muhummad ayaz ,  a mingora shopkeeper who fled the city ,  told cnn that all its shops and markets are closed . 
he said that many homes left vacant by fleeing residents are being used by the taliban as shelter and as bases ,  and that taliban terrorists armed with heavy weaponry could be seen on some streets and in some market areas . 
according to ayaz ,  pakistani gunships were firing into mingora and the army controlled all entrances into the city . 
the army was also providing a little food to people at the entrance checkpoints ,  ayaz added . 
ayaz fled mingora northward toward khwazakhela ,  telling cnn he saw abandoned taliban caves in the mountains along the way .

on may <num>20</num>  , uzbekistan sharply cut its natural gas shipments to neighbouring tajikistan ,  pushing the country to the brink of yet another energy crisis . 
the precipitous decrease in gas deliveries of <num>400,000</num>  cubic metres per day is a direct consequence of debts that tajikistan owes tashkent .

tajikgaz deputy director shavkat shoimov announced that the arrears now total us$14 million ,  <num>10.3</num>  $  million of which was borrowed from uzbekistan by tajik state energy company barki tochik . 
uztransgaz has sold tajikistan <num>103</num>  million cubic metres so far this year ,  a <num>56</num>  percent reduction from <num>2008</num>  , while the price of the gas has shot up from <num>150</num>  $  per thousand cubic metres to <num>240</num>  $  this year .

pakistan government struggles to reduce budget deficit
islamabad - about <num>125</num>  projects have been removed from the public sector development programme  ( psdp )  and over <num>400</num>  others are facing implementation delays because the government is trying to reduce spending and limit the budget deficit to <num>4.2</num>  percent of the gross domestic product  ( gdp )  . 
sources at the finance ministry said on may <num>28</num>  that the government has set the deficit target for <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  at us$7 . 25 billion ,  which is <num>4.2</num>  percent of the gdp . 
it will need <num>4.38</num>  $  billion from external sources and <num>2.65</num>  $  billion from internal sources to fund the deficit . 
the size of the proposed development budget is to be slashed to about <num>7</num>  $  billion as agreed to with the international monetary fund  ( imf )  at the last dubai talks when the fund raised the fiscal deficit target for pakistan from <num>3.4</num>  to <num>4.6</num>  percent ,  sources added .

deputy chairman of the planning commission sardar asif ahmed ali said it asked for <num>10.3</num>  $  billion from ministries and departments for development projects ,  but due to financial constraints the annual plan coordination committee has decided to focus on already ongoing development projects . 
only us$1 . 3 billion will be available for new projects ,  and the allocation of <num>312.5</num>  $  million for the earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation authority may also be included in that amount .

officials acted after pakistani taliban leaders warned of more bomb attacks in cities in retaliation for a government offensive in the north-west . 
authorities in peshawar have banned public gatherings a day after at least <num>10</num>  people died in two separate attacks . 
the taliban leader is the architect of a nearly two-year uprising in the swat valley aimed at enforcing sharia law .

a supporter of presidential candidate mir hossein mousavi holds up a campaign poster during a rally in tehran may <num>30</num>  .
tehran - irans urban middle class is increasingly disenchanted with the current government and may turn out in numbers larger than four years ago to oppose president mahmoud ahmadinejad . 
i never voted for anybody because i dont like this system ,  said faranak ,  a tehran housewife who asked not to be further identified . 
but this time ,  i will bring my entire family to vote for one of the opponents of ahmadinejad . 
leili rashidi ,  a well-known iranian actress said that four more years of ahmadinejad would be disastrous . 
the middle class is decaying under this government ,  she said .

the middle classes who didnt vote four years ago now feel what a calamity has befallen us . 
i dont think the people are as stupid to repeat their error ,  rashidi said

a man holds a genuine  ( l )  and a fake mobile phone side by side at the start of the high level conference on counterfeiting and piracy in brussels . 
karachi - china-made knock-offs of globally famous mobile phone brands are rapidly grabbing market share in pakistan . 
replica mobile phones are available at throw away prices in all major markets in pakistan ,  said wholesale dealer mohammad suleman . 
we are selling china-made pirated hand-sets at <num>30</num>  to <num>40</num>  percent of the retail prices of name brand phones ,  suleman asserted . 
nokia ,  samsung ,  ericsson ,  lg ,  motorola and blackberry replicas are available in bulk across the country . 
i bought a knock-off samsung <num>808</num>  for only us$50 while the real thing costs between <num>112</num>  $  to <num>125</num>  $  , said riaz ahmed . 
and shopkeepers are actually giving one-year warranties on the pirated hand-sets to attract customers . 
pakistan has imported <num>4</num>  $  billion worth of mobile phones and accessories in the last two years ,  a third of which are fakes from china ,  dealers said . 
importers are bringing pirated mobile phones and accessories from china by concealing them in consignments of genuine china-made sets and accessories ,  according to dealers . 
neither the pakistan government nor officials from the pakistan telecommunication authority ,  the regulatory body ,  are taking any action against the free trade of pirated mobile phones and accessories in the country ,  dealers said . 
nokia has repeatedly requested the government curb the import and trade of pirated hand-sets ,  but no action has been taken ,  said fahim ahmed ,  who is handling media affairs for the company . 
multinational companies like nokia ,  samsung ,  ericsson ,  lg and motorola are suffering losses in the millions of dollars every year because of the sale of pirated chinese hand-sets ,  he added . 
nokia is the major victim of piracy ,  because it is the market leader with a <num>65</num>  percent share of the mobile phone market .

cairo - quoting from the quran for emphasis ,  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama called for a new beginning between the united states and muslims and said that together they could confront violent extremism across the globe and advance the search for peace in the middle east . 
this cycle of suspicion and discord must end ,  obama said june <num>4</num>  during a widely anticipated speech in one of the worlds largest muslim countries ,  intended to reframe relations after the terrorist attacks of <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
the white house said obamas speech contained no new policy proposals on the middle east . 
the president said <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ties with israel are unbreakable ,  yet issued a firm ,  evenhanded call to the jewish state and palestinians alike to live up to their international obligations . 
obamas remarks drew a positive response from corners of the world not given to complimenting the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> 
in iran ,  mohammad ali abtahi ,  a cleric who was vice president under reformist president mohammad khatami ,  said ,  this can be an initial step for removing misconceptions between  [ the ]  world of islam and the west . 
obama spoke at cairo university after meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak on the second stop of a four-nation trip to the middle east and europe . 
the president said the actions of violent extremist muslims are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings ,  and quoted the quran to make his point saying ,  be conscious of god and always speak the truth .

kunar graduates find <num>100</num>  percent employment
 ( photo by inge fryklund ) 
some <num>140</num>  students recently completed a three-month course at the new centre in shigal district . 
they were taught valuable trades including painting ,  electrical work ,  plumbing ,  masonry ,  steel bending ,  and carpentry . 
the idea behind the centre is to provide local men with training and skills to improve their employment opportunities and reduce the number of workers having to be hired from pakistan . 
companies in kunar normally bring in skilled labourers from pakistan or nangarhar to work on their projects because of the lack of professional labour available in kunar . 
about <num>45</num>  construction companies attended the ceremony to make job offers to the eager graduates . 
demand was so strong that the contractors requests for workers exceeded the total number of graduates . 
i am very happy that after gradation i got a professional job . 
i will work in a construction company ,  which will pay me a good salary ,  he said . 
governor said fazlullah wahidi congratulated the graduates ,  saying it is essential that young men in kunar have employment opportunities . 
the school was established with support from the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  agency for international developments  ( usaid )  ,  kunar provincial reconstruction team  ( prt )  ,  and the local government . 
part of its operating costs will be recovered through the materials testing laboratory that will function on a fee-for-service basis . 
meanwhile in kunars volatile security environment ,  the school has no immediate security problems . 
all graduates receive a certificate of achievement and a starter toolkit . 
he told the graduates ,  yesterday skilled labour came from pakistan . 
today it comes from kunar . 
you represent the best hope for rebuilding this country . 
south-eastern europe and central asia are experiencing serious water shortages . 
 ( photo by joe raedle / getty images ) 
the effects of climate change will be more significant in the european and central asian region than was earlier thought ,  according to a world bank report presented at a un conference on climate change in bonn . 
europe and central asia are suffering from an inability to adapt to climate change ,  said marianna fay ,  the director of the group that prepared the world development <num>2010</num>  report and author of the new world bank report adaptation to climate chang in europe and central asia . 
judging from climatic predictions ,  the climates volatility will only increase in the coming decade ,  she said . 
these countries are becoming painfully vulnerable to the effect of even insignificant changes in the climate . 
climate change has worsened the effects of a difficult legacy of the soviet past ,  when economic growth targets were met through a flagrant disregard for the environment . 
if water was needed to irrigate a field ,  the flow of rivers that feed the aral sea was rerouted to the desert to grow rice ,  fruit and cotton . 
uzbekistan became the worlds largest cotton exporter but at the cost of the loss of the aral seas resources ,  the report notes . 
little has changed since soviet times . 
tajikistan's national bank no longer responsible for national currency exchange rate
observers are not ruling out the closure of a number of tajik currency exchange offices . 
 ( photo by vanderlei almeida / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - amendments to tajikistan's law on the national bank of tajikistan  ( nbt )  make it no longer responsible for controlling the rate of exchange of the national currency ,  the somoni ,  although it will intervene in the event of unwarranted market price increases . 
as noted by nbt chairman sharif rakhimzod ,  in the last five months the somoni has dropped <num>20</num>  percent against the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar while prices throughout the country have increased by only one percent . 
additionally ,  as noted by experts ,  the nbt does not have sufficient resources today to intervene in the foreign exchange market . 
all currency exchange transactions in the capital were frozen . 
on june <num>1</num>  , the bank revoked the licences of all currency exchange offices . 
observers are not ruling out the possibility that a number of currency exchange offices will not reopen ,  as has been the case in many central asian countries . 
the amended nbt law calls for all future national bank revenue to be transferred to the government budget . 
until now ,  part of its revenues remained at the bank's disposal . 
in addition ,  the nbt will no longer provide guarantees to foreign creditors for financing of the private sector ,  with the exception of commercial banks . 
the government's control over the bank will also be strengthened . 
the nbt chairman will now be appointed by the nation's president for a term of seven years ,  his deputies for five years and the board members for four years . 
prior to the amendments to the nbt law ,  such terms limits were not set .

the opposition claimed that on may <num>29</num>  an issue of the aigai newspaper and property of the social democratic party had been confiscated in the village of bosteri . 
leaders of the ata meken socialist party who arrived for the congress on may <num>30</num>  then said they were subjected to attacks by instigators and thugs despite the presence of police officers nearby . 
subsequently ,  social democratic party deputy kubanychbek kadyrov said that he was attacked by the local police chief ,  ernis duishembiyev ,  in the police station in tyupski district . 
topping it all off ,  on may <num>31</num>  , <num>150</num>  people attacked the regional office of the social democratic party and broke down a fence ,  kicked in the door and smashed windows . 
opposition leaders otunbayev ,  tekenbayev and kadyrov were in the office at the time ,  as were social democratic party and ata meken activists . 
when they accused karakol prosecutor kuban irisbayev of organising the attack ,  members of the state national security committee ordered the politicians out of the region in retaliation . 
ombudsman akun argued that local officials and some power structures exceeded their authorities and blatantly violated the human rights of opposition political leaders and activists . 
according to akun ,  the events in issyk kul were nothing more than gross violations of the human right to assemble peacefully and speak freely <abbr>…</abbr>  those guilty of violating the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens should be subject to legal and appropriate punishment ,  he said .

kazakhstan - on may <num>30</num>  , the kymyzmuryndyk festival was held in almatys national palace square to celebrate kumys ,  the kazakh drink made from fermented horses milk . 
endeavouring to preserve kazakh traditions and cuisine ,  the organisers modelled the revival of the ancient festival on events such as germanys oktoberfest beer festival and japanese tea ceremonies to promote its becoming an annual event to mark the onset of the summer season . 
as nursila akhmetber ,  president of the kumys centre ,  said ,  after all ,  when the weather was hot ,  kazakhs would drink <num>10</num>  to <num>15</num>  litres of kumys a day . 
kymyzmuryndyk is an ancient holiday when kazakhs celebrated the first horse milking . 
horses milk not only helps prevent tuberculosis and diabetes ,  it has more vitamins and acids than any other drink ,  said president of the kazakh academy of nutrition ,  toregeldy sharmanov . 
history professor gali azimbai said that kumys could become a tourist attraction and a strong national export . 
despite the ambitions of kumys enthusiasts ,  the drink has not yet become a national brand ,  largely because it is difficult to preserve . 
even when refrigerated ,  it stays fresh for only three to five days .

in april of last year ,  residents of a dushanbe district designated to be torn down held a meeting to protest the action . 
authorities broke up the demonstration and arrested <num>20</num>  people who were involved in it . 
in <num>2007</num>  , the dushanbe government announced the implementation of a general city building plan ,  which was developed more than <num>20</num>  years ago . 
human rights advocates contend that citizens' rights have frequently been violated in the process . 
according to the ngo bureau on human rights and rule of law  ( bhrrl )  ,  since february of <num>2007</num>  , <num>220</num>  people who were subjected to forced eviction have approached its legal office for assistance .

he maintained that the two percent gdp growth rate was reasonable in the wake of the global economic meltdown . 
the war on terror has weakened the economy as it triggered the economic slowdown and uncertainty that caused a blow to foreign investment and tax collection as well ,  tarin said . 
he noted that the large-scale manufacturing sector declined by <num>7.7</num>  percent ,  while agriculture ,  livestock and foreign trade showed lesser declines than estimated in the current financial year . 
he pointed out that per capita income grew by <num>0.3</num>  percent and would increase to us$1 , 046 per capita by june <num>30</num>  .
the pakistan government averted the threat of default through credit arrangements with the imf ,  multilateral donor agencies and friends of democratic pakistan . 
in next five years pakistan will receive us$18 billion to <num>20</num>  $  billion worth of additional economic assistance to stabilise the crisis-hit economy ,  tarin said . 
the government should also take steps to reduce the rate of inflation and the mark-up rate to provide relief to the people and to reduce the cost of doing business ,  he opined . 
he also said that victory against terrorism would ensure smooth growth of the economy and attract foreign investment ;  objectives he acknowledged will not be reached for some time . 
criminals and extremists seek to impose influence on schools asserts kyrgyz president
kyrgyzstan's president is proposing educational reforms to meet modern challenges . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan-on june <num>10</num>  , kyrgyzstan president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  during a speech at a government meeting regarding a new approach to educational reform ,  spoke of the growing influence of criminals and extremist movements on schoolchildren and students . 
bakiyev proposed to reform the educational system pending his re-election next month . 
the kyrgyz leader noted that ignoring the need for educational reform will sharply worsen the condition and future of the state and society in a rapidly changing world . 
sweeping changes in the labour market and global competition demand it ,  he asserted . 
the president also noted that the principle guide for all developed nations is the building of a system of education that gives individuals the opportunity to learn and to increase and change their qualifications throughout their working lives . 
only in such a system will people be able to adjust to shifting economic circumstances . 
the president ,  however ,  noted that in kyrgyzstan this task has not been considered as one of the principle tasks of reform . 
bakiyev stated that new threats have appeared which were precluded in the soviet educational system . 
the criminal world and extremist movements have made the schools a target for their influence ,  posing a threat which must be answered before it is too late . 
republic authorities have already indirectly acknowledged that secular authorities are losing influence with schoolchildren . 
the chief administrator of osh has gone so far as to declare a ban on students attending the traditional noontime friday prayer ,  for which they had to cut classes . 
with respect to crime ,  kyrgyzstan is considered one of the most crime-ridden countries in central asia and the situation in its jails has long been considered uncontrollable . 
in the president's opinion ,  child and teen crime is flourishing in schools and adding to crime statistics . 
educational reform is necessary to answer this challenge . 
bakiyev said increasing the level of security and competitive ability of the nation depends in many ways on the success of educational reform . 
kyrgyzstan attempts to build barrier against harmful food products
kyrgyzstan does not currently have equipment that can identify the presence of harmful substances in food products . 
 ( photo by miguel rojo / afp / getty images ) 
the bill was proposed by a group of deputies who are concerned that harmful food products containing heavy metals and their compounds are being sold in kyrgyzstan . 
the kyrgyz ministry of economic development and trade oppose the bill . 
according to minister anylbek zhaparov ,  banning the import of food products may be seen as discriminating against imports and erecting trade barriers . 
according to the ministry ,  food products imported at all entry points on the national border undergo mandatory phyto-sanitary and sanitary-epidemiological inspection . 
if substances harmful to human health are found in food products ,  they can be seized and destroyed . 
in the past <num>10</num>  years ,  however ,  there has not been a single such case . 
in opposing the bill ,  the ministry emphasises that aspects of it could affect kyrgyzstan's trade relations with other countries and international organisations . 
ministry experts note that any restrictions imposed should be agreed to with the world trade organisation . 
ecological organisations also acknowledge that the current methods of judging the quality of imported products are out of date . 
there are no checks for carcinogenic substances ,  banned food additives and genetically modified products . 
 " this is a serious problem for kyrgyzstan ,  considering its broad transit trade and the lack of barriers to protect citizens from harmful food products "  ,  said ilya domasheev ,  an official with the ecological organisation biom .

a strong earthquake hit south-east kazakhstan late in the evening of june <num>13</num>  .
its epicentre was near tekeli in the almaty region <num>230</num>  kilometres north-east of almaty . 
at the epicentre the shocks measured <num>5.5</num>  points on the richter scale . 
according to preliminary assessments ,  hundreds of residents were left without shelter . 
underground shocks were felt in taldykorgan and in almaty . 
lesser shocks were also recorded in kyrgyzstan . 
the most seriously damaged buildings in tekeli were three two-story eight-flat residential buildings built in <num>1949</num>  , a home for the elderly ,  a private hotel ,  a sports facility and high school no .  <num>1</num>  .
the school was set to undergo major renovations including seismic retro-fitting . 
almost <num>300</num>  residential one-story privately owned homes also suffered varying degress of damage . 
over the past few days ,  almost <num>250</num>  statements from victims asking authorities for assistance have been received by the city administration . 
a republic commission ,  which includes experts from the national institute of seismology and other republic and regional agencies ,  will assess the damage . 
attracting investment in the tajik economy
according to badriddin safarov ,  a leading expert in investment and state property management ,  during the first three months of this year the different branches of the tajik economy received over <num>110</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  of direct investment . 
this is three times the amount invested over the same period in <num>2007</num>  .
in particular ,  safarov remarked that most of the investment was channelled into the development of hydroelectricity and construction . 
the construction site for the sangtuda hydroelectric power station
tajikistans first deputy minister of finance ,  sherali safarov ,  confirmed that ,  over the next three years ,  once these electricity and transport projects have been completed ,  the countrys economic growth indices will double . 
current economic growth is at the level of <num>7</num> -<num>7.5</num>  percent per year . 
by bringing online a series of large hydroelectric power stations and opening some new highways that will ,  in future ,  provide a link to the sea ports of south asia ,  tajikistan should increase its trade turnover and hence its domestic production . 
according to abdugafor rakhmonov ,  deputy minister of economic development and trade ,  the growth in investment is conditional on investors being exempt from the obligation to pay certain taxes and customs duties ,  which their involvement in hydroelectricity ,  light industry and hotel construction projects would otherwise require . 
it was this exemption which led to the building of four <num>5</num> -star hotels currently underway in tajikistans capital using foreign investment and companies . 
rakhmonov commented that most investment in this sector comes from indian and russian companies and from the aga khan fund . 
most of these resources go to the construction and repair of highways and high voltage electricity transmission lines . 
shoimov pointed out that ,  under provisional agreements between the tajik government and its donors ,  international financial institutions and donor countries will ,  between <num>2009</num>  and <num>2011</num>  , allocate in the range of <num>400</num>  $  million to the development of tajikistans economy . 
timurali afgonov ,  head of the finance ministrys main department for government debt and financial assets ,  believes the annual economic growth rate and the financial condition of the state budget will allow the country to take out additional foreign loans for the development of the national economy and the implementation of economic programmes . 
the european union and international financial institutions provide tajikistan with technical aid in the amount of <num>1</num>  $  million for the implementation of a project to create a single window . 
under this project ,  it will take a mere four days to draw up all the documents that a legal entity is obliged to submit . 
this virtually eliminates the bureaucratic obstacles and administrative red tape . 
in the course of his annual parliamentary address at the end of april ,  the tajik president ,  emomali rakhmon ,  tasked the relevant government bodies with suspending official checks on small and medium business for two years so as to encourage the development of entrepreneurial activity . 
analysts confirm that the implementation of these plans will encourage business development in tajikistan and help attract additional investment in the economy ,  which will in turn allow it a period of stable growth . 
as a result ,  the state treasury will receive additional funds in the form of taxes ,  and more new jobs will be created in the employment market . 
afghan heroin seized in northern tajikistan
a total of <num>268.7</num>  kilograms of narcotics ,  more than half of which was heroin ,  has been seized in sughd province so far this year . 
 ( photo by reuters / nozim kalandarov ) 
when the nca response team officers arrived on the scene ,  the two drug couriers abandoned their load and fled to kyrgyzstan under cover of darkness . 
the operation led to the discovery near the sixty years of kyrgyzstan settlement in batken province of a motorcycle laden with four bags containing <num>100</num>  cellophane-wrapped packets of heroin weighing a total of <num>100.3</num>  kilograms . 
the packets bore symbols and stamps indicating that the heroin had been produced in afghanistan . 
the owners of the haul have been identified and efforts are now being made to arrest them . 
a total of <num>268.7</num>  kilograms of drugs ,  including <num>140.7</num>  kilograms of heroin ,  has been seized over the first five months of <num>2009</num>  in sughd province . 
a source in the tajik ministry of internal affairs  ( mia )  says that virtually half of the inhabitants of sughd province are in some way involved in illegal drug-dealing . 
this has to do with the proximity of afghanistan ,  and also the fact that there are virtually no jobs in the region . 
those who were able to go to russia have found work there ;  the rest have been forced to earn a living from drug-smuggling ,  the mia source stated . 
change comes to iran :  has the counter-revolution begun ? 
protesters march in central tehran in a silent demonstration against the results of the iranian presidential election on june <num>18</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
among the most telling signs of this phenomenon is the open dispute between ahmadinejad and his predecessors ,  mohammad khatami and hashemi rafsanjani . 
ahmadinejad has accused rafsanjani of both corruption and of supporting mir-hossein moussavi ,  ahmadinejads opponent in the recent election . 
overwhelming popular movements have taken to the streets and have not retreated in the face of oppressive security forces ,  including the regimes militia ,  known as the basij . 
the protests serve to underscore the great unrest on the iranian street . 
the public has come to ignore its governments decisions ,  prohibitions and warnings ,  even those issued by the highest authority in the country ,  supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .

dushanbe - on june <num>12</num>  , a department to treat a multi-drug resistant form of tuberculosis opened at the republic clinical tuberculosis hospital machiton . 
director of the republic tuberculosis treatment centre saidullo saidaliyev said the german development bank provided more than us$1 million to build the facility ,  and the un global fund provided <num>300,000</num>  $  for the purchase of equipment and furniture . 
the department will offer up to <num>80</num>  people inpatient treatment for a multi-drug resistant form of tuberculosis resistant to antibiotics and very difficult to treat . 
according to saleban omar ,  of the global fund to fight hiv / aids ,  that form of tuberculosis developed after the ussr dissolved and active attempts to fight it ceased in the tajikistan health care system . 
he estimated that almost <num>3,000</num>  people are infected with it . 
for the majority of tajiks who live under the poverty line ,  a tuberculosis diagnosis is equivalent to a death sentence . 
every year ,  almost <num>3,000</num>  new patients are registered in the country and the mortality rate increased to almost <num>400</num>  in <num>2008</num>  .
the number of tajikistanis currently registered in the republic tuberculosis health centre totals almost <num>15,500</num>  .
despite the measures taken ,  the situation ,  especially in rural regions ,  leaves something to be desired . 
in hamadoni ,  <num>77</num>  first cases have already been registered while there were only <num>29</num>  in <num>2008</num>  .
in hovalinge ,  the number jumped from two people in <num>2008</num>  , to <num>24</num>  registered cases so far this year .

lahore - al-qaeda will use pakistans nuclear weapons against the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  if they get them ,  al-qaeda commander of operations in afghanistan mustafa abu al-yazid said in an interview with al-jazeera on june <num>21</num>  .
god willing ,  the nuclear weapons will not fall into the hands of the americans and the mujahideen will take them and use them against the americans ,  he said . 
we expect that the pakistan army will be defeated  [ in swat ]  ,  and that would be its end everywhere ,  god willing . 
since then ,  the pakistan military has been battling al-qaedas taliban allies and has claimed significant success in the ongoing operation . 
the interview was made as international concerns over the safety of pakistans nuclear arsenal increased amid growing insurgency across the country . 
but pakistani president asif ali zardari continues to reassure the international community that his military has a strong command-and-control system for its nuclear weapons .

the security forum ,  the theme of which is security through partnership ,  was an informal space for the free and open discussion of issues of regional and global security ,  said kazakh foreign ministry official erzhan ashikbaev . 
russian representative to nato dmitry rogozin ,  who is known for his lively metaphors and imaginative statements ,  accused nato of attempting to destroy a family .

president gurbanguly berdimuhammedov has ,  virtually since the very first days of his presidency ,  proclaimed the need to bring the states finance policies in line with accepted norms . 
once the necessary know-how was developed with respect to the imminent policy reform ,  implementation began in spring <num>2008</num>  .
a series of bank branches were opened where ordinary citizens could exchange the national currency for <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollars and vice versa .

kazakhstan to hold extraordinary parliamentary elections
the seventeenth session of the parliamentary assembly of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe  ( osce pa )  is being held in kazakhstan . 
this is the first session of the european security organisations parliamentary assembly to be held in central asia and it is taking place in astana . 
in november <num>2007</num>  , kazakhstan was elected to chair the osce for <num>2010</num>  .
nevertheless ,  a number of western countries ,  members of the osce ,  felt it necessary to demand that astana bring some aspects of its domestic policy in line with western attitudes . 
first and foremost ,  this concerned kazakhstans single-chamber parliament ,  which was last elected in august <num>2007</num>  .
nazarbaev addresses the osce parliamentary assembly
for this reason ,  the current session of the osce assembly was supposed to be a kind of moment of truth for the kazakhstani government ,  which was supposed to establish how prepared the country was in reality to head an influential european organization . 
nazarbaev's statement was a serious indication of kazakhstan's readiness to embark on the road to reform . 
the president made it clear that astana was also ready to carry out a series of other obligations which accompany the right to head the osce . 
the kazakhstani head of state described these as the  " creation of more favourable conditions for official registration of political parties ,  betterment of electoral legislation and procedures ,  and dismantlement of unnecessary barriers regulating the media .  " 
in other words ,  nazarbaev promised to simplify the registration of opposition parties ,  make the electoral process more transparent and ensure genuine press freedom . 
together ,  this can be regarded as the main outcome of the osce pa in kazakhstan . 
in addition ,  it is likely that the bar on parties with support of between five and seven percent of the vote from entering parliament will be removed ,  and a single-party parliament will no longer be permitted . 
commenting on the course of the osce's parliamentary assembly ,  dinara bisembina ,  international correspondent with the astana newspaper liter ,  said that the compromise by nazarbaev should persuade kazakhstan's european partners to honour the decision to allow it to chair the osce in <num>2010</num>  .
bisembina was certain that kazakhstan's chairmanship would enable europe to enhance its cooperation with the countries of central asia ,  primarily in the energy sector .

shazia ,  a home-based working woman from islamabad ,  said the government should apply the minimum wages rule to these workers . 
we demand that labour laws should also be applied to these workers and discriminatory laws against women should be repealed .

providing food security programmes in tajikistan
according to gurez bokiev ,  an official from the tajik ministry of finances business sectors department ,  over $20million  [ usd ]  of additional funding has been allocated from the tajik national budget in support of the countrys food production programme for the current year . 
bokiev described these funds as aimed at the development of the farming industry sector and at increasing agricultural production so as to provide the country with a programme of food security . 
deputy minister of agriculture ,  shukrullo rakhminazarov ,  commented that the food production programmes basic emphasis was on increasing grain production ,  growing crops ,  and livestock farming . 
over the last <num>17</num>  years ,  the ministry of agriculture has reduced the amount of land given over to cotton ,  which used to be regarded as a strategic raw material . 
farmers harvesting potatoes
according to bakhoba vakhidov ,  head of the department for the strategic development of the agricultural sector within the ministry of economic development and trades economic research institute ,  the reforms instituted in the agricultural sector are already having positive results . 
indices for the last few years show that grain production has multiplied by a factor of four compared with the early <num>1990</num>  second  . 
information from the state statistics committee suggests that the countrys grain production for <num>2007</num>  came to <num>920,000</num>  tonnes . 
however ,  this is not enough to meet domestic demand ,  and annual wheat imports exceeded <num>600,000</num>  tonnes . 
this year ,  over the january - may period alone ,  approximately <num>80</num>  $  million worth of wheat and flour was imported from neighbouring countries . 
taking into account the rise in food prices and the inflation level ,  the government has called upon farmers to carry out two harvests this year . 
more specifically ,  this is based upon the growth in global flour prices ,  which also affects tajikistan . 
thus ,  if the country is able to produce two harvests a year - which its climate permits - it will be possible to restrict price hikes on food essentials and to reduce the volume of grain imports . 
forecasts suggest that this year over <num>100,000</num>  hectares will be sown with a second crop of grain . 
a poultry farmer in tajikistan
tajikistans deputy minister of agriculture ,  sijovuddin isroilov ,  commented that livestock ,  fish and poultry farming development programmes ,  adopted previously as part of an overall programme to encourage food production ,  yield annual growth of <num>7</num>  percent . 
in some individual categories production has doubled . 
information from the ministry of agriculture suggests that meat and egg production has also increased this year . 
whereas last year there were <num>3</num>  million eggs produced a month ,  this year the figure is <num>6</num>  million . 
this has been made possible thanks to the rehabilitation of poultry farms which were neglected for many years .

tajikistan - tajikistans justice ministry has filed four lawsuits so far this year against international organisations that promote religious beliefs in tajikistan .

the mission distributed materials of a christian religion ,  breaking both tajik laws on social organisations and its own charter ,  which states that it conducts humanitarian activity ,  he said . 
political analyst rustam samiyev commented that such lawsuits in tajikistan after recent passage of a new law on religion may just be for show .

by charging other religions under that law ,  the authorities are trying to show objectivity in its application ,  he said .

according to dilovar butabekov ,  the school's administrator in khorog ,  the scholarship fund has allowed the school to provide knowledge and practical training to one of society's most vulnerable groups . 
 " this is a big step in creating favourable conditions and possibilities for the disabled so that they do not find themselves isolated from society ,  "  butabekov says ,  noting that unemployment among the disabled in the gorno-badakhshan autonomous region in tajikistan reaches as high as <num>90</num>  percent . 
kodir akhrorov ,  an expert in labour issues ,  says tajikstan's disabled face an uphill climb in finding work . 
during the post-war stabilisation period in the late <num>1990</num>  second  ,  the problem of how best to assimilate the disabled into society and the workforce came to the forefront ,  and these issues have not abated since .

this new facility is expected to play a critical role in the social and economic development of the region . 
future profits from the market will be put towards building new warehouses ,  financing the commercial production of construction materials ,  and opening hotels and retail outlets . 
kazakhstan determined to compete with russia for workers
it seems that kazakhstan has begun competing with russia ,  its closest neighbour ,  for qualified professional workers . 
so far ,  the experts from both countries agree that kazakhstan has the upper hand . 
the offers coming from the central asian republic are rather more attractive and it is better at training its own professionals .

after the collapse of the soviet union ,  the fledgling independent republics were faced with an array of problems . 
among them were lower levels of population growth as a result of the poor economic climate and a brain drain abroad . 
it is estimated that about <num>3</num>  million ethnic germans left kazakhstan during the <num>1990</num>  second  and over <num>4</num>  million russians returned to their historical homeland . 
those leaving were members of the middle class and the majority of them were highly qualified professionals . 
the workforce situation adds to the existing problem of  ( inadequate )  natural population growth . 
these have affected both russia and kazakhstan in similar ways . 
however ,  mariam abisheva ,  deputy director of kazakhstans strategic research institute ,  says that the country is coping with the difficulties better ,  although it is yet to match the population growth ,  and overall life expectancy ,  that existed prior to the collapse of the ussr . 
in soviet times both the health service and all quality of life indicators were higher ,  she commented . 
i was fortunate enough to study in moscow for three years under the presidential programme ,  said sergey revyakin ,  a masters graduate of moscow state university and the recipient of a grant from the bolashak programme . 
now that i am about to leave the university i can say that the presidential grants are an invaluable investment in the training of professionals from our republic . 
firstly ,  it means that the young people can live comfortably . 
you can choose your institute and country of study . 
i dont speak english so i had to come and study in russia . 
revyakin said that grant recipients are guaranteed employment upon completion of their studies . 
we are contractually obliged to work in kazakhstan for six years . 
nazarbaevs persistent attention to the bolashak graduates is a great help to us . 
the national agency of government service is headed by gabidulla abrakhimov ,  himself a graduate of the programme . 
fluctuation in labour rates are all it takes to empty out border regions . 
kazakhstan and russia suffer labour shortages equally acute . 
this fluctuation forces moscow and astana to look for a way out of the situation . 
attempts at the cis and eurasian economic community level to resolve the problem of labour migration have not proved successful . 
those countries that provide the workforce ,  including uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzstan and tajikistan ,  claim they want to enter into agreements with the employer-countries ,  but have not signed any relevant documents . 
the workers themselves are happy with the status quo ,  where they send the lions share of their earnings back home . 
this accounts for a significant proportion of the gdp of their home countries . 
at the beginning of <num>2008</num>  , russias federal migration service  ( fms )  established quotas for migrant workers from abroad . 
for the year ,  it is permitted to accept no more than <num>2</num>  million migrant workers -- a third of the number admitted in <num>2007</num>  .
the official motivation for the lower number is that most of the immigrants head for moscow or st petersburg ,  which are not currently in a position to accommodate all those who want to go there . 
kazakhstan ,  on the other hand ,  is encouraging immigration . 
while the russians reduced their quota ,  the kazakhstani government increased theirs so as to entice foreign workers from abroad . 
by government decree ,  the quota for the current year is equivalent to <num>1.6</num>  percent of the republics working population . 
of those ,  <num>0.6</num>  percent are first and second category workers  ( managers and experts with intermediate education )  ;  <num>0.93</num>  percent are in category <num>3</num>   ( skilled professionals )  ;  and <num>0.07</num>  percent are in category <num>4</num>   ( seasonal farm labourers )  . 
in order to calculate the number of workers the quotas would allow ,  its necessary to know how many kazaks are currently employed . 
according to the government ,  that number is about <num>8</num>  million . 
this means kazakhstan is able to accommodate approximately <num>128,000</num>  foreigners . 
kazakh national prosperity fund prepares to shed jobs

unemployment has been rising in kazakhstan since the beginning of the global economic crisis . 
figures from the kazakh statistics agency show that unemployment stood at <num>8</num>  percent between april and june - an increase of <num>1.6</num>  percent in less than a year . 
the job cuts were made mainly in the banking sector but also affected jobs in real estate and small businesses . 
the media ,  too ,  have been hit by the crisis . 
the labour market situation is not hopeless ,  however ,  since there are sectors where qualified staff is always in demand . 
pakistan telecommunication authority curbs illegal telecom business
unlicenced telecom operations severely affect government revenues and the business of legitimate operators in pakistan . 
 ( reuters / athar hussain )

he explained that unlicenced telecom operations severely affect government revenues and the business of legitimate long distance international and local loop operators . 
pakistan sets up community police to thwart taliban

mingora - pakistan has armed and appointed the first community police in swat valley in order to help prevent a taliban resurgence and bolster security forces . 
a semblance of calm has returned to the once lovely swat mountain district more than three months after pakistan ordered its military forces to wage an air and ground assault against taliban fighters who controlled it . 
new swat police chief sajid khan mohmand says the answer lies in his drive to recruit community police ,  particularly as hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians return to the valley ,  hoping that peace will last . 
community police have started to function at local police stations in the valley . 
theyll work alongside regular police and help them deal with militants effectively . 
we have already received <num>1,600</num>  applications ,  mohmand said . 
regular police do not always live in the neighbourhoods in which they work ,  so the community officers should be able to help root out militants who are not part of the community . 
they are chosen for their clean background checks and physical strength by tribal elders ,  and will earn a monthly salary of us$125 dollars . 
retired brigadier and security expert mahmood shah said community policing is the best way to restore peace in swat ,  but he stressed that their success or failure will depend on proper training in policing and counter-insurgency .

karachi university to export flowers
karachi - karachi university will start exporting flowers to the gulf countries next month to generate revenue and promote the research work of staff and students . 
the department of botany at the university is producing several varieties of seasonal and off-season flowers that are in great demand in the gulf countries ,  particularly dubai and abu dhabi ,  professor pirzada qasim raza says . 
our varsity is producing flowers in huge quantities . 
i have asked the staff of the university to establish contacts with the buyers in the gulf countries and start export . 
karachi university ,  with <num>24,000</num>  students ,  would be the first state-run educational institution in pakistan to venture into the flower business . 
karachi university has the capacity to export thousands of kilograms of different kinds of fascinating and colourful flowers on a weekly basis ,  raza added . 
to increase the revenue potential of the endeavour ,  the research work of horticulturalists and students could also be marketed domestically and abroad . 
the pakistan horticulture development board is also establishing model flora farms in various cities to promote the cultivation and export of flowers . 
the <abbr>u.a.e.</abbr>  ,  saudi arabia ,  and e . u .  are its major customers . 
tribute paid to memory of victims of <num>1916</num>  uprising in kyrgyzstan
a railway station in kyrgyzstan ,  which was part of the russian empire ,  can be seen in this <num>1895</num>  photo . 
 ( hulton archive / getty images ) 
the cause of the uprising was the czars edict of mobilisation that compelled males between the ages of <num>19</num>  and <num>43</num>  in the turkestan and steppe regions to work on constructing military defences…in the army field force area on the battle grounds of world war <abbr>i.</abbr> 
the edict called up almost half a million working-aged men of nationalities never before subject to the russian military draft . 
coupled with escalating social problems caused by the appropriation of their best arrable lands by russian settlers ,  the edict gave rise to mass armed demonstrations by kazakhs ,  kyrgyz and uzbeks . 
the most violent fighting occurred in the ferghana valley in eastern kyrgyzstan and south-eastern kazakhstan ,  as well as kazakhstans turgaisk region . 
the anti-government uprising also became clearly anti-russian in nature ,  as many of the local population saw the colonising population as the specific source of their problems . 
as a result ,  many russian villages were destroyed ,  and almost <num>2,000</num>  colonists were killed . 
pakistan's army sent helicopter gunships as reinforcements to combat approximately <num>300</num>  taliban fighters who were attacking bitani's mountain stronghold ,  two intelligence officials said . 
it was impossible to independently confirm the death toll ,  as the fighting was taking place in a remote ,  mountainous area that is off-limits to journalists . 
bitani reported a higher casualty number ,  telling the associated press that a total of about <num>90</num>  fighters were killed and <num>40</num>  houses destroyed . 
washington is increasingly focusing on pakistan's rugged tribal regions ,  as they provide a safe haven for insurgents fighting international forces across the border in afghanistan . 
senior police officer mohammad suleman said that a booby-trapped motorcycle exploded near a frontier corps checkpoint in central quetta ,  and then gunmen on another motorcycle opened fire . 
quetta is the capital of baluchistan ,  where ethnic baluch militants have been waging a low-level insurgency for decades in the impoverished but oil-rich province .

kazakhstan attributes river depletion to china
according to kazakh experts ,  the difference of opinion between kazakhstan and china over water resource sharing is due to the fact that china consumes up to <num>70</num>  percent of water from the border-crossing ili river . 
this has damaged the ecosystems of the ili river and lake balkhash ,  one of the largest reservoirs in kazakhstan ,  and has had a huge environmental and economic impact on the region . 
for many years ,  the water and environmental situation in the ili-balkhash basin has been regarded as extremely precarious ,  and ,  to a certain extent ,  both kazakhstan and china have contributed to making it so ,  the kssi report states . 
it also points out that ,  although both parties say they are aware of the need to improve cooperation in water sharing ,  no real progress has been made to date . 
the kssi points out that a document obliging both parties to share information on the monitoring and use of water resources was signed in december <num>2006</num>  .
in <num>15</num>  years of cooperation ,  however ,  we have not obtained any data on the trans-border ili river ,  the academics said . 
karzai confronts two rivals in broadcast election debate
just hours before official campaigning ended ,  president karzai debated two challengers :  former planning minister ramazan bashardost and a former finance minister ,  ashraf ghani . 
but former foreign minister and presidential candidate abdullah abdullah did not attend ,  denying afghan voters the chance to compare the top two contenders directly . 
the president was relatively subdued in defending the record of his seven years in office . 
he said he believes his experience ,  patience ,  tolerance and vision can be of service to afghanistan for another five years . 
looking ahead ,  the president told afghans that ,  with the strengthening of the country's army ,  the role of the <num>100,000</num>  foreign forces in afghanistan could be reduced . 
karzai thinks that over the next three to <num>10</num>  years ,  operations by nato forces will decline ,  and afghans resume control . 
however ,  he said that in some unstable regions ,  the presence of foreign troops is both needed and welcome . 
bashardost ,  who runs his campaign out of a tent on the side of a highway ,  has surged into third place in the most recent opinion polls of likely voters . 
he contends that he is the ideal candidate to bring about peace because he is a candidate of the people ,  including those who are fighting against the state . 
the french-educated anti-corruption campaigner says all candidates have promised to talk with the taliban ,  but the real question is whether the taliban would agree to communicate with them . 
ghani ,  a former executive of the world bank ,  criticised the karzai administration for putting warlords in power and not bringing about stability ,  despite pouring huge amounts of money into the police force . 
the debate was organised and broadcast by the state tv channel ,  radio free afghanistan and radio azadi . 
pakistan captures spokesman for baitullah mehsud
three intelligence officials said omar was seized in a village in the mohmand tribal region while he was traveling in a car with two associates to south waziristan ,  a taliban stronghold . 
local tribal elders assisted troops in locating omar in the village of khawazeo ,  the intelligence officials said . 
as the official spokesman for the tehrik-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  ,  omar frequently called journalists to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks in pakistan . 
omars capture was the second high-profile arrest of a senior taliban figure this week .

the silvery appeal of turkmenistans women
anyone visiting turkmenistan for the first time would be struck by how unique the country is . 
above all ,  it is the women wearing their traditional national costume and unusual jewellery who give turkmenistan its distinctive colour . 
it is curious that the style of womens clothing ,  like the mens which originated so long ago ,  is so well suited to everyday life and to the climate that it has scarcely changed over the centuries . 
a turkmen bride in traditional dress
silver jewellery ,  like the embroidery ,  is also an integral part of turkmen national dress ,  and it accompanies a woman throughout her life . 
according to legend ,  women used to wear so much jewellery that they could scarcely turn their heads beneath its weight and they were unable to walk without assistance . 
experts believe that the lavish decoration of national dress with items of jewellery became a tradition in this part of the world at least <num>2000</num>  years ago . 
a small silver dome called a gupby with a sharp point is sewn onto the brides shawl or scull-cap . 
from the sides of the dome hang silver discs with numerous pendants . 
the chest of the chabat robe looks as if it has been showered with coins . 
the asyk ,  a decoration to be worn on a womans plait is given to the bride by the grooms mother at the time of the wedding and is worn by the bride ,  as she prepares to become a mother ,  until the birth of her first son . 
he explains by saying that it has to be admitted that the main trend in contemporary sets of jewellery is a heightened complexity in the chest adornment ,  which is made up of moving but linked parts . 
the general form of the traditional gulyka and other items is preserved ,  but they are made lighter ,  using new ornamentation derived from the centuries of tradition ,  and keeping the indispensable pendants - the shelpe .

pakistan is the worlds fourth-largest cotton producer . 
cotton and cotton textiles make up over <num>60</num>  percent of the nations total exports . 
the cultivation area sown with cotton plants grew to <num>3.2</num>  million hectares this year ,  up from <num>2.8</num>  million last year . 
the recent rains are helping to wash away some pests for now ,  but if the rainy spell persists for more than another three or four days ,  it could hurt output by accelerating the spread of  [ water-bourne ]  pests and the cotton leaf curl virus  ( clcv )  ,  said usman . 
the punjab agriculture ministry  ( pam )  has directed its pest experts to be on the alert for signs of infestation ,  and has also ordered them to remain on location to personally monitor the situation . 
in addition ,  cotton and textile products experts recently urged the government to ensure that national research institutions have the capacity to provide cutting-edge technology to respond to any situation that may affect the cotton crop ,  as well as implement steps to develop higher yield local cotton seed varieties . 
kazakhstan convicts men responsible for ordnance explosions

kazakhstan - a district court in a south kazakhstan province convicted five senior employees of a branch of the kazarsenal research and manufacturing association in connection with ordnance explosions at a site owned by the company . 
the incident occurred on march <num>20</num>  , two kilometres from arys ,  a town with a population of more than <num>65,000</num>  .
three people were killed by the series of explosions that occurred following the outbreak of a fire at a manufacturing site belonging to kazarsenal . 
between <num>17</num>  and <num>29</num>  employees sought medical treatment as a result . 
it was initially reported that munitions warehouses belonging to the kazakh armed forces had exploded . 
province governor askar mirzahmetov stated that the incident had occurred outside a military installation on the premises of a private ordnance disposal company . 
one was sentenced to four years imprisonment ,  while the other two were sentenced to three years imprisonment at penal colonies . 
pursuant to the courts decision ,  all three were banned from occupying senior posts in the manufacturing sector for three years . 
the branchs deputy logistics director and occupational safety and health engineer were also found guilty of breaching safety regulations . 
they were given two-year suspended sentences with probation .

bta chairman mukhtar ablyazov left kazakhstan soon after the government bought shares in the bank at the start of the year under a memorandum signed by the government and shareholders ,  due to the risk of default . 
the prosecutor general also accused the banker of misappropriating us$550 , 000
the financial regulatory agency found a discrepancy in the books at alliance bank that offered the state the controlling interest at the start of the year for a symbolic price of less than one <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar . 
the bank provided guarantees for fictitious contracts worth <num>1.1</num>  $  billion that were funneled into offshore accounts . 
bakhmutova said the agency knew which measures were needed to prevent fraud . 
bank decisions should not be made by one individual ,  but by a board ,  and naturally ,  banks and financial organisations must have normal risk management systems in place . 
unified national testing in kazakhstan
in kazakhstan they prepare thoroughly for the unified national testing
for all those graduating from school in kazakhstan ,  the abbreviation unt stands for unified national testing-the examination that takes place practically simultaneously across the entire country . 
it is said that all who want to receive a higher education pray to the letters unt . 
unt was introduced for the first time in <num>2004</num>  as a form of a unified ,  combined examination for completing secondary education and entering a university . 
school graduates in kazakhstan
since <num>2008</num>  , certain changes have been made in the system for administering unt . 
it now includes five subjects :  mathematics ,  history ,  russian or kazakh language ,  and a subject of choice  ( english ,  french ,  german ,  physics ,  chemistry ,  geography ,  biology )  . 
each subject includes <num>25</num>  test pieces and the time allowed is three hours . 
the results are valid only for the year in which the test is given . 
the primary aim in introducing the unt is to reduce the corruption associated with university admission . 
not everyone in kazakhstan has a positive assessment of the unt . 
there are opinions that centralisation monopolises the corruption ,  and there are even those who think that the test questions have been compiled incorrectly . 
the procedure for conducting the unt is being constantly improved . 
changes are made every year ,  connected with the fact that experience is gained in conducting the tests and preparing the test problems . 
it is expected that by <num>2010</num>  there will be a new system for conducting the unt . 
president karzai and abdullah abdullah claim victory in afghan election
western diplomats appealed to both candidates to keep their supporters in line and said they were pleased at the responsible attitude both had adopted . 
the start of the muslim fasting month of ramadan has helped calm tensions in the absence of an official result . 
election observers said that just holding an election in afghanistan was a success . 
the ballot took place in a country at war ,  with little history of democracy and deep ethnic divisions . 
un special representative kai eide was similarly positive ,  despite the fact that it was the most complicated election he had seen anywhere in the world . 
international observer missions including teams from the eu and the international republican institute said the vote had been  " credible "  and  " generally fair .  " 
security sources said that the haqqani network and hezb-i-islami ,  insurgent factions allied with the taliban ,  were unable to conduct the kind of wholesale violence that security sources had feared . 
if the iec declares karzai the winner after one round ,  low turnout in the south may in fact enhance his legitimacy by showing him to be a leader capable of appealing to voters nationwide . 
karzai draws much of his support from the pashtun ethnic group ,  which is spread predominantly across the south and east of afghanistan . 
at the latest meeting of the republic government devoted to energy questions ,  the prime minister of kazakhstan ,  karim masimov ,  devoted a great deal of attention to questions of making active use of renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar power . 
in his opinion ,  with the increased demand for electric power and the adoption of measures to increase the attractiveness of investments ,  wind power in kazakhstan may become a powerful energy source . 
kazakhstan consults experts from various countries in the world
project proon :  kazakhstan initiative to develop the wind energy market is now being implemented in the republic jointly with the kazakhstan ministry of energy and mineral resources . 
the project is aimed at drawing up a national programme to develop wind energy ,  and also to create the necessary legislative basis . 
a package of laws drawn up by project experts is now being reviewed by the government of kazakhstan . 
within the framework of the project ,  <num>10</num>  investment packages have been prepared to attract potential investors to build wind energy farms . 
in some regions of kazakhstan special masts have been set up to evaluate wind potential
in general ,  the potential for wind energy is several times greater than the demand for electric power in the republic . 
so from wind energy alone we are capable of meeting our demand ,  both now and taking into account the further development of the country ,  says gennadiy doroshin ,  the manager of project proon . 
there are future plans to increase the number of such sites . 
a wind atlas for kazakhstan will be compiled from the results of these studies ,  and this will contain the information needed to develop projects . 
it will be freely available and will serve to develop wind energy in kazakhstan . 
the environmental factor is another important benefit of developing wind energy in kazakhstan . 
the power engineering industry in kazakhstan is one of the dirtiest in the world ,  because it is based on coal and obsolete technology ,  doroshin said . 
today there is a real problem in the world associated with climate change ,  the consequence of throwing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere . 
in terms of volumes of emission of such gases kazakhstan is third in the world . 
kazakhstan must have an interest in reducing this level within the framework of the programme to deal with climate change . 
one possible way is the use of alternative ,  renewable energy sources ,  including wind energy ,

lahore - woodwork is a time-honoured craft that needs support to fully realise its potential ,  said pakistan national council of the arts  ( pnca )  ceo tauqeer ahmed nasir recently . 
chishtis work and style are unique . 
 ( photo by syeda zahra ) 
he said that his mother had wanted him to find a safer vocation than his older brother who was drafted into the army during the second world war . 
chisti became an apprentice to asa and nathe singh ,  two sikh masters of the craft in gurdaspur ,  india ,  and adopted a technique common among sikhs ,  but not usually practiced in the muslim community . 
visitors always greatly admired the intricate beds ,  bedsteads ,  tables ,  sofa sets ,  writing desks and cupboards produced by chishti . 
very little effort is being made to support this craft . 
this is why i want to establish a school or academy of art where i can teach the techniques that i have mastered ,  he said . 
i have also noticed that girls are becoming more interested in learning this art . 
he creates exquisite wooden objects by merging octagons ,  squares and circles in the tradition of islamic art . 
his admirers say that many images can be found in chishtis handmade pieces . 
irans chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili speaks with journalists at a news conference in tehran on <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
tehran - iran has prepared an updated nuclear package and will discuss it with the five veto-wielding permanent members of the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  security council and germany  ( known as p5+1 )  ,  irans press tv reported on september <num>1</num>  .
the package is ready to be presented ,  iranian negotiator saeed jalili said . 
we hope  [ a new ]  round of talks will be held to help the world feel progress ,  justice and peace . 
he did not say what the new package entailed . 
jalili told the state-run islamic republic news agency that his country is ready to cooperate in order to alleviate common concerns in the international arena . 
the news comes two days after france and germany warned iran that time is running out for a return to international talks on its nuclear programme lest it face the imposition of stiffer international sanctions . 
german chancellor angela merkel said she hoped to have a positive answer from iran soon ,  or else stronger measures would be considered at the p5+1 meeting in frankfurt on september <num>2</num>  .
additionally ,  western officials are dubious about irans intentions ,  noting that jalilis comments came on the eve of the p5+1 meeting in frankfurt . 
there was  " not a hint of substance "  in the reports out of tehran one official said ,  adding that it looked as if they were  " timed to split "  the unity of the security council on iran sanctions . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama has offered to engage in talks with iran but has also said that iran can expect a new round of sanctions if it does not come up with plans to answer demands that it cease all uranium enrichment activities . 
outgoing director of the international atomic energy agency mohamed el baradei ,  however ,  said that he still  " has not seen concrete evidence that tehran has an ongoing nuclear weapons programme .  "

tashkent - the largest public building in central asia ,  the uzbekistan international convention centre ,  opened its doors in uzbekistans capital on september <num>1</num>  as tashkent marked its 2200t anniversary and the country celebrated independence day . 
the new building hosted a gala concert to mark both occasions . 
white marble columns more than <num>12</num>  metres tall adorn the exterior . 
the construction of this enormous building was completed in record time ,  taking ,  from start to finish ,  only fourteen months . 
what will become of the building is difficult to predict . 
no one is certain that the structure ,  weighing tens of thousands of tonnes ,  will not cause the ground to cave in .

lahore - straw-made handicrafts are very popular in pakistan ,  especially chiks ,  which are substitutes for fabric curtains and have traditionally been used to keep out the dust as well as the blistering heat of summer afternoons . 
ramzan has been working as a craftsman of straw-made crafts since pakistan became independent <num>62</num>  years ago . 
his entire family is involved in this work . 
during winter ,  the sale of straw-made crafts is at its peak ,  when prices of straw decline . 
winter is our busiest season ,  when people visit us to purchase the maximum quantity of straw-made crafts ,  he said <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
i enjoy my work … and what we earn goes to meet our daily requirements ,  said mithu ,  another craftsman . 
prices of their crafts are not fixed . 
sometimes customers pay well ,  but at times they dont . 
the practitioners of the craft usually create custom products based on required specifications . 
most craftsmen want their children to go to school and get an education ,  so that their future can be brighter ,  but they themselves do not want to leave this art form ,  even though straw weaving yields them only moderate incomes .

they have contracted tajik companies to build it ,  creating <num>600</num>  jobs in the country . 
another <num>300</num>  jobs will be created when the complex opens . 
the head of the qatari company said the core of the complex features five <num>10</num>  to <num>16</num>  storey high-rise structures that will house up to <num>300</num>  families . 
according to committee on investment and management of state property chairman farrukh khamraliev ,  while qatar has invested more than any other arab country in tajikistan ,  in <num>2008</num>  , only two percent of total direct foreign investment in tajikistan came from arab countries .

kabul - the un office on drugs and crime  ( unodc )  afghan opium survey <num>2009</num>  noted a decrease in the cultivation and production of the drug . 
the amount of opium poppy cultivation has decreased by <num>22</num>  percent ,  opium production by ten percent and prices have fallen to a ten-year low . 
the number of provinces with no opium harvests increased from <num>18</num>  to <num>20</num>  .
due to determined anti-narcotic operations of the afghan army and nato ,  the volume of narcotics confiscated has also risen . 
unodc executive director antonio maria costa noted that these results are proof that progress to counter drug cultivation and trade is possible in afganistan . 
furthermore ,  a significant amount of afghan opium does not reach the international market due to interdiction efforts by neighbouring countries . 
the undoc estimates that afghan reserves of opium are currently more than <num>10,000</num>  tonnes ,  or double the annual global demand for opiates . 
in the first half of <num>2009</num>  , more than <num>90</num>  tonnes of chemical substances and their precursors ,  <num>450</num>  tonnes of seeds ,  <num>50</num>  tonnes of opium ,  <num>7</num>  tonnes of morphine ,  <num>1.5</num>  tonnes of heroin ,  <num>19</num>  tonnes of hashish and <num>27</num>  heroin-producing laboratories were destroyed ,  the undoc report stated . 
kazakhstan intends to become the largest global uranium producer in <num>2009</num> 
kazakhstan may become the worlds largest uranium producer as early as <num>2009</num>  , leaving world giants canada and australia behind . 
this figure will be already more than <num>12,000</num>  tonnes next year . 
according to kazatomprom ,  it is expected that canada will produce <num>11,100</num>  tonnes of uranium in <num>2009</num>  and australia will extract <num>9,430</num>  tonnes ,  while kazakhstan will produce <num>12,826</num>  tonnes of uranium . 
kazatomprom ,  the countrys only nuclear operator ,  produced <num>6,637</num>  tonnes of uranium last year compared to <num>5,281</num>  tonnes in <num>2006</num>  .
the country has not operated nuclear power plants since the government decided in april <num>1999</num>  to decommission the worlds first nuclear reactor on fast neutrons ,  bn-350 ,  at the mangyshlak atomic energy combine on the caspian sea . 
as a result ,  kazakhstan does not consume the uranium it produces but rather exports the entire output to foreign countries . 
in order to do this ,  kazatomprom needs to bring the quality of its products into line with standards adopted in the countries which consume kazakh uranium products . 
zhakishev told the news conference that his company was currently certifying uranium dioxide powder and fuel pellets for use in all types of reactors designed in the west . 
we are actively dealing now with the certification of both powder and pellets so they can be used in reactors of western design . 
the process of certification is continuing successfully now . 
i believe that the first consignments of products will be supplied to japan and the next market will be china ,  he said . 
kazakhstan has signed agreements with foreign countries on uranium supplies and setting up joint ventures to produce new value-added products . 
in june <num>2008</num>  , kazatomprom and canadas cameco set up the ulba conversion joint venture to produce <num>12,000</num>  tonnes of uranium hexafluoride a year  ( this is about <num>17</num>  percent of the worlds total conversion capacity )  . 
the project is estimated at <num>268</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  . 
cameco will provide technology to build the conversion plant .

dushanbe - on september <num>8</num>  , narcotics officers in tajikistans sogdi region disrupted a drug smuggling ring that had been operating for some time across the country and internationally to transport and sell large quantities of narcotics . 
according to narcotics control agency  ( nca )  spokesperson sadullo rakhmatulloyev ,  the drug bust came after police stopped a mercedes near the ekhson hotel in khudzhand . 
during a search of the cars interior ,  police seized three packages of heroin weighing three kilograms . 
the drugs belonged to the cars passengers ,  one a resident of khudzhand ,  and the other from the laylak district in the batken region ,  rakhmatulloyev reported . 
in the khudzhand residents home ,  two more packages of heroin weighing two kilograms were found . 
further police work led to the arrests of two other kyrgyz citizens alleged to be the remaining members of the drug-smuggling ring . 
investigation into the group's activities continues . 
bin ladens tone weakening
he does not give any warnings and is not seeking to justify the september <num>11</num>  attacks ,  said diaa rashwan ,  a leading expert on militant groups ,  who is deputy head of the al-ahram centre for political and strategic studies in cairo . 
the latest bin laden audio ,  he noted ,  was released three weeks after al-qaeda second-in-command ayman al-zawahiri spoke about the situation in pakistans swat valley . 
theodore karacic ,  head of research and development for the institute for near east and gulf military analysis  ( inegma )  ,  said bin ladens statement contains too much bluster . 
 [ he ]  is not putting any emphasis on action<abbr>...</abbr> his comment is a political statement rather than a dire warning ,  karacic said in dubai . 
saudi analyst anwar eshki ,  head of the middle east centre for strategic studies in jeddah ,  also believes the al-qaeda leaders tone has changed . 
this is the first time i have seen bin laden this weak ,  said eshki ,  who knew the al-qaeda leader when he lived in saudi arabia .

on july <num>27</num>  , spains carlos sastre won the tour de france . 
but his victory in cyclings premiere and most notable event was darkened by the shadow of illegal drugs use ,  and controversy . 
indeed only minutes after sastres victory ,  it was announced a rider from kazakhstan used a banned stimulant . 
these guys are crazy ,  and the sooner they start learning ,  the better ,  international cycling union chief pat mcquaid told aps jamey keaten in a telephone interview . 
you can never rule out at the tour de france - the biggest event of the year - that these guys are going to take risks . 
the doping bust was the fourth at this tour ,  after three other riders tested positive for a banned blood booster called epo . 
news of fofonov's failed test came while some teams were riding farewell laps on the champs-elysees . 
the stimulant is used as a vasodilator that helps relieve bronchial spasms . 
fofonov ,  known mainly as a strong climber ,  finished the tour in 19t place ,  <num>28</num>  minutes ,  <num>31</num>  seconds after sastre . 
this is the third straight year a spaniard captured the tour . 
alberto contador won last year ,  and oscar pereiro inherited the <num>2006</num>  title after it was stripped from american floyd landis due to a doping scandal . 
 " it's very moving ,  "  sastre said ,  hugging his two children .

sales of traditional eid cards decline
lahore - the muslim holy month of ramadan is almost over ,  and on september <num>20</num>  , eid ul fitr will be widely celebrated in pakistan . 
traditionally ,  eid is a time to send postcards to friends and family . 
the increasing popularity of electronic greetings ,  e-cards and text messaging ,  however ,  has sharply curtailed the sales of traditional eid cards this year . 
giving greeting cards to teachers is popular among primary and secondary students ,  particularly girls . 
younger children prefer to send cartoon eid cards to their friends . 
some have a preference for cards with photos of indian drama and film actors .

speaking before a crowd of supporters at tehran university ,  the president again questioned whether the holocaust was a  " real event "  and called it a pretext for the creation of israel . 
he said the jewish state was founded on  " a lie and a mythical claim . 
in protests around tehran and other iranian cities ,  demonstrators chanted ,   " not gaza ,  not lebanon ;  our life is for iran . 
 "  that was an expression of opposition to the government's policies of supporting palestinian militants in gaza and hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon ,  rather than addressing problems at home .

iran displays its ballistic missiles
tehran - the islamic republic of iran displayed its third generation sejjil homemade ballistic missile in a military parade on september <num>22</num>  , the local fars news agency reported . 
the second generation of advanced surface-to-surface sejjil missile was successfully launched just last <abbr>may.</abbr> 
both missiles are now being mass-produced ,  according to fars . 
iran reiterated that its military exercises and displays aim to show the islamic republics defensive power ,  and vows that its missile capabilities are strictly a defensive tool against invasions . 
the west has consistently refused to rule out the possibility of military strikes against iran over its unwillingness to halt its nuclear programme . 
were iran to produce nuclear warheads ,  its advanced missiles could transport them into the heart of europe . 
the uns international atomic energy agency has recently strongly criticised irans failure to comply with security council resolutions and refusal to abandon its uranium enrichment programme . 
iran claims its nuclear programme is for peaceful civilian purposes only .

un unanimously backs <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  nuclear disarmament goal
the security council unanimously passed the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  draft of a resolution that endorses the eventual goal of a world without nuclear weapons . 
it lays out steps for nuclear powers to trim their arsenals and make it harder for other nations to convert civilian nuclear programs to military ones . 
while it isnt clear how quickly this will come about ,  diplomats and private security experts called it the most significant un action on nuclear weapons proliferation in years . 
among his goals are new cuts in <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and russian nuclear warheads and missile launchers ;  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty ,  which bans nuclear weapons tests ;  and a major effort to secure loose nuclear materials . 
the six-page resolution mentions neither iran nor north korea ,  both the focus of major proliferation concern ,  because other nations rejected <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  attempts to include the two . 
french president nicolas sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown called for tougher sanctions on the two nations if they do not abandon their nuclear weapons programs . 
diplomats representing the five permanent members of the un security council and germany ,  the p5+1 ,  are to meet iranian officials on <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
<num>1</num>  , and sarkozy said iran had a last chance to halt uranium enrichment before an end-of-the-year deadline . 
if the talks fail ,  iran must be penalized with massive sanctions in the financial and energy sectors ,  he declared .

the iranian leader also peppered his speech with religious references ,  but most of it focused on his usual themes and featured scathing verbal attacks on archenemy israel and the west .

 ( photo by henning kaiser / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan ,  however ,  experiences severe energy shortages every winter ,  and has little choice but to develop its hydroelectric power . 
the country is unable to pay uzbekistan the amount it demands for natural gas ,  and has an accumulated debt of approximately us$19 million . 
uzbekistan ,  on the other hand ,  has not accepted water in exchange for fuel ,  reasoning that natural gas and fuel oil are commodities ,  whereas water is not . 
as a result ,  energy and the regions allocation of water resources have become intertwined issues ,  which the neighbouring states have not been able to resolve for a number of years . 
regardless of agreements reached ,  kyrgyzstan expects electricity shutdowns over an indefinite period . 
people have been advised to stock up on coal and informed that power shutdowns are supposed to be limited to the hours between midnight and dawn this winter .

tajikistan - tajikistan's sogdi region has become the centre of an intense campaign to promote energy-saving light bulbs in private homes . 
those who do not make the transition to energy-saving fluorescent bulbs will have to pay fines in accordance with a presidential decree on energy efficiency signed last april <num>24</num>  .
according to bakhadur khabibov ,  acting director of the non-profit organisation consumer union of tajikistan ,  the government has no legal basis to force consumers to adopt energy-saving bulbs ,  so the presidential decree constitutes only a recommendation that citizens adopt the technology . 
 " the consumer code clearly states that no one may be forced to buy a specific product ,  but only persuaded that the product is superior ,  "  he said .

the taliban insurgency currently has momentum in afghanistan ,  gates said ,  adding that a taliban takeover of the country would empower the al-qaeda terrorist network . 
that's long term . 
that's a strategic objective of the united states .  " 
secretary clinton added that a regional approach supporting both afghanistan and pakistan would help achieve the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  goals of defeating terrorists and protecting america and its allies around the world . 
 " we're going to come up with what we think is the best approach ,  but the goal remains the same ,  "  clinton said . 
gates added ,   " the notion of being willing to pause ,  reassess basic assumptions ,  reassess the analysis ,  and then make those decisions seems to me ,  given the importance of these decisions ,  which i've said are probably among the most important he will make in his entire presidency ,  seems entirely appropriate .

tajikistan hosts abu hanifa symposium

 ( photo by reuters / jamal saidi ) 
symposium participants included former afghan president burhoniddin rabbani ,  russian academy of sciences institute of eastern studies director vitaly naumkin ,  moscow islamic institute rector marat murtazin and russian orientalist and translator of the koran ,  valeria prokhorova . 
at the opening of the symposium ,  tajik president emomali rakhmon said that through a synthesis of religion ,  culture and philosophy ,  the hanafi creed has became recognised as one of the authoritative strains within the sunni community . 
today ,  the ideas of abu hanifa ,  given their fundamental goals ,  can form a bridge between various world cultures and become the basis for dialogue between civilisations ,  in the interests of all humankind ,  rakhmon said . 
he emphasised that abu hanifas ideas of tolerance are particularly appealing to tajiks ,  who refer to him as the great imam . 
rakhmon said that adherents of the hanafi creed have opposed violence and conflict with tolerance and dialogue for a thousand years . 
throughout history ,  resolving conflicts through violence and the clash of civilisations not only causes spiritual and moral decay ,  but destroys nations . 
tajik expert lola dodkhudoeva said that the hanafi creed has many adherents in numerous countries ,  as well as a centuries-long written tradition and history in central asia . 
many islamic ideologues in tajikistan see the hanafi creed as a counterbalance to the activity of various kinds of fundamentalist ,  modernistic and other islamic sects . 
the tajik government declared <num>2009</num>  to be the year of imam abu hanifa . 
the majority of the countrys population and its clerics adhere to sunni islam ,  particularly the hanafi creed .

health officials combat new form of tb
growing concern in baghlan province over a form of tuberculosis  ( tb )  passed from animals to humans has prompted local health officials to team with medical experts from hungary . 
in the long term ,  this project could help break the cycle of animal to human infection and visa versa . 
if successful ,  a precedent could be set for similar projects nationwide . 
while this form of tb has been almost wiped out in europe ,  medical experts such as kiss suspect that it could be common in afghanistan . 
humans could be getting infected through drinking milk that has not been pasteurised . 
this is a very simple procedure and we will provide theoretical and practical training to <num>19</num>  veterinary workers who will perform skin tests on cattle . 
the next step will be to test humans in collaboration with the central tb clinic in pul-e-khomri ,  says dr peter istvan ,  a health expert from hungary working with dr kiss . 
a man with his grandson halters a crossbreed cow on a farm near kabul ,  afghanistan  ( photo by thomas <abbr>j.</abbr> 
he said ,  the majority of tb sufferers who have contracted the disease from cattle are women and it can cause infertility and even death if it goes untreated . 
the tb pilot project has been funded by the hungarian ministry of agriculture . 
portable equipment is also being provided so that testing can take place in remote districts . 
the tb clinic will facilitate the testing and help train other health workers to do the same . 
this is a good example of how we can work together with local institutions in an effort to wipe out tb which causes devastation to thousands of people in afghanistan every year ,  said istvan . 
the cheese factory in baghlan ,  established with help from the dutch committee for afghanistan ,  has allowed the researchers to open a laboratory in their building . 
the factory employs hundreds of baghlan residents and provides a key source of revenue for the province . 
kiss and istvan are using the lab to test milk quality in order to ensure that it is disease-free and poses no risk to drink .

jamaat islami ,  hizb ut-tahrir and tablighi islami ,  organisations that have been declared extremist ,  actively preach in kyrgyzstan according to law enforcement agencies . 
under the new rules ,  groups of clerics can consist of no more than seven members . 
if they operate in a single province ,  they cannot exceed five members . 
clerics are also required to obtain licences to preach ,  after completing a <num>40</num> -day course of study . 
the governments concerns centre on the fact that some clerics advocate the creation of an islamic caliphate within kyrgyzstan ,  which would jeopardise the countrys secular system and constitutional order . 
to strengthen the publics immunity to fundamentalism ,  the government plans to introduce new courses in schools and universities by <num>2015</num>  to teach students about the activities of religious extremist groups and destructive and totalitarian organisations ,  as well as the threats posed by religious extremism and terrorism . 
tajikistan seeks energy support from turkmenistan
tajik president emomali rakhmon . 
 ( photo by petras malukas / afp / getty images ) 
observers suggest that this is because the development of bilateral relations with turkmenistan is currently of greater importance to dushanbe . 
with winter approaching ,  rakhmon wanted to gain energy support from turkmenistan ,  which it apparently achieved ,  with a bilateral agreement on energy cooperation concluded on <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
turkmenistan is currently the largest supplier of electricity in central asia . 
existing power line infrastructure enables ashgabat to export electricity to turkey ,  afghanistan ,  iran and central asian countries . 
the tajik government has said it is willing to increase supplies of aluminium roll and agro-industrial products to turkmenistan and develop cooperation in the processing of marble ,  granite and other construction materials . 
during rakhmons visit ,  two agreements were also signed by the foreign ministries to set up an intergovernmental committee on trade ,  economic ,  scientific and technological cooperation ,  and establish cooperation in sports and recreation . 
electricity supply limits introduced in tajikistan
this year ,  turkmenistan is supposed to deliver <num>1.2</num>  billion kwh of electricity to tajikistan . 
 ( photo by liu jin / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - limits on the supply of electricity to rural area residents have been introduced in tajikistan . 
this is tied to a reduction in electricity production in the country . 
currently ,  about <num>37</num>  million kwh are produced ,  while demand exceeds <num>40</num>  million kwh daily . 
electricity is supplied to residents of rural areas ,  where more than <num>70</num>  percent of the population of seven million lives ,  only from <num>5</num>  : <num>00</num>  <abbr>a.m.</abbr>  to <num>11</num>  : <num>00</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr> 
according to abdullo kurbonov ,  head of the department of energy policy of tajikistans ministry of energy and industry ,  the decrease in electricity production is tied to the decrease in water flow in the vakhsh river ,  where the countrys principle hydroelectric plants are located . 
jihad will continue ,  "  two attackers shouted before blowing themselves up ,  according to one police officer . 
most of the militants detonated suicide belts after they were injured or cornered to avoid capture ,  witnesses said . 
the four assailants were killed ,  along with a police officer and a civilian ,  sanaullah said . 
the dramatic escalation in violence appears to be an attempt by the taliban and al-qaeda to seize the initiative from the army and deliver a warning to the civilian government .

afghans uncover ancient history
local residents in the zard sang village in baghlan province have discovered monuments believed to be thousands of years old . 
the ministry of information and culture was quickly notified of the <num>25</num>  monuments ,  many of which are inscribed with drawings of animals and symbols . 
archaeologists will examine the monuments to determine their exact time period of origin and the meaning behind the inscriptions . 
the ministry is securing the area where the monuments were found to prevent looting . 
they hope that the area will eventually become a tourist attraction and generate income for the local community . 
according to the ministry of information and culture ,  there are <num>19</num>  archaeological sites in baghlan province . 
afghan artefacts continue to be found all across the country . 
last year ,  a bhuddist-era site was found by local labourers in balkh just east of the provincial capital mazar-e sharif . 
archaeologists began exploring pre-islamic artefacts in afghanistan in the <num>1950</num>  second  and continued until the soviet invasion in <num>1979</num>  .
famous historians such as louis dupree say that humans have been living in afghanistan for the past <num>50,000</num>  years and formed some of the worlds earliest farming communities . 
traders travelling between china and rome have passed through afghanistan for centuries leaving items such as plates ,  cups and jewellery behind .

iran nuclear talks outline draft resolution
<num>20</num>  , after iran said it did not want france to be part of any deal on uranium enrichment . 
at the same time ,  the official iranian news agency irna quoted  " informed sources in vienna "  who said that iran had not signed a deal . 
it said reports that iranian negotiators expressed support for a draft deal on sending uranium for processing are  " aimed at imposing psychological pressure on iran<abbr>...</abbr> but iran will not heed such pressure and will only decide on the basis of its national interests .  " 
iran has <num>1,500</num>  kilogram  of low-enriched uranium at its plant in natanz ,  in defiance of three rounds of <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  sanctions to enforce demands that it halt all enrichment activity . 
after the material is turned into metal fuel rods ,  it would then be shipped back to iran to power its small research reactor in tehran ,  according to the initial plan . 
french foreign minister bernard kouchner appeared to outline the contours of the deal ,  insisting that his country would not compromise on demanding that tehran ship out most of its enriched material .

nuclear deal with iran possible
<num>23</num>  , the deadline set for iran to sign the agreement ,  which would require it to export most of its uranium for enrichment . 
iranian diplomats and <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  russian and french delegations worked out the deal in vienna at the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  headquarters . 
under the proposed deal ,  iran would ship most of its nuclear fuel to russia ,  where it would be processed for use in a medical research reactor . 
the amount ,  approximately <num>1,200</num>  kilogram  of low-enriched uranium ,  is significant because it exceeds the <num>1,000</num>  kilogram  needed to build a bomb . 
nuclear analysts claim it would take iran only a year ,  and possibly less time ,  to replenish the amount of low-enriched uranium it would export to russia under the plan . 
some western officials ,  however ,  contend that any agreement that delays iran's ability to make a bomb marks an important step toward reining in its nuclear ambitions . 
iaea director general mohamed elbaradei ,  the host of the vienna talks ,  said he hoped an agreement would  " complete normalisation of iran's relations with the international community .  "

school children sing pakistans national anthem ,  during a rehearsal in karachi for independence day . 
patriotic pakistani music has seemingly evolved from its saccharine ,  nationalistic roots to a more thoughtful look at pakistan ,  he said . 
patriotic songs have been of paramount importance in pakistan through the decades . 
in <num>1965</num>  , a number of nationalistic songs were composed ,  which aimed to be inspirational . 
the songs reflected a love for pakistan and were also a rallying cry . 
equally unforgettable are pakistani patriotic songs that over time have found themselves incorporated in different ceremonies at schools across the country because of their chorus segments and sing-along factor . 
whether its the happy chorus of jeevay jeevay or the optimistic jazba-e-junoon ,  in <num>20</num>  years or so ,  i hope that pakistani children will still be singing the songs that have made us proud of our nation in years gone by ,  hyatt said .

kyrgyzstan - daniyar usenov has become kyrgyzstans 17t prime minister in the <num>20</num>  years since the collapse of the soviet union . 
he returned during the tulip revolution ,  and since <num>2005</num>  has served as a minister ,  mayor of the capital and director of the development fund and the presidential administration . 
he initiated a search for the former presidents family assets ,  but this populist move was unsuccessful and drew criticism from all sides . 
usenov was also involved in the scandal over ineximbank ,  which was sold to pay off its debt . 
usenov was chairman of the board and essentially the owner of the bank . 
another interesting issue is that the opposition accuses usenov of holding kazakh citizenship ,  a claim he has declined to address . 
reaction was mixed to the news of usenovs appointment . 
political analyst sanzhar tashmurzayev called him a temporary figure ,  as the president needs a loyal man during reforms . 
he is highly unpopular in political circles and irritates the electorate ,  he said . 
daniyar usenov is neither popular nor well-known ,  other than by residents of the capital who remember him as mayor of bishkek . 
usenov held one of his first meetings as prime minister with the parliamentary faction of the only opposition party . 
as for the new government ,  usenov stressed that all key ministers will retain their posts . 
he says the presidents plan to reform the state administration system will require the amendment of <num>67</num>  laws .

kyrgyz publishers unhappy with state distribution monopoly
kyrgyzstan - press distribution is a sore subject in the former soviet republics . 
local distribution enterprises ,  or sojuzpechats ,  publishing unions and the postal service ,  all soviet-era state enterprises and institutions ,  are monopolies that dictate prices . 
in some republics ,  they are used to restrict freedom of expression by refusing to distribute publications not favoured by the government . 
diidor editor-in-chief ulugbek abdusalomov says distribution is one of the most serious and sensitive problems publishers face because revenues from newsstand sales and paid subscriptions are their main source of income . 
the kyrgyzstan association of publishers and distributors believes the time has come to establish an alternative distribution network . 
it asserts that kyrgyzpochtasys monopoly hurts the development of regional publications in kyrgyzstan . 
in addition ,  the company has held back approximately us$2 million in revenue from the sale of newspapers and subscriptions which it owes to independent publishers . 
kyrgyzpochtasy doubled the cost of newspaper delivery for subscribers this year ,  forcing a number of private publications to drop their subscription services . 
the price increase affects readers in remote villages the most ,  as subscriptions to newspapers and magazines are the only way for them to keep up with current events .

georgia orders ceasefire in south ossetia
georgia says it has ordered its troops in the breakaway region of south ossetia to cease fire ,  after withdrawing its troops from tkhinvali ,  the capital of south ossetia . 
there was no response from russia to requests to end the fierce fighting in the region that began on <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>8</num>  .
russia says georgia is still firing at targets in south ossetia ,  while georgia says russia has bombed gori ,  and attacked the international airport of tbilisi . 
officials in moscow said they now control most of tkhinvali ,  as the conflict widens . 
the fighting spread to abkhazia ,  georgia's other breakaway region ,  and witnesses said russian planes bombed a military airfield outside the georgian capital . 
russian prime minister vladimir putin condemned georgia's offensive in the region ,  and also said there were signs of genocide against the ossetian people . 
officials said they have asked the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  to mediate the conflict . 
washington called russia's actions  " disproportionate "  and called for a cease-fire and a return to the status quo before the conflict began . 
russia and georgia agreed to open two humanitarian corridors to evacuate the wounded and refugees in south ossetia . 
rita khopzhayva ,  one such refugee ,  painted a bleak picture of the situation . 
the fighting began when georgia sought to regain south ossetia from separatists in a major offensive . 
russia ,  which has close ties to the province ,  responded by deploying thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks . 
leaders from around the world have called on both sides to end the fighting ,  issuing statements deploring the current situation and sending a delegation of high-level diplomats . 
the recent violence is the worst since the region won de facto independence in <num>1992</num>  .
south ossetians are eager to join their fellow ossetians in north ossetia ,  which was included within russian borders following the collapse of the soviet union in <num>1991</num>  .

the national situation remains strained ,  but people should not panic . 
the most important thing is to see a doctor quickly and not to treat yourself ,  abdikarimov said . 
the chief medical officer believes the flu pandemic spread to kyrgyzstan from russia ,  since all but one of those who have fallen ill so far are migrant workers returning from moscow or novosibirsk . 
abdikarimov said that measures to prevent an epidemic in kyrgyzstan are being stepped up . 
devices that respond to raised body temperature in passengers have been installed at all airports . 
he also advised citizens to be vaccinated against seasonal flu ,  but noted that only <num>50,000</num>  doses are currently in stock in the country . 
the world health organisation will grant kyrgyzstan ,  which has a population of more than <num>5</num>  million ,  another <num>500,000</num>  doses of h1n1 vaccine . 
the kyrgyz ministry of finance has allocated more than us$70 , 000 for the purchase of flu masks and drugs .

lahore - pink ribbon pakistan  ( prp )  ,  a group dedicated to breast cancer awareness ,  in collaboration with the institute of nuclear medicine and oncology  ( inmol )  ,  launched the first mobile mammogram clinic in pakistan . 
it will provide thousands of women the opportunity to detect breast cancer early ,  thereby increasing their chances of surviving it enormously ,  said prp national coordinator omar aftab on nov <num>3</num>  .
the mobile clinic ,  built on a lorry frame ,  is equipped with state-of-the-art mammogram and ultrasound machines . 
it can travel to remote areas of the country ,  where poor women have little or no access to medical services of any kind . 
pakistan leads central asian nations in the incidence of breast cancer . 
with the most important weapon in the fight against this disease being early detection ,  the mobile mammogram clinic will play an invaluable role in reducing the number of lives its claims . 
shaukat khanam cancer hospital lahore ,  the leading cancer treatment centre in pakistan ,  reported that about <num>25</num>  percent of the oncology or tumour cases reported there over the last five years were breast cancers . 
unfortunately ,  most women in pakistan have been reluctant to consult doctors about the disease ,  out of concern for modesty ,  or as in most cases ,  because they are simply unable to afford a visit to a clinic ,  let alone the us$30 to <num>100</num>  $  cost of a mammography . 
consequently ,  almost <num>44</num>  percent of all breast cancer cases to date in pakistan have been detected only at advanced stages . 
mammography is the best way to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage and our mobile clinic will save the lives of countless numbers of women in pakistan ,  aftab concluded .

to the north ,  a mortar shell fired against a pakistani base in the khyber border area of landi kotal missed its target but struck a passenger bus ,  killing six civilians and wounding <num>16</num>  , government official fazal mahmoud said . 
taliban militants have carried out ,  or been suspected of ,  hundreds of bloody bombings in pakistan against western ,  military and government targets in recent years ,  including a surge in violence over the last seven weeks that has killed more than <num>300</num>  people ,  mostly civilians .

the peoples war against tehrik-e-taliban
it is time to develop a peaceful life and break away from fear of the ttp ,  he said . 
they should be dealt with using an iron hand . 
khan ,  a resident of kanigurram ,  a former ttp hub ,  accused the group of butchering people ,  and called it an enemy of islam and humanity . 
no religion ,  including islam ,  allows the killing of humans…our hearts bleed for the hundreds of innocent victims and our security officials who have been killed by the taliban ,  he said . 
she went further ,  contending that a criminal is a criminal ,  but the ptt are doubly criminal ,  because they have the gall to say they are doing all this in the name of islam . 
in no way does islam allow the killing of innocents or  [ support ]  what the taliban is doing . 
they are defaming islam ,  she said . 
all pakistanis should unite against these terrorists . 
policy makers must recognise that the current conflict is not one war but three wars of action ,  networks and ideas ,  said dr ali qazilbash ,  the head of law at lahores university of management sciences . 
viewing violent extremism from this perspective will facilitate the integration of policy and strategy to combat it effectively ,  he contended . 
one year after mumbai attacks ,  seven suspects charged in pakistan
islamabad - ceremonies were held in mumbai to mark the first anniversary of a series of devastating attacks on the indian city by militants . 
a police parade ,  the inauguration of a memorial and a candle-lit prayer service were among the events . 
the three days of attacks ,  which began a year ago ,  left <num>174</num>  people dead ,  including nine gunmen . 
the only surviving attacker ,  pakistani muhammed ajmal qasab ,  is currently facing trial in india . 
the mumbai gunmen staged coordinated attacks on a number of sites ,  including the railway station ,  two luxury hotels and the nariman house jewish community centre . 
dozens of people painted slogans on a wall in southern mumbai ,  where the attacks were concentrated . 
the attacks led india to suspend peace talks with pakistan . 
in july ,  indian prime minister manmohan singh said talks would not restart until the mumbai attacks suspects were brought to justice .

pakistan is committed to rooting out terrorism
the search was conducted under the directives of ministry of interior to stop acts of violent extremists in the wake of operation rah-e-nijat in south waziristan ,  the spokesman said . 
police have been directed to increase patrolling and special anti-terrorist squads have been deployed to ensure security around public buildings and government installations . 
a ministry statement asserted that militants are trying to expand their campaign of violent extremism in other areas of the country to distract the militarys offensive in south waziristan . 
violent extremism is a menace that is symbolic of a particular mind set . 
it has many facets ,  and the government is fighting a war for peace in the country ,  he said . 
pakistans security agencies are performing well at the borders and throughout the country to eliminate extremism and terrorism from the society . 
iran plans enrichment sites in defiance of un

joint policy on afghanistan will benefit central asian nations
more than six million people ,  <num>40</num>  percent of them female ,  attend school in afghanistan . 
each country in the region is working to develop its own government and economy ,  he said ,  but without a stable and peaceful afghanistan ,  these efforts will be in vain ,  as the situation there has a negative impact on every central asian country . 
sharipov added that conditions need to be created to encourage the afghan government to implement constructive domestic social policies . 
he argues that this will contribute to the development of education and the arts ,  which he believes will generate stability there and throughout the region . 
such policies ,  however ,  cannot be implemented in provinces not under governmental control . 
tajik ambassador to afghanistan saiid mukhammed khairokh said that over the past eight years ,  afghanistan has made great progress in developing its economy ,  which could not be said of the period when the taliban ran the country . 
he said the government had developed education ,  healthcare and transport . 
today ,  more than six million people ,  <num>40</num>  percent of them female ,  attend schools in afghanistan . 
the countrys foreign policy priorities include a joint effort with pakistan to fight the taliban ,  and economic cooperation with central asian countries . 
tajik political analyst rashid gani abdullo noted ,  however ,  that the current situation in afghanistan is complicated by instability in rural regions controlled by the taliban . 
he contends that progress will be made quickly in stable provinces . 
that has allowed them to become transit corridors for goods exported to and imported from southern and central asia ,  which could serve as a model appealing to moderate forces in areas under taliban control and generate change . 
he also noted the need for all central asian countries to devise a common policy on aid to afghanistan ,  a region which poses the joint threats of extremist groups and trade in illegal drugs ,  which have negative effects throughout the region . 
government will not hold talks with taliban
the government has decided not to hold talks with terrorists and  [ military ]  operations will continue against them ,  malik said . 
pakistans leadership has already stated that the government will show extremists who are targeting both civilians and security personnel no leniency . 
militants captured by security forces have revealed that the residences of the president and prime minister in islamabad are on their hit list ,  malik said . 
security has been tightened in islamabad and other cities to counter the terrorist threat against major government offices and installations . 
after facing defeat in swat ,  malakand and south waziristan ,  the taliban are sending messages requesting talks with the government and a suspension of the military operation ,  but it is too late now ,  malik said . 
long before the current offensive began ,  the government asked taliban fighters to give up their weapons and become peaceful citizens ,  but they did not take the offer seriously ,  malik added . 
according to him ,  south waziristan will be secure in a few days ,  as the military has taken control of major neighbourhoods . 
a search of the remaining villages ,  mountains and forests will soon be conducted to eliminate terrorists there . 
islamabad police thwart bomb-makers ,  suicide bombers
islamabad - the tehrik-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  leadership instructed operatives in islamabad to prepare <num>25</num>  autos and motorcycles for suicide bombing attacks on security forces and civilians in south waziristan ,  police said <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
violent extremist attacks and sabotage activities in the tribal areas are more severe ;  causing greater bloodshed and damage than in urban areas . 
nfwp minister for communication mian iftikhar said security forces are doing all they can to stop the attacks . 
we are taking safety measures for citizens . 
police have captured explosive-laden vehicles and arrested suspected suicide bombers ,  which is a triumph against terrorists . 
reports of rising extremism in punjab have frightened residents in lahore . 
but punjab minister for law and parliamentary affairs rana sanaullah said the terrorist network there has been broken . 
the government firmly believes that the terrorist network has been shattered in the province . 
terrorists attack public places to create panic and instability ,  he said . 
to dissuade future attempts ,  his office is beefing up security at government installations and business districts . 
tajikistan creates independent national electric grid
prior to the launch of the south-north power line ,  up to <num>85</num>  percent of electricity in tajikistans sughd province came from uzbekistan . 
 ( photo by reuters / hazir reka ) 
president of tajikistan emomali rakhmon attended the ceremony inaugurating the power line and said tajikistan now had its own united national grid and had taken another step towards energy independence . 
the export-import bank of china provided us$267 million of the <num>281</num>  $  million needed to build the power line ,  as a long-term loan ,  and chinese firm tbea built it in three years . 
tajik authorities predict the cost of the power line that will carry up to <num>8.6</num>  billion kwh of electricity per year will be recouped within seven years . 
before it became operational ,  <num>85</num>  percent of electricity in tajikistans sughd province came from uzbekistan ,  while the local kairakkum hydroelectric power station supplied just <num>15</num>  to <num>20</num>  percent of the provinces electricity . 
uzbekistans withdrawal from the united central asian energy system offers further evidence that this project was useful and timely ,  a press release by tajikistans state electric company barki tochik asserted . 
it added that the sughd province grid can now be fed from the tajik national grid . 
with the help of this energy facility ,  new high-voltage power lines that will link tajikistans national grid with those of kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan will be built in future . 
the capacity of the new power line is double the energy requirements of sughd province . 
tajik president calls on nation to contribute to complete rogun
tajikistans president emomali rakhmon hopes that his call to citzens to purchase rogun hydroelectric power plant stock will be supported by the populace . 
 ( photo by petra malukas / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - tajikistans president emomali rakhmon called on every family to invest in the construction of the rogun hydroelectric power plant to secure the countrys energy independence . 
with the average monthly per capita income at us$70 a month ,  he suggested they purchase $us700 in the hydroelectric plants stock . 
rakhmons rationale for this initiative is that us$600 million is needed to launch the first phase of the rogun hydroelectric power plant and the government does not have it . 
according to minister of finance safarali nadjmuddinov ,  rogun hydroelectric power plant stock will be issued by the beginning of <num>2010</num>  .
the presidents press office noted that rogun stock would be sold only to tajik citizens ,  as the rogun hydroelectric power plant belongs to tajiks and the tajik state . 
some experts were critical of the presidents demand as more than half of tajikistans population subsists under the poverty line . 
for the overwhelming majority of the population ,  an investment of <num>700</num>  $  to purchase rogun stock is simply impossible . 
against that dismal background ,  a rogun boom is being observed in the country . 
businesses ,  organisations and state institutions have been pressured to fulfill the presidents call for funds by transferring cash to the current account of the hydroelectric plant . 
for example ,  <num>5800</num>  public sector employees of the asht district in sogdiisk region kicked in almost <num>10,000</num>  $  , or one days wages ,  and kulyab city government employees transferred one days earnings in the amount of more than <num>5000</num>  $  .
the management of the nations largest company ,  tajik aluminum ,  also contributed to  " the construction project of the century "  by investing more than one month of their salaries in rogun . 
almost <num>40</num>  million kwh of electricity are produced in tajikistan every day ,  but that is not enough to meet demand . 
and with the december <num>1</num>  withdrawal of uzbekistan from central asian united energy system ,  it is now technically impossible to transmit power to turkmenistan from any external source . 
rogun is the only answer ,  and citizens will have to dig deep into their pockets or live with power blackouts year round . 
kazakh cousins convicted of violent extremism
 ( svoboda radio ) 
suleimenov and zhobolayev ,  along with a group of other young astana residents ,  were arrested by russias federal security service  ( fsb )  in ingushetia ,  an autonomous russian region in the caucasus . 
according to the detainees ,  they were there to undergo medical treatment through the koran ,  which is becoming more and more popular among muslim believers . 
the fsb charged the kazakhs with attempting to join the radical extremist underground . 
the detainees were sent by prisoner transport from russia back to kazakhstan ,  where only the cousins were charged . 
suleimenov is seriously disabled and confined to a wheelchair . 
in the end ,  the courts handling of the case left a number of questions unanswered . 
many consider the fight against violent extremism a holy cause ,  and kazakhstan as a country governed by the rule of law ,  with each person equal under the law . 
but the rationale of  " you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs "  is a rather weak one to justify punishing the innocent in the name of countering terrorism .

kazakhstan develops swine flu vaccine
if kazakh vaccines prove viable ,  their price on the domestic market will be <num>40</num>  to <num>50</num>  percent lower than foreign vaccines . 
 ( photo by str / afp / getty images ) 
kazakhstan now has its own technologies and vaccines ,  and will therefore be able to deal with the threat of swine and bird flu in time to protect the public ,  tuymebayev stated . 
if tests of the kazakh vaccines prove that they are viable ,  their prices on the domestic market will be <num>40</num>  to <num>50</num>  percent lower than those of foreign drugs . 
kazakhstan also plans to export its vaccines . 
the director of the who national flu centre laboratory ,  oleg kiselev ,  said that testing the vaccines would take six weeks . 
all pre-clinical trials were carried out in kazakhstan ,  at a cost of us$2 . 9 million ,  said the research centres director for bio-security issues ,  professor seidigapbar mamadaliyev . 
speaking on television at the beginning of december ,  kazakh deputy health minister tamara voshchenkova once again denied rumours that authorities were concealing the true extent of the swine flu epidemic in kazakhstan . 
these rumours arose due to the deaths over the past few weeks of <num>11</num>  people supposedly diagnosed with pneumonia . 
according to her ,  seasonal flu is the biggest problem currently facing kazakhstan . 
she added ,  however ,  that catching acute respiratory infections or the seasonal flu might help people acquire immunity against the h1n1 virus . 
volunteerism struggles to develop foothold in kazakhstan
almaty - although <num>20</num>  volunteer groups are registered in kazakhstan ,  only five are actually operating ,  participants at an international conference on volunteerism were recently told . 
that low level of activity ,  and a desire to make the functioning groups more effective ,  brought together activists and media december <num>8</num>  for a conference on the development of volunteer activity :  the international experience . 
most organizations simply talk about the need for volunteer principles ,  but carry out few projects . 
kassenov said the number of social service projects involving volunteers is limited ,  and most volunteer work is focused on the environment and education . 
volunteer groups in the country have no incentives ,  especially in terms of press coverage ,  kassenov said . 
many media organizations see efforts by volunteers not as a desire to help society ,  but as a for-profit special interest ,  which is often far from the reality . 
kassenov said many media are biased against volunteer initiatives because the media focus on pre-determined topics . 
many in kazakhstan still think in terms of free capitalism and capital accumulation . 
elena norakidze ,  a peace corps program director ,  noted that ,  by comparison ,  american volunteers are self-motivated people willing to help others . 
peace corps volunteers usually have university degrees and want to contribute their skills and knowledge to social ,  economic ,  and humanitarian projects without expecting anything in return . 
according to her ,  <num>113</num>  peace corps volunteers are working in <num>11</num>  of kazakhstans <num>14</num>  regions on education ,  promotion of governmental and non-governmental organizations and youth development . 
bayan usenova ,  head of the usenova international charitable foundation ,  said volunteers face various problems . 
she noted that the level of confidence and understanding toward volunteerism has decreased in society and people are unable to understand the sincere and free commitment of selfless people . 
she added that a volunteer works to satisfy his or her spiritual needs . 
volunteer movements in kazakhstan are underdeveloped because there has been no demand ,  said saule alpyssova ,  deputy director of the information resource centre . 
she noted that the lack of a law governing volunteer groups was one of the major problems . 
alpyssova said that volunteers can be drawn in through mass appeal campaigns that attract public attention to social issues . 
the information resource centre maintains a database of volunteers which works with youth organizations and conducts awareness campaigns . 
the meeting participants came to the unanimous conclusion incentives to attract volunteers are needed ,  and that volunteers must be self-motivated and not forced to participate in projects . 
participants agreed on the need for a coordinating centre and said more media coverage would help volunteers work more effectively . 
part of the reason for the nascent development of volunteerism is volunteer work has not been encouraged by the educational system or by the kazakh ministry of labour and social security . 
this picture is characteristic of all countries in central asia ,  said experts at the conference . 
many religions face uphill battle in central asia
muslims in uzbekistan attend a prayer service . 
religious restrictions in most central asian countries ,  including uzbekistan ,  rate very high . 
 [ getty images ] 
central asian nations rank among some of the most religiously restrictive countries in the world ,  according to a study by the pew forum on religion  & amp ;  public life released december <num>16</num>  .
religious restrictions are common in every part of the world ,  said brian grim ,  a senior researcher for the pew forum and primary investigator on the study . 
central asia stands out . 
that area tends to have restrictions almost on-par with the middle east or north africa . 
according to grims research ,  the middle east and north africa are the most restrictive regions in the world for religions ,  while north and south america are least restrictive . 
the study was conducted by surveying national constitutions ,  and collecting reports by governmental and non-governmental organizations  ( ngos )  on refugees and religious freedoms . 
the report reviewed <num>192</num>  nations and six self-governing territories . 
to measure governmental restrictions ,  pew researchers identified <num>20</num>  criteria for their survey ,  including constitution religious freedom clauses ,  government censorship of religious materials and symbols ,  and violence or intimidation toward religious groups . 
to measure social hostilities toward religion ,  researchers looked at <num>13</num>  issues ranging from incidents of mob violence targeting religions ,  religious-based terror activities in the nation ,  and acts of religious extremism ,  such as honour killings . 
pakistan was ranked most restrictive among central asian nations with an average of <num>7.54</num>  .
it ranked <num>8.4</num>  on the social hostilities index . 
turkmenistan and tajikistan were considered least restrictive among central asian nations ,  but still averaged <num>3.6</num>  each ,  which is still considered highly restrictive on the index . 
both had low scores for social hostilities ,  but high scores for governmental restrictions . 
grim said much of the reason for religious restriction in central asia stems from ongoing fallout from the dissolution of the soviet union . 
grim said several nations in central asia have become religiously restrictive as the government strives to create a national identity . 
in doing so ,  those governments feel they must sometimes temper the rights of those they perceive to be threats to the government or national security . 
uzbekistan ,  for instance ,  ranks third on the pew report for most governmental restrictions on religion in the world . 
the report notes that ,  as a former soviet republic ,  there is an inherent distrust of religion as a whole as a threat to the government . 
government restrictions on religion in uzbekistan ,  in part ,  stem from the attempt to restrict the activities of religious groups perceived to be a security threat such as islamist groups ,  and in part the attempt to control the growth of some newer religious groups that uzbeks join that are considered non-traditional ,  such as evangelical christian groups ,  grim said . 
in other cases ,  however ,  grim says the restrictions come not from the government ,  but from society itself . 
according to the pew report ,  three central asian countries ranked higher on the social hostilities index than on governmental restriction . 
often ,  in those cases ,  grim said those nations have vocal minority religious groups that are striving to have their voice heard . 
kyrgyzstan ,  for instance ,  ranked <num>5.5</num>  on the social hostilities index ,  in part because of tension in the ferghana valley between muslims and other religious groups . 
akhmedova pointed out that religious groups in uzbekistan also face social hostilities - uzbekistan was given a <num>3.1</num>  rating for social hostilities on the pew index ,  which would be considered moderate - specifically those who are not muslim . 
police roundups in the gathering places of jehovahs witnesses ,  seventh day adventists ,  and the society of krishna consciousness have become routine ,  akhmedova said . 
they are called traitors . 
they are considered to have betrayed islam for having changed their views . 
akhemedova said police often take christians into custody for identification ,  where they are insulted ,  humiliated and later released and added that the nation is <num>88</num>  percent muslim . 
grim said that could be cause for concern for an increase in governmental restrictions in the future . 
the study showed a statistical link between government restrictions and social hostilities ,  he said . 
restrictions foster animosity from religious minorities ,  animosity from religious minorities cause more government restrictions . 
grim said that was the main reason for why both afghanistan and pakistan ranked so high on the list . 
in both cases ,  religious extremists have created a tense and often violent atmosphere ,  especially for those of other religious views . 
that power has created a fear by both governments that religious extremists could gain more power and topple the existing leadership ,  leading them to crackdown on religious freedoms . 
khan said pakistani law dictates that minorities can not run for president of pakistan . 
under precedent a minority also can not be a religious minister ,  though a muslim can be a minister for minority affairs . 
grim said the pew forum expects to update the report annually to monitor religious freedom worldwide . 
rashid musaev in tashkent and hasan khan in islamabad contributed to this report . 
tajikistans children still forced to harvest cotton
tajik villagers collect cotton in the village of yangiabad ,  about <num>140</num>  km outside dushanbe ,  in this <num>2006</num>  file photo . 
despite laws to the contrary ,  children are still forced to participate in the cotton harvest . 
according to project co-ordinator gulchekhra rakhmanova ,  the project conducted monitoring at all of the countrys large cotton fields ,  particularly in the sogdii oblast ,  khatlon oblast and the region of republican subordination . 
the use of child labour in cotton fields began during the time of the soviet union . 
in tajikistan ,  cotton profits make up about <num>11</num>  percent of gdp . 
children ages <num>12</num>  to <num>18</num>  work in the fields . 
but ,  according to some teachers ,  <num>8</num> -year-old children were also forced to work . 
the field work season is from september to december . 
children work under unfavourable conditions ,  including hot weather ,  poor quality food and water and a lack of necessary medicines . 
in january <num>2006</num>  , president emomali rakhmon issued a decree banning the use of students in work that harms the educational process throughout the school year . 
however ,  the decree has not been fully implemented . 
hazardous and exploitative child labour also violates the un convention on the rights of the child . 
the tajikistan government ratified the convention in <num>1993</num>  , obligating the country to comply with it under international law . 
they pick cotton in the cold ,  the children are not fed ,  they drink water from a ditch and ,  of course ,  their labour is unpaid . 
but they were required to go out to the fields as the school teachers threatened to throw them out of school ,  makhina said . 
nargis shokhmansurova ,  director of the nongovernmental organisation shifo ,  said the same situation was observed in the shaartuz region . 
children are not torn from the education process ,  but they are forced to go to the cotton fields on the weekends ,  she said . 
two 7th-grade students in shaartuz regions secondary school №1 ,  who asked to remain anonymous ,  said that from october to november the form master made them pick cotton . 
the situation is similar in northern tajikistan . 
eleventh-grade students at school №41 in bobojon gafurovskii region ,  sogdii oblast ,  said that during october and november they picked cotton after school . 
headmaster maruf tukhtayev said that students are not made to work :  generally ,  students who wanted to help went to the fields to help the farmers . 
nozira muminova ,  a resident of the ovcha kalacha zhamoat whose three children attend the school ,  said that two of her children were forced to pick cotton . 
i forbade my son to pick cotton . 
after that ,  he was expelled from school . 
he did not go there for a week ,  the woman said . 
i am categorically against my son picking cotton . 
he is small and hard work could adversely affect his health . 
i send my kid to school ,  where he should study ,  not work in the fields ,  where he is neither fed nor paid ,  nozira said . 
according to gulchekhra rakhmanova ,  on january <num>19</num>  , the government of tajikistan will furnish the un committee on the rights of the child a periodic national report on its implementation of the convention of the rights of the child . 
they will have to answer the uns questions ,  one of which will be devoted to this issue . 
we are hoping that the governmental delegation will be able to answer all of the questions raised by the member of the un committee on the rights of the child ,  said the human rights activist . 
investment conference creates awareness for tapping potential
people look at booths displaying information about investment opportunities in the gilgit-baltistan region of pakistan during a week-long presentation in lahore . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore -- nasir abbas ,  senior production supervisor ,  rupani foundation ,  gilgit ,  was enthusiastic during the gilgit-baltistan  ( gb )  investment week january <num>4</num> -<num>8</num>  at the lahore chamber of commerce and industry  ( lcci )  . 
there ,  he met investors ,  and learned about local market needs and increasing market exposure - a core issue in the gems business . 
mian shafqat ali ,  advisor on investment to gbs governor ,  told central asia online why so little consideration had been given in the past to that part of the country . 
disinformation about the northern areas of pakistan being under the siege of terrorism made investors reluctant in the past . 
also ,  investors were hesitant that natives of gb ,  due to their conservative nature ,  might avoid embracing foreign investment ,  but after the gb elections the situation is quite encouraging today ,  he said . 
the business community understands that the ongoing phase of militancy will be over very soon ,  that gb is a peaceful area where crime rate is low and prospects are massive . 
he said there is no need for foreign investment for the next two to three years since ample domestic investment in desired sectors is available . 
later ,  foreign opportunities will open ,  he said . 
lcci members stressed that the private sector could play a role in taking advantage of investment prospects for things like power generation ,  cement ,  tourism ,  communication ,  minerals and mines and food industry ,  particularly preservation of fruits . 
rahat kareem ,  tourism promotion officer ,  tourism department northern areas ,  gilgit said he got a lot out of the conference . 
billions of dollars could be earned by highlighting only the tourism potential of this area but unfortunately never ever in the past a due attention was given toward this sector ,  he said . 
organic farming has a huge potential because of availability of hard-working human resources ,  shafqat said . 
the availability of trained farmers ,  well-established tissue culture laboratories ,  storage and certification services create opportunities for investment . 
baber yaqoob fateh mohammad ,  gb chief secretary ,  gave a presentation focusing on renewable energy ,  food processing and gems and jewellery . 
he also assured businessmen of the availability of soft loans for establishing modern horticulture business enterprises while expansion of karakoram highway and opening of babusar-naraan road ,  expansion of new air links are added advantages . 
central asians discuss energy reforms urged by world bank
workers service an oil well in kyzylorda ,  kazakhstan . 
the world bank says central asian countries risk becoming energy importers and accelerating climate change . 
 [ oleg nikishin / getty images ] 
the banks report ,  lights out ,  was released in march and predicts countries in eastern europe and central asia  ( eca )  might have to spend us <num>3.3</num>  $  trillion over the next <num>20</num>  years to modernize their energy-extraction and electric-generation infrastructures . 
otherwise ,  the bank said ,  the countries risk becoming energy importers and accelerating climate change . 
the central asian states ,  though ,  have a long history of distrust that impedes efforts to co-operate on electricity ,  the bank said . 
the region has both exporters and importers of hydrocarbons . 
kazakhstan ,  turkmenistan and uzbekistan are in the first group . 
the importers include water-rich tajikistan and kyrgyzstan . 
as soviet republics ,  the first group delivered fossil fuels to the second in the winter in exchange for irrigation water in the summer . 
but such regional co-operation has been lacking in the post-soviet era ,  said peter thomson ,  the world banks director for sustainable development in europe and central asia . 
all the central asian countries have underinvested in infrastructure modernisation ,  he said . 
furthermore ,  though they must collaborate for ideal long-term results ,  they dont always . 
such lack of co-operation leads to suboptimal energy results ,  thomson said . 
the bank has responded by lending individually to each country while giving a regional focus to its technical support and analysis . 
the only country among the five in which it is not engaged is turkmenistan ,  he said . 
officials and analysts from the countries acknowledge the magnitude of the energy challenge . 
in kazakhstan ,  with the greatest resources of the three central asian energy exporters ,  industry insiders disagree on whether to build new oil refineries or renovate existing ones . 
the government plans to invest us <num>4</num>  $  billion to modernise its three oil refineries ,  deputy oil and gas minister aset magauov said during the kazrefinex-2010 symposium . 
raushan sarmuzrina ,  from the same ministry ,  said kazakhstan lacks the oil to justify building new refineries . 
the bank has urged eca countries to upgrade their power grids ,  to take on the unpopular task of raising electricity rates to reflect production costs -- and to collect the money electricity consumers owe . 
state-owned uzbekenergo press-service said it is installing an automated system to measure power consumption nationwide . 
uzbekenergo claims the planned tajik rogun power station could disrupt regional environmental conditions ,  depriving the region of drinking and irrigation water . 
but the tajiks consider rogun essential to solving their countrys energy shortages . 
tajikistan has the worlds highest reliance on hydroelectric power ,  relying on water power for <num>95</num>  %  of its energy ,  said independent energy analyst georgii petrov of dushanbe . 
petrov praised kazakhstan for raising power rates  " nearly tenfold "  in the early <num>1990</num>  second  ,  a move that he said has spared it from the power shortages tajikistan now faces . 
kyrgyzstan ,  though ,  will not be able to stop using obsolete ,   " dirty "  power stations anytime soon ,  said azamat omorov ,  chief renewable-energy specialist for the kyrgyz energy ministry . 
analysts and officials overall acknowledge the urgency of the energy problem . 
but over the next <num>20</num>  years ,  intentions will collide with economic cycles ,  national rivalries ,  corruption ,  and political unrest -- factors that have endangered reforms countless times before . 
central asian border guards learn from each other at osce workshop
tajik border guards discuss a border-management problem at an osce workshop . 
 [ jamila sujud ] 
dushanbe -- by learning from each other ,  border guards from neighbouring countries can avoid conflicts . 
thats the viewpoint attendees of the osce border management staff college  ( bmsc )  have adopted . 
the workshop for border guards from the frequently feuding central asian states runs april <num>26</num> -<num>30</num>  in dushanbe . 
the workshop resonates in a region where border conflicts reign and governments have yet to delineate their shared borders . 
kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan experience the most disputes . 
its important for border officers to meet each other and develop common approaches to the implementation of border management ,  bmsc senior lecturer sergei batyuk said . 
when the border guards of two countries know each other ,  it is always easier to address issues that come up . 
seminar participants seek to improve regional co-operation among their border forces by learning from osce member-states experiences . 
ten tajik border-checkpoint chiefs and two representatives from kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan are participating in the seminar . 
alisher rakhimov ,  chief of tajikistans panji poyon border checkpoint ,  said the seminar provided in-depth knowledge of the field of state-border security ,  particularly at border checkpoints . 
holding such seminars is useful because the border guards can learn not only about their countries institutions but also about their neighbours ,  said ulugbek kadiyev ,  chief of kyrgyzstans dostuk roadway border checkpoint . 
central asias border guards all have similar problems ,  he said . 
at the seminar ,  they discussed them with the advantage that the seminar incorporated the experience accrued by all <num>56</num>  osce member-states ,  batyuk said . 
bmsc ,  the <num>2009</num>  creation of which the osce office in dushanbe oversaw ,  is the osces largest project carried out in the field of border management ,  bmsc director wolfgang maierhofer said . 
the organisation plans more seminars for central asias border guards . 
it also envisions programmes designed especially for afghan trainees . 
our college will be a model for the application of the best practical skills and will provide a platform for sharing knowledge and providing access to the latest thinking ,  methodologies ,  techniques and technologies ,  he said .

 [ talgat karbetov ] 
kazakhstani and turkish presidents nursultan nazarbayev and abdullah gul attended the opening ceremony . 
the arms fair ,  being staged at an air force base ,  is open to the public . 
workers set up more than <num>150</num>  display stands ;  about <num>100</num>  of them exhibit kazakhstani military goods . 
more than <num>200</num>  firms from around the world are displaying logistical equipment ,  uniforms ,  munitions ,  tanks ,  armored personnel carriers and other military technology . 
russian companies accounted for the majority of exhibited goods . 
to entertain the public ,  kazakhstani generals arranged an air show by elite air force units and paratroopers . 
excited spectators applauded loop-the-loops by pilots in mig-29s and su-27s . 
paratroopers landed and conducted a mock storming of a hypothetical enemys headquarters . 
the accompanying artillery barrage was so powerful that spectators could smell the gunpowder ,  courtesy of the stiff steppe wind . 
kazakhstani defence factories are quite good and have great potential to sell their production abroad ,  said sen mukhtar altynbayev ,  a defence minister for many years . 
during world war ii ,  <num>90</num>  %  of the red armys bullets came from kazakhstan ,  he said . 
we don't produce so many munitions now . 
but we have to change the situation . 
the opportunities are vast . 
of course ,  we won't be the leading players in this market ,  but we can play a certain role at the regional level "  . 
israel's elbit systems hopes to interest kazakhstani buyers with a sampling of its hardware ,  such as drones ,  said elbit vice-president for regional marketing michael levin . 
 " i think this technology will be suitable for kazakhstan "  ,  levin said . 
temir isakhanov ,  an engineer with an interest in military technology ,  went to the exhibition with his two sons . 
 " my boys are really interested in military technology ,  and i couldn't take my eyes off  ( the hardware )  either . 
this is a great opportunity for experts and ordinary visitors alike "  . 
sophia loren visits almaty at jewellers invitation
almaty ,  kazakhstan - on march <num>2</num>  , italian and international film star sophia loren ,  <num>75</num>  , visited almaty . 
she was invited by damiani ,  the jeweller ,  to promote a new line of jewellery that she immediately put on . 
loren spent six hours in the city ,  in the recently opened rixos luxury hotel . 
one of the events attendees said the italian actress was the centre of attention for the whole evening ,  receiving flowers ,  compliments and requests for autographs and photos . 
at her age ,  you can have problems simply walking ,  but she is an utterly chic woman ,  one of the guests told central asia online . 
world-famous stars are no rarity to almaty . 
a month earlier ,  singer-actress jennifer lopez came to the same hotel for the birthday of the younger daughter of president nursultan nazarbayev . 
other international celebrities who have visited almaty in recent years include the black eyed peas ,  whitney houston ,  elton john ,  arash ,  anastacia ,  james blunt and nelly furtado . 
a frequent guest of kazakhstan is gerard depardieu ,  who recently starred in late love ,  which takes place in the south kazakh oblast . 
the stars come at the behest of kazakhstani elites and companies . 
nobody discloses the payments for the appearances ,  but organisers speak of six-figure sums . 
it makes me happy to see kazakhstan become known on the world map ,  said club photographer adil sadykov . 
such interesting people visit us ,  and i think that we will gradually develop world-famous stars of our own . 
pop icon redefines meaning of jihad
pakistani pop music star salman ahmad  ( centre )  sings with balinese children at the ninth international congress on aids in asia and the pacific in nusa dua ,  bali ,  august <num>10</num>  .
salman recently published a memoir ,  rock  & amp ;  roll jihad :  a muslim rock stars revolution . 
karachi ,  pakistan -- pakistans most popular singer ,  salman ahmad ,  is on a mission . 
the <num>46</num> -year-old singer is striving to rescue what he considers the true concept of jihad . 
he said imposters and terrorists have stolen it ,  terming it a sinister case of identity theft . 
according to him ,  al-qaeda and osama bin laden have hijacked holy terminology to redefine muslims and justify senseless violence . 
in his view ,  the war under jihad is a defensive battle ,  rather than an offensive concept . 
the world largely misunderstands jihads true nature ,  he said . 
the book tells the story of his passion for making music and of rocks power to unite . 
grammy-winning american singer melissa etheridge wrote the foreword . 
salman told central asia online ,  i have written the book to clear the misconceptions and confusions prevailing in the minds of youth . 
facing religious zealots and a military regime in the <num>80</num>  second  that wanted all music banned ,  salman and his band junoon  ( passion )  rocketed to the top of the music charts . 
against this backdrop ,  salman waged his underground jihad to bring rock music to audiences in pakistan . 
with modest beginnings ,  he started a guitar club that played for private lahore parties ,  mixing urdu love poems with casio synthesisers ,  tabla drums with fender stratocasters ,  and ragas with power chords . 
eventually he joined his first pop band ,  vital signs . 
later ,  he founded junoon . 
his creative vigour did not go unnoticed by his enemies . 
as was true for the rest of society ,  the <num>1980</num>  second  were trying times for music under the military regime of conservative islamist general zia-ul-haq . 
while rival politicians suffered public floggings and execution ,  censors barred musicians for the flimsiest of reasons . 
in <num>1997</num>  , then-prime minister nawaz sharif of the pakistan muslim league lambasted salmans former band ,  vital signs ,  saying :  looking at those singing dil dil pakistan ,  i feel like calling in a barber and having their long hair shaved off ,  effectively creating an embargo of the group and others like them . 
but salman was not only persecuted by the islamists . 
he and his band junoon suffered political censorship during the rule of largely liberal benazir bhutto ,  partly due to a song denouncing political corruption . 
salmans jihad continues ,  but now he has taken on the taliban . 
he criticised the governments <num>2009</num>  peace deal with the taliban of swat in a washington post op-ed piece . 
president asif ali zardaris ill-conceived appeasement will only embolden the taliban and may squelch more of pakistans voices of peace just when pakistanis and the world need to hear them most ,  he warned . 
but the talibanisation of society and the prevailing extremism have already bruised society . 
challenging the often rigidly held concept of music being taboo in islam ,  salman said a minority of extremists declared music forbidden . 
a very small body of the political and religious elite created confusion for selfish means ,  he said . 
religious scholar khalid zaheer ,  dean of the faculty of arts and social sciences at the university of central punjab ,  shares salmans viewpoint . 
khalid says melodious tones ,  sound ,  good poetry and recital are meant to be enjoyed and islam has nothing against it . 
the problem and the prohibition ,  zaheer said ,  arise when it crosses the barrier of decency and turns obscene ,  vulgar and immoral . 
some religious scholars have misunderstood the nature of music and have declared it taboo ,  not realising the basic principles of hadith and its full context ,  zaheer said . 
lahore observes spring festival
traditional dancers perform march <num>12</num>  at the horse and tattoo show in lahore . 
the government is trying to provide entertainment for terrorism-weary citizens . 
 [ amna nasir jamal ] 
lahore ,  pakistan -a two-week-long festival is helping terrorism-weary punjabis greet the advent of spring . 
the lahore festival ,  an annual celebration of spring ,  runs march <num>1</num> -<num>15</num>  .
among the many events are recreational programmes for children ,  a dog show ,  a cricket match between lawmakers and film actors ,  another cricket match for the visually impaired ,  flower-arranging contests ,  poetry readings ,  and face-painting and heena contests . 
but kite flying ,  an activity the government considers fraught with dangerous abuses ,  is absent . 
over the years a number of people have been injured and killed by overly competitive kite flyers . 
at the formal opening of the festival march <num>1</num>  in jillani park ,  sardar zulfiqar ali khan khosa ,  senior adviser to punjab chief minister shabhaz sharif ,  said ,  the government is providing recreational facilities to the people while keeping in view the security situation . 
a folk dance show ,  a concert by the army band and the release of birds and balloons into the air were among the attractions during the opening ceremony . 
the festival has attained international acclaim ,  said javed mahmod ,  chief secretary ,  punjab . 
the spirit behind  ( it )  is to provide entertainment and recreation to the general public during the spring .

the ria novosti news agency has reported that the collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  ,  which includes belarus ,  kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  russia ,  tajikistan ,  and uzbekistan ,  plans to expand cooperation with other international organisations in the fight against drugs . 
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad visits the natanz uranium enrichment facilities april <num>8</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , <num>322</num>  km south of tehran . 
facing a domestic shortage of uranium ,  iran has reportedly sought to secretly buy some from kazakhstan . 
 [ office of the presidency of the islamic republic of iran via getty images ] 
astana - kazakhstan and iran both denied an associated press  ( ap )  report december <num>30</num>  that the two countries were in secret talks for the purchase of <num>1,350</num>  tonnes of processed kazakh uranium . 
despite denials that it is seeking uranium for nuclear weapons ,  experts believe iran has almost run out of processed uranium ore and is seeking additional stocks to build bombs . 
the ap said it obtained a two-page summary of the classified intelligence report ,  prepared by an international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  member country . 
the news agency said the <num>450</num>  $  million deal would be completed in the next few weeks . 
the ap also reported that the summary states kazakh government employees were acting on their own without official approval . 
the statement reiterated that ,  kazakhstan is firmly committed to the principles of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction <abbr>…</abbr>  and remains committed to the principles of the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons ,  relevant resolutions of the united nations security council ,  the un convention on physical protection of nuclear materials ,  as well as the principles and rules of the nuclear suppliers group . 
the western media is often releasing provocative reports against iran ,  but this doesnt mean it is true ,  he said . 
an iaea representative in vienna who asked not to be identified said :  the agency is aware of this claim ,  and there has been some follow-up and contact with the kazakh side . 
the source added :  its not to kazakhstans advantage to sell uranium secretly to iran ,  as kazakhstan is interested in becoming a world leader in this industry . 
iran is running out of yellow cake ,  which is a raw material ,  said jacqueline shire ,  an expert on irans nuclear programs at the institute for science and international security in washington ,  and a former us state department proliferation and weapons specialist . 
according to our calculations they currently have about <num>100</num>  tonnes of it ,  but for full operations in esfahan they need more - about <num>300</num>  tonnes per year . 
shire said the ap story about kazakhstan may or may not be true but that it is believable that iran is seeking new sources of uranium . 
the times of london reported in january <num>2009</num>  that an iaea report found that iran was getting low on uranium ,  and british diplomats had begun lobbying kazakhstan , 
uzbekistan and other uranium producing countries in an effort to prevent iran from replenishing its stocks . 
in december <num>2006</num>  , the un security council imposed sanctions on iran for its uranium enrichment activities and banned the sale of nuclear materials ,  including uranium ,  to iran . 
whoever sells it to them will be violating the un security council resolutions ,  shire said . 
if not in kazakhstan ,  iran can buy the raw material in many places - there are sources in africa ,  in canada ,  in australia . 
but whoever sells it will be violating the resolutions . 
visitors gaze at the abshir-ata waterfall near osh ,  kyrgyzstan . 
reaching the muslim holy site and tourism destination is difficult because of bad roads . 
osh ,  kyrgyzstan -in a scenic valley surrounded by fruit and nut trees is the muslim holy place of abshir-ata ,  known to the faithful across central asia . 
the only problem ,  travel agent lada khasanova said ,  is getting there . 
this place could bring the government revenue if the authorities built normal roads ,  said khasanova ,  owner of osh travel . 
she said many people want to visit abshir-ata ,  about <num>100</num>  km from osh . 
the faithful pray at the abshir-ata spring for healing - mostly for skin disorders . 
across from the spring is a cave in the wall of a gorge where pilgrims pray . 
the tourists come for the natural beauty of a waterfall fed by an underground river . 
it emerges from the mouth of a cave and plunges <num>35</num>  metres . 
sheikh islmail-ajy ,  the keeper of the holy place sitting at the entrance of the cave ,  said ,  the ritual of worship at abshir-ata includes bathing in the holy waters and necessarily includes going up to the waterfall and praying in the caves . 
khasanova said she often brings foreigners to abshir-ata ,  including pilgrims from muslim countries ,  and tourists from elsewhere . 
according to the osh oblast government website ,  more than <num>100,000</num>  tourists from <num>15</num>  countries visit osh tourist sites annually . 
while the website says the government is interested in foreign partners to lift the tourism industry to an international level ,  khasanova says the government has done little to develop the area . 
if only the authorities would build normal roads and local residents could get work in the structures that accompany such tourist facilities . 
though the road is worn out ,  worshippers come by the thousands until the winter snow cuts abshir-ata off from the outside world . 
the dirt road climbs into the mountains and zigzags through a narrow valley ,  crossing the river several times . 
the bridges were built by wealthy local people . 
in front of each ,  an inscribed plaque says who donated the money for that bridge . 
ergesh suyunbayev ,  a resident of a village in the valley ,  said that without these bridges the valley would be cut off from the world all year . 
the rich countrymen didnt stop to wait for the goodness of the authorities and ,  with the money they earned in the big world ,  they built the bridges themselves . 
without them ,  there would be fewer worshippers and tourists . 
and that means we would not be able to earn even a little money ,  he said . 
another resident ,  who declined to give his name ,  said ,  the authorities expressly do not want to build roads because they fear an increase in the number of pilgrims ,  which means the possible transformation of nearby villages in the valley into hotbeds of religious extremism . 
bride kidnapping returns in central asia
a kazakh couple weds in a typical zags marriage registry ceremony in almaty . 
the old custom of kidnapping women for marriage has returned to parts of central asia . 
 [ timur batyrshin ] 
karakalpakstan ,  uzbekistan - nadyra torekulova thought nothing was amiss one day some <num>10</num>  years ago when she accepted a ride home from a young man who had proposed marriage to her . 
in his home there was always a fight . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  we lived together for nine months . 
i left for my home four times and came back . 
the fifth time i left for good . 
kidnapping for marriage has been reported in kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan ,  but according to knowledgeable sources does not seem to occur in tajikistan . 
an expert from tajikistan who wished to remain anonymous ,  said bride-stealing there occurs primarily among traditionally nomadic peoples . 
marfua tokhtakhajayeva ,  an uzbek researcher of gender issues ,  said several reasons explain the revival of the tradition . 
the cost of a wedding is high . 
often the groom has no money ,  and the brides dowry isnt enough . 
the future groom agrees with his friends to steal the bride . 
… a difference in educational level may become a reason to bride-nap . 
educated families want to intermarry with similar families and ,  as a rule ,  if the groom is not educated ,  they will refuse him . 
in uzbekistan ,  the tradition of abducting women for marriage mostly occurs in karakalpakstan . 
such marriages are not officially registered at the zags  ( civil registry )  . 
the kazakh criminal code provides for five to eight years in prison for bride-napping . 
victoriya saveleva ,  a consultant with the association of mass media  ( assotsiatsiya smi )  in taraz ,  kazakhstan ,  admitted that bride-kidnapping happens . 
but she believes such cases occur if the bride desires it . 
i felt humiliation ,  anger ,  resentment and ,  finally ,  resignation to my fate <abbr>…</abbr>  what could i do ,  asel asked . 
probably ,  i could only commit suicide ,  but that is not a way out . 
ruslan ,  <num>31</num>  , who lives in suburban almaty ,  said that in rural areas not only kazakhs ,  but also caucasians living in compact groups in kazakhstan ,  often resort to such methods . 
before they steal the bride ,  candidates for the title of future husband very carefully study the girl and her family ,  said ruslan . 
kazakh ministry of internal affairs officials said law enforcement agencies have not received complaints of bride-napping . 
according to human rights watch  ( hrw )  ,  bride-napping in kyrgyzstan continues to be an unresolved problem . 
in a report titled :  reconciled to violence :  state failure to stop domestic abuse and abduction of women in kyrgyzstan ,  hrw concludes that even in the presence of progressive legislation in kyrgyzstan ,  law enforcement agencies fail to enforce it . 
as a result ,  women continue to be exposed to danger and remain without legal protection . 
a representative of the bishkek police ,  who asked to remain anonymous ,  said ,  abducted girls and their families rarely call the police . 
it is considered a disgrace if the stolen girl returns home . 
rumours can spread that her husband returned her himself because she was impure . 
even if we receive complaints from stolen women ,  the cases practically never make it to the courts . 
typically ,  the girls parents convince her to come to terms with it . 
afghan army demonstrates progress during kabul attacks
kabul - despite the success of the january <num>18</num>  attacks in kabul by afghan taliban militants that left a dozen people dead ,  several analysts said they believe the actions by the afghan national army  ( ana )  prevented the attack from being far worse . 
we have to be proud of our afghan security forces for what they did today ,  afghan interior minister hanif atmar said january <num>18</num>  in examining the fallout of the attacks . 
although some military analysts criticize the current afghan national armys ability ,  afghan defence officials and at least two other analysts claim the capabilities of the ana have significantly improved over the past few years ,  as demonstrated by mondays attacks . 
the recent attack on kabul by militants proved that afghanistans national army is capable of handling such situations ,  said nabi misdaq ,  an afghan journalist and author of afghanistan :  political frailty and foreign interference . 
a number of people are well-trained and well-equipped in the national army . 
thomas goutierre ,  director of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> -based center for afghan studies ,  applauded the anas efforts . 
some of the strategies used  ( by the ana )  kept this from getting truly out of hand ,  he said in an interview with central asia online . 
this could have been far worse . 
much of the information provided by the government in the hours after the attack seems to provide proof of that assessment . 
atmar said in a press conference late january <num>18</num>  that similar attacks in kabul last year killed <num>27</num>  people and left many other injured . 
this time ,  he said ,  the number of causalities was significantly lower . 
early in the day kabul is heavily crowded ,  but shortly after the attacks ,  all city stores were closed and only the security forces were seen on the roads . 
afghanistan interior ministry spokesperson ,  zemari bashari told central asia online no foreign troops were involved in the operations against the attackers . 
gouttiere said this be viewed as vindication of recent actions taken by afghan and allied security forces against the taliban . 
he said the january <num>18</num>  attack was not quite as well-organized as those in the past . 
this was an effort by those who are being attacked by security forces to create diversion and take the attack back to the government . 
still ,  at least one political analyst said mondays attack serves as a reminder that the taliban is far from gone . 
goutierre and misdaq agreed . 
the need for consistent security remains a top concern for anyone operating in afghanistan ,  goutierre said . 
there have been enough recent attacks to suggest this is still a significant issue . 
misdaq said that while the ana is proving its worth ,  it will still need outside help for some time to come . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  keeping such a huge army  ( <num>97,000</num>  )  now ,  and <num>10,000</num>  more in the coming days ,  will not be possible for afghanistan  ( alone )  due to economic hardships ,  he said . 
without the support of international community ,  it will not be possible for afghanistan to keep such a huge and costly army . 
government officials ,  tribal elders reject militants claims of their support for him
islamabad -- government officials ,  defence analysts and tribal elders have strongly criticised claims made by militant leader siraj-u-din haqqani in a recent interview with al-jazeera television . 
he asked why residents of the tribal region ,  whose brethren are suffering atrocities by the taliban ,  would support them . 
 [ haqqani ]  is just boasting and making false claims ,  ayaz said . 
defence analysts ,  when asked about haqqanis video on al-jazeera ,  told central asia online it was a public relations campaign by the taliban leader . 
its an image-building exercise and needs to be discouraged by the media organisations too ,  ayaz says . 
malik amanullah kansi ,  head of the balochistan tribal jirga and committee ,  agreed . 
in my view ,  the haqqani group is just propagandising against pakistan for its own purposes . 
all its claims are false ,  he told central asia online . 
bacha khan zadran ,  tribal elder and the kabul representative of the tripartite commission ,  said ,  i categorically reject the claims of the terrorists that they are being supported by the tribal elders across the border between pakistan and afghanistan . 
i am not sure about the role of intelligence agencies operating on pakistans side ,  but i am sure about all the tribes ,  and that they are not supporting any terrorist organisation ,  zadran said . 
maulana abdul wasay ,  a senior minister and jamiat ulema-e- islam  ( fazal )  parliamentary leader in the balochistan assembly ,  told central asia online ,  we deny the claim that pakistani officials and tribal leaders are supporting the taliban fighting against <abbr>…</abbr>  allied forces in afghanistan . 
i deny reports that tribal leaders are supporting the taliban . 
we have been the biggest victims of the war against terrorism ,  said nawabzada mehboob khan jogezai ,  a well-known tribal head of balochistan . 
jogezai said ,  pakistani tribal leaders have no link to the taliban . 
whether theyre in afghanistan or pakistan ,  we are not supporting any terrorist organisation across the border . 
ayaz derided taliban claims of victory against coalition forces . 
victory means holding ones ground ,  ayaz said . 
they just stage hit-and-run attacks that any criminal band can do . 
ayaz also rejected the charge by siraj-u-din haqqani that pakistan was following a western agenda . 
pakistan is presently pursuing an independent policy in the war against terror ,  and its dealing with insurgents in the tribal belt and other areas ,  he said . 
we strongly condemn this statement . 
pakistan is playing the role of a front-line state in the war against terror  ( and )  these elements are trying to perturb it ,  he said . 
zadran explained that by saying ,  tribal elders are peace-loving people ,  and they will not support any extremist and terrorist move ,  we support only national governments ,  not any terrorist organisation . 
malik khalid khan ,  a member of the tribal committee in balochistan ,  told central asia online ,  i think  ( the video )  is one of those steps taken by anti-pakistan elements to divert the war against terror <abbr>…</abbr>  taliban leader sirajuddin haqqani is hiding the fact that they are playing into foreign hands against pakistan . 
there are no militia movement roots in ethnic pashtun tribal traditions . 
it is wrong to claim that the taliban fighting in afghanistan are being supported by tribal leaders . 
we have always condemned all terrorist activities . 
khan said the video was an attempt to cause trouble for dwellers of the tribal regions by falsely accusing them of supporting terror networks . 
sirajuddin haqqani ,  a warlord with a network of fighters in north waziristan ,  is trying to make his focus on balochistan work .

education makes comeback in afghanistan
girls and boys read at a kabul school . 
after the fall of the taliban in afghanistan ,  the education sector has improved ,  but the government has set higher goals to be reached by <num>2020</num>  .
 [ sediq amarkhil ] 
decades of war ,  civil unrest and political instability destroyed basic social services in the country . 
education was one casualty . 
now the country has a plan to further improve the system by <num>2020</num>  .
wardak said the country has seen major progress in enhancing the quality of education . 
nearly <num>7</num>  meter  children are enrolled in schools ;  around <num>37</num>  percent ,  or <num>2.5</num>  meter  ,  of them are girls ,  he said . 
other improvements include the construction of <num>4,500</num>  school buildings that provide better and safer learning environments and more than an eightfold increase in the number of teachers to <num>170,000</num>  , <num>30</num>  percent of whom are female ,  he said . 
under the taliban ,  there were no standard national curriculum or textbooks ;  only four teacher training centres  ( ttcs )  with <num>400</num>  students ;  and only <num>1,500</num>  boys enrolled in technical and vocational schools . 
there were <num>220</num>  unregulated madrassas that lacked a formal curriculum . 
according to the education ministry figures ,  <num>42</num>  ttcs are active now ,  with at least one per province ,  and they have male and female boarding facilities . 
there are <num>42</num>  centres of educational excellence with registered madrassas ,  assadullah ,  a madrassa student ,  said . 
before ,  people used to go to pakistan for islamic studies ,  but now we are happy that the ministry of education provides facilities for islamic studies here in afghanistan .

helmand residents welcome operation as taliban flee

as afghan and international troops began retaking the region of helmand province february <num>13</num>  , residents of marjah say they welcome the operation to re-establish government control . 
 [ patrick baz / afp / getty images ] 
the operation was launched early february <num>13</num>  after weeks of extensive publicity that included press conferences and dropping leaflets in the area to avoid civilian casualties and give insurgents a chance to lay down their arms . 
around <num>6,000</num>  troops - a majority of them afghan soldiers - attacked the town of marjah ,  which had been under control of extremists for nearly three years . 
the operation includes large numbers of afghan soldiers and police ,  as well as international forces . 
helmand governor gulab mangal told reporters a total of <num>15,000</num>  afghan and international troops are taking part in the operation in the marjah and nad ali districts . 
afghan defence minister ,  rahim wardag ,  said the afghan national army  ( ana )  and coalition forces are facing little resistance from the taliban militants . 
he told a kabul press conference late saturday the taliban are trying to use local residents as human shields ,  but the ana and coalition forces are proceeding carefully to avoid civilian casualties . 
residents of marjah say they welcome the operation and describe their conditions under the taliban as horrible . 
there were no roads ,  no clinic ,  no school ,  no job ,  nothing at all . 
we lived under horrible conditions . 
we hoped the government would come and rescue us . 
he added that the villagers are happy that the government is taking action as the town has been ruined by insurgent activities . 
we want to cooperate with our government ,  the army ,  the police . 
we need roads ,  clinics ,  schools ,  jobs ,  not war ,  hekmatullah added . 
helmand governor mangal said earlier in the week that government representatives would quickly move into the areas once they are secured and begin re-establishing the government and reconstruction . 
taliban spokesman ,  qari yousuf ahmadi ,  first termed the operation as just a propaganda war ,  but later claimed that they were gathering fighters to defend their stronghold . 
however ,  afghan officials said there has been little resistance so far . 
there is no significant resistance so far ,  dawod ahmadi ,  spokesman to the governor of helmand ,  told central asia online . 
the only problem our forces are facing is hundreds of mines that the insurgents have implanted on roads and everywhere in the town . 
the man put the number of the displaced families at <num>500</num>  , but ahmadi told central asia online that at least <num>550</num>  families were displaced . 
we are helping the displaced people ;  things of basic needs are being distributed among them ,  he added . 
the town has a population of <num>80,000</num>  people . 
in the early hours of the operation five insurgents were killed and eight captured alive ,  ahmadi ,  said . 
he said this operation was going slowly so as to protect civilians and to protect military forces from roadside bombs . 
the operation seems to be a crucial part of the new multi-faceted strategy to first change the taliban momentum and then offer them reconciliation . 
nato officials say it will continue for several weeks ,  probably until the upcoming peace jirga that ,  according to waheed omar ,  spokesman to president karzai ,  will be held in kabul in april . 
taliban pushed from helmand positions as fighting continues
marjah ,  afghanistan - afghan and international forces are dislodging taliban militants from positions in marjah and nad ali in afghanistans helmand province ,  and have retaken a majority of both areas ,  according to news reports february <num>15</num>  .
a government spokesman told news media february <num>15</num>  that afghan and international forces had largely contained militant fighters and that no movement of taliban forces was taking place . 
as operation moshtarak entered its third day ,  troops in marjah found their progress impeded by roadside bombs ,  mines and sniper fire . 
local residents are helping troops locate explosives ,  according to the bbc news website . 
mcchrystal called afghan president hamid karzai to apologise and suspended the use of the missiles . 
to minimise the threat to civilians and give militants a chance to lay down their arms ,  the coalition announced the operation in advance . 
many civilians left the area . 
afghan residents of the area have looked past the risks to express support for the operation . 
we want to see you ,  as you are claiming ,  to bring stability to our region ,  one unidentified farmer told rfe / rl . 
we are happy  [ at the offensive ]  ,  but we expect you not to harm us or pain and humiliate us . 
we expect this and will accept this ,  and it will make us happy "  . 
gulab mangal ,  governor of helmand province ,  said last week the military operation would take a month . 
he said that as the coalition secures areas ,  government representatives will begin reconstruction and development programmes . 
kunar youth graduate from nangarhar university
eighty-two young people from kunar province recently graduated from nangarhar university . 
local leaders ,  parliamentarians and professors from kabul and nangarhar universities attended a ceremony in asadabad to honour the graduates on august <num>2</num>  .
one source of local pride was the lone female graduate . 
zitoon was the only female this year ,  but she was optimistic that more women will seek education next year . 
it is a happy moment for kunar people that kunar has a female student among the graduates ,  she said . 
zitoon appealed to females in kunar to pursue higher education ,  and to work for the development of the country . 
i will participate in development programmes for our country alongside my brothers ,  she said . 
it is a great opportunity for kunar province that it has so many students from different areas of study ,  he told the crowd . 
recently ,  at a school in kabul ,  kai eide ,  the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  special representative for afghanistan ,  spoke of the importance of educating afghanistans youth . 
kunars governor said fazlullah wahidi emphasised the importance of education to the development of the province ,  and pledged to do his best to find employment for the graduates in kunar . 
our province will benefit from your knowledge and understanding ,  he told them . 
you are young ,  and you have an education now and the capacity to work well . 
majahid shorash is one of the graduates . 
he also spoke of civic duty . 
nangarhar university is afghanistans second largest university with about <num>3,500</num>  students . 
it is located in jalalabad ,  in neighbouring nangarhar province ,  and is the most popular choice for graduates of secondary school in kunar . 
this years graduating class is the largest from kunar since the fall of the taliban regime . 
helmand taliban reportedly short on ammunition
afghan soldiers lead away a suspected taliban militant captured february <num>18</num>  in marjah ,  helmand province . 
as a major operation entered its sixth day ,  forces continued to dislocate taliban fighters . 
marjah - military commanders reported february <num>18</num>  that efforts to expel taliban fighters are moving slowly ,  but intercepted communications suggest extremists are running low on ammunition . 
the bbc news website reported that in intercepted communications ,  taliban commanders in marjah have called for additional support ,  suggesting they are running low on ammunition as they attempt to hold areas in helmand against a joint operation of afghan national army and coalition forces . 
operation moshtarak  ( together )  began february <num>13</num>  and has deployed some <num>6,000</num>  afghan and coalition troops to drive the taliban out of marjah ,  a key opium poppy cultivation centre . 
the taliban rely on revenue from the cultivation and sale of opium ,  and on donations from the middle east ,  to fund their insurgency . 
reports of taliban fighters using civilians as human shields continue to surface . 
afghan and coalition forces reported thursday they are still facing sniper fire . 
mines and improvised explosive devices are also slowing progress in retaking marjah . 
the coalition delivered a  " school-in-a-box "  to the village of naquelabad kalay ,  and some <num>250</num>  residents signed up for paid employment to repair a drainage system and construct a footbridge in the area ,  coalition sources said . 
some <num>1,400</num>  families have fled the fighting ,  according to the un . 
to address their needs ,  and those of other afghans ,  the un has issued a call for governments and donor organisations to provide some us <num>1,400</num>  to fund health ,  nutrition ,  water and other humanitarian programmes during <num>2010</num>  .
a convoy of afghan police prepare to leave shorabak camp for marjah in nad-e ali ,  helmand province ,  february <num>19</num>  .
the police will help re-establish civil authority in areas cleared of taliban insurgents . 
marjah ,  afghanistan - as operation moshtarak entered its seventh day ,  afghan national army  ( ana )  and coalition troops continued to encounter resistance . 
a military commander warned that clearing marjah of taliban fighters could take another month . 
even though battlefield progress has been slow ,  authorities have begun efforts to stabilise and re-establish civil authority in the marjah and nad-e ali areas in helmand province . 
those efforts include projects to repair irrigation systems and establish schools . 
yet efforts are already under way to stabilise those areas that coalition forces have cleared of taliban gunmen . 
two  " schools-in-a-box "  ,  which provide educational and support materials for a teacher and <num>25</num>  students ,  have been set up in nad-e ali . 
authorities are identifying a site for a deputy district governor's office ,  and afghan police were preparing to enter areas of marjah february <num>19</num>  that troops had secured . 
mindful of the need to listen to and work with the local population ,  ana troops have held a number of well-attended shuras in recent days to hear the concerns of elders and local residents . 
a tribal leader told the bbc pashto service february <num>18</num>  that involving the local population is essential to establishing and maintaining security in the area . 
 " as long as you don't get local people involved in the security ,  you will not be able to protect this area ,  "  haji abdurahman sabir told the bbc . 
tajik ruling party wins <num>71.7</num>  %  of the vote
tajik president emomali rakhmon votes in parliamentary elections february <num>28</num>  .
his peoples democratic party of tajikistan won <num>71.7</num>  %  of the vote . 
some opposition parties plan to challenge the results . 
 [ rukhshona ibragimova ] 
dushanbe - the ruling party won in tajikistan ,  but opposition parties and western observers are questioning the conduct of the elections . 
the peoples democratic party of tajikistan  ( ndpt )  ,  headed by president emomali rakhmon ,  received <num>71.7</num>  %  of the vote in parliamentary elections february <num>28</num>  , according to preliminary results released march <num>1</num>  by the central commission for elections and referenda  ( cec )  . 
the cec said four other parties - including the islamic renaissance party  ( pivt )  ,  which received <num>7.7</num>  %  of the votes - won seats . 
according to cec director mirzoali boltuyev ,  other parties that exceeded the <num>5</num>  %  vote requirement for seats in parliament include the communist party  ( <num>7.22</num>  %  )  ,  the agrarian party of tajikistan  ( <num>5.01</num>  %  )  and the economic reform party  ( <num>5.09</num>  %  )  . 
the rest of the political parties -- the social-democrats  ( sdpt )  ,  the democrats and the socialists -- received less than <num>1</num>  %  of the votes ,  boltuyev said . 
while the president said the necessary conditions to achieve these goals were provided ,  opposition parties voiced their displeasure with the conduct of the elections and the results . 
our representatives at the commissions were provided with certified copies of the results by 10p ,  and the following morning there were new results with completely different numbers ,  he said . 
kabiri ,  though disputing the results ,  said this campaign was much more positive than in <num>2005</num>  .
violations were far greater that year ,  he said . 
but sdpt chairman rahmatillo zoyirov differed with kabiri ,  telling central asia online the government was more intrusive this year than in <num>2005</num>  .
the organisation for security and co-operation in europe  ( osce )  expressed its own disappointment with the elections . 
the parliamentary elections in tajikistan ,  while demonstrating some progress ,  still do not respond to the many key responsibilities the republic has before the osce ,  said pia christmas-moller ,  vice-president of the parliamentary assembly of the osce . 
christmas-moller said state television practically ignored the pre-election campaign and thus hindered voters from making an informed choice at the polls . 
she also decried group and family voting ,  where one person votes for residents of a building or an extended family . 
salima rasulova of dushanbe told central asia online she came to vote later than her parents did . 
when i came up to members of the commission to receive my ballot ,  it turned out my father had voted for our entire family ,  she said . 
the commission was unable to explain why this happened . 
after some discussion ,  it gave me a ballot . 
the cis and shanghai co-operation organisation observers gave high marks to the parliamentary elections . 
if there were isolated violations of the voting regime ,  in part attempts at family voting ,  they were not widespread and could not have altered the results of the election ,  sergei lebedev ,  head of the cis mission ,  said . 
the opposition pivt and sdpt plan to file a lawsuit to challenge the election outcome . 
if our claims and complaints are not examined and taken into consideration ,  we intend to take tougher measures within the law ,  including demonstrations ,  kabiri said . 
islamic scholar issues fatwa against terror ,  suicide bombings
there is no place for any martyrdom and their act is never ,  ever to be considered jihad . 
qadri also rejected the view put forth by scholars who argue that using violence in the conflict between israel and the palestinians is an exceptional situation where suicide attacks can be justified . 
he said there were no situations under which acts of vengeance ,  such as attacks on market places or commuter trains ,  could ever be considered a justifiable act of war ,  the bbc reported . 
the pakistani-born islamic scholar and sufi has published some <num>400</num>  books ,  and is the founding leader of minhaj ul quran international ,  an international organisation working to create understanding between communities ,  and to educate young people in classical islamic sciences to promote peace . 
clash between taliban and hizb-e-islami kills <num>70</num>  militants in afghanistan
afghan president hamid karzai talks to reporters march <num>7</num>  after meeting with local elders in marjah in the southern province of helmand ,  afghanistan . 
seventy members of hizb-e-islami and the taliban were killed fighting each other march <num>7</num>  in baghlan province . 
a resident of the area who asked for anonymity told central asia online that the fighting erupted early march <num>6</num>  in the baghlan-e-markazi district of the province . 
many families have fled the area because of the fierce fighting between the two groups ,  he added . 
colonel mohammad amin mangal ,  a provincial police official ,  confirmed the incident and said the fierce fighting was ongoing . 
a local taliban commander reportedly said that the hizb-e-islami fighters were creating problems for the local population ,  leading the taliban to strike . 
however ,  a provincial official told central asia online that fighters from hizb-e-islami were on their way to the provincial centre to reconcile with the government when the taliban attacked them . 
baghlan is a northern province and increasingly insecure because of the growth of insurgent activities . 
the area where the fighting occurred is 5km from the district centre . 
under taliban rule ,  the taliban and hizb-e-islami ,  led by gulbuddin hekmatyar ,  were hostile to one another from <num>1995</num>  until <num>2001</num>  .
later that year ,  a faction of hizb-e-islami joined the new government of president hamid karzai . 
one of its members ,  abdul hadi arghandiwal ,  is a minister in the cabinet . 
but another faction led by hekmatyar joined the insurgency and had claimed to be co-operating with the taliban . 
recently ,  news reports said that representatives of hekmatyar were in contact with the afghan government about a possible reconciliation . 
in the south of the country ,  karzai visited marjah ,  the town where thousands of coalition and afghan troops have concluded their biggest operation this year . 
dawood ahmadi ,  spokesman for the provincial governor ,  told central asia online that the president met with more than <num>200</num>  elders and discussed upcoming reconstruction programmes with them . 
the elders assured him of their support and co-operation . 
ahmadi added that the commander of the nato forces accompanied the president . 
tajik drug fighters train afghan colleagues
dushanbe - thirty-five afghan police officers recently completed a week-long course in dushanbe to learn how to bust their countrys narcotics racket . 
the programme ,  co-sponsored by the organization for security and cooperation in europe  ( osce )  and tajikistans interior ministry and national drug control agency  ( dca )  ,  is meant to teach the afghans how to conduct a search for narcotics - starting with the investigation and ending in the courtroom . 
our tajik colleagues <abbr>…</abbr>  can teach us a thing or two ,  abdulmannon zurmati of the afghan drug control unit told central asia online . 
he said the tajiks enjoy widespread respect for their prowess in tackling drug smugglers . 
our goal is to give afghan police officers the basic skills of fighting drug traffic ,  said dca senior inspector and instructor abdulkamol sulaimonov . 
after returning home ,  the trainees will share their newly acquired knowledge with colleagues in their respective provinces . 
this training programme is the first of its kind in the region ,  sulaimonov said . 
we hope to continue training afghan law enforcement officers ,  since their work efficiency directly impacts the drug trafficking situation in tajikistan ,  he said . 
we wrote a special guide in farsi for the afghan police officers ,  and did our best to select instructors with long work records in afghanistan ,  sulaimonov said . 
we not only teach but learn ,  although the general level of afghan policemens drug-fighting skills is still notably lower than ours . 
according to sulaimonov ,  one of the afghan police officers strengths is their proficiency in exchanging information . 
with what little experience they have ,  they work in a fairly well-coordinated manner ,  he said . 
all the agencies that have at least something to do with drug fighting stay in permanent contact . 
afghanistan has many dogs trained to search for landmines but has none to search for drugs ,  he said . 
the dca specialists also showed their afghan counterparts a mobile screening device . 
it enables customs officers to check trucks and cars without having to unload them . 
we still have nothing like the special equipment the tajik police have at their disposal ,  said another afghan trainee who asked to remain unidentified . 
yes ,  foreign donor countries and international charities allocate considerable funds <abbr>…</abbr>  but those funds somehow fail to reach their destination . 
the greater part of afghan territory is currently beyond government control ,  he said . 
the terrorist <abbr>…</abbr>  groups with a strong foothold in southern afghan provinces have been giving monetary injections to opium-growing peasants . 
hopefully ,  the training of instructors to teach afghan police officers will continue in tajikistan . 
the tajiks are conducting the course in line with a <num>2007</num>  decision by the osce to increase its involvement in afghanistan . 
dushanbe organised the training with assistance from the strategic police matters unit and with funding by the japanese government . 
imu becomes multinational force
captured uzbek and afghan militants in the custody of security forces at kohat in nwfp ,  pakistan in october <num>2008</num>  .
the islamic movement of uzbekistan is the largest radical islamic organisation in central asia and continues to receive support from abroad . 
 [ tariq mahmood / afp / getty images ] 
the views of the author do not necessarily reflect those of central asia online
dushanbe ,  tajikistan -- the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  - the largest radical islamic organisation in post-soviet central asia - has significantly transformed its activities ,  ideology and tactics in the four years since its establishment in <num>2006</num>  .
but of significant concern ,  is its transformation from a local organisation of uzbek political migrants into a multinational extremist political-military organisation with a jihadist nature . 
in interviews ,  tahir yuldashev ,  the founder and main leader of the imu ,  has proudly called himself and his supporters enemies of jews and christians . 
but the overthrow of the taliban ruined these plans ,  leaving the imu with major losses and forcing it to relocate to pakistan and turning it into a group of international mercenaries . 
with its headquarters and military bases presently located in north waziristan ,  pakistan ,  the imu is distanced from its principal social base and is unable to establish a bridgehead for a direct attack on the uzbek border . 
this has been causing internal strife between many imu leaders and the majority of militants . 
imu leaders are focused on the international black market and drug trafficking ,  while the militant memberships ambitions remain bound to uzbekistan alone . 
disagreements about the organisations future strategies erupted and have divided the imu into three factions . 
the first faction has tahir yuldashev at its head . 
the second is a group called the islamic jihad union under the command of nadzhmiddin yahya jalolov ,  which has entered into al-qaedas ranks . 
that goal does ,  however ,  coincide with al-qaedas ambitions to promote jihad outside afghanistan . 
as a result ,  the imu once again has favourable conditions for concentrating its efforts directly in uzbekistan . 
this involves the transfer of funds and militants into the region . 
the second stage is for the imu to infiltrate uzbekistan and to create clandestine cells ,  ammunition depots ,  <abbr>etc.</abbr> 
the imus funding sources can be divided into several categories . 
first are the descendants of uzbeks who emigrated in the <num>1920</num>  second  living in islamic countries . 
according to arab sources ,  uzbek emigrants such as the margilani family in saudi arabia are sources of private funding . 
according to some reports ,  the uzbek diaspora in saudi arabia numbers some <num>300,000</num>  people . 
additionally ,  the regions intelligence agencies say that the imu has close ties with a number of turkish foundations and islamist and pan-turkic organisations . 
these include the fundamentalist milli gerush vakfi  ( registered in cologne )  ,  the middle east turkic union ,  the great eastern islamic raiders front ,  the roots of islamic order - which operates under the party of great unity - the fundamentalist organisation nizami alem odjakli ,  <abbr>etc.</abbr> 
according to russian and central asian intelligence agencies ,  from the beginning the imu has received substantial support from pakistans inter-services intelligence agency . 
however recent pakistani military offensives and arrests of militants may signal this relationship has changed or ended . 
the taliban and al-qaeda ,  along with sympathetic foundations and banks in saudi arabia and the arab world ,  also remain major imu sponsors . 
finally ,  the imu has its own ways to make money ,  including drug trafficking ,  racketeering ,  and solicitation of donations abroad . 
whatever its many problems ,  the imu continues to raise the funds it needs . 
uzbek political life is characterised by the almost complete lack of a dominant secular opposition . 
however ,  the imu presently has no real chance at seizing power . 
soviet-influenced uzbek society remains largely secular and unreceptive to religious extremism . 
and the imus lack of a territorial bridgehead near uzbekistan blocks it from staging a large-scale guerrilla war .

iran follows dangerous two-faced strategy in afghanistan
london - the international security assistance force  ( isaf )  watched as a convoy crossed the border from eastern iran to farah province in western afghanistan . 
the explosives carried marks indicating that they were made in iran ,  similar to charges that they were the weapon of choice for insurgents targeting foreign forces in iraq between <num>2004</num>  and <num>2008</num>  .
the farah province incident took place on september <num>5</num>  , <num>2007</num>  .
it offered the strongest evidence that iranian parties that supported the insurgents in iraq apparently started doing the same thing in afghanistan . 
the british ,  part of the isaf force that confiscated the farah convoy load ,  quickly lodged a protest through diplomatic channels with iranian authorities . 
they had been losing soldiers targeted by these explosive charges in nearby helmand province . 
the iranians said they could not be the party supporting the taliban . 
to prove their point ,  they could argue that this sunni is hostile toward shia ,  citing the <num>1995</num>  killing by taliban members of abdul ali mazari ,  the leader of the shia afghan unity party . 
reports said he was thrown from a helicopter ,  but the taliban said he was trying to flee while he was being transferred from kabul to kandahar . 
the iranians could point to the killing of iranian diplomats by the taliban after their consulate was raided in mazari sharif in northern afghanistan on august 8th ,  <num>1998</num>  , something that would make the notion of irans support for the taliban unlikely . 
another argument the iranians could make is the difficulty of controlling the <num>1,000</num>  kilometer  long iranian-afghan border and preventing smuggling through illegal crossing points . 
but the official iranian denial was made by iranian diplomats who might not have really known whether their country was involved in backing the insurgents in afghanistan . 
this is a security issue that is usually handled by iranian intelligence services and the islamic revolution guards corps  ( irgc )  . 
in iraq ,  it was the irgcs quds that was tasked with supporting the shia rebels who waged a guerilla war against the british forces ,  especially in southern iraq . 
in any case ,  it is unlikely that the british believed the iranian denial . 
the foreign and commonwealth office  ( minister of state at fco then kim howels )  wrote a letter on december <num>13</num>  , <num>2007</num>  to the house of commons foreign affairs committee ,  saying that there is considerable evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of the equipment being used by insurgents against uk forces in iraq is of iranian origin ,  or at least has been transited through iran . 
any iranian links to illegal armed groups either through supply of munitions ,  training or funding are completely unacceptable ,  the statement read . 
british condemnation of iranian conduct did not stop arms shipments to the taliban . 
these shipments were made lighter ,  and international forces might not have seized them because they were smuggled . 
the parties that shipped the arms may have decided that they should not be of the same size that was received by the iraqi groups . 
british analysts believe that parties in the iranian regime - specifically the irgc - wanted only to engage the international forces in a war of attrition in afghanistan ,  without letting the taliban achieve a victory that would constitute a threat to the security of iran in the future . 
they note that ,  in addition to its low-intensity support for the taliban ,  iran had actually provided clear support for the government of afghan president hamid karzai ,  even though most of irans aid went to specific areas where the shia hazara ethnicity lives in central and northern afghanistan . 
substantial economic growth was recorded in the hazara areas after years of stagnation  ( <num>1995</num> -<num>2001</num>  )  caused by harassment from the taliban ,  which considered the hazara complicit in acting against their move to control central and northern afghanistan in <num>1997</num>  and <num>1998</num>  .
the issue faded over the past two years . 
the world was occupied with the iranian nuclear programme and the conflicts within the iranian regime following the controversial presidential election last summer . 
however ,  british channel <num>4</num>  raised this issue again last week . 
the channel aired a report that revealed the taliban received tons of iranian arms - mines ,  bombs and plastic explosives . 
these were smuggled across the border ,  especially through herat province ,  near farah province . 
the report also said a large amount of land mines that were seized carried iranian serial numbers ,  which confirms undeniably that they were produced by the iranian arm-manufacturing industries . 
the significance of this report is that it denies iranians the ability to claim these mines are received from another country even if smugglers shipped them to afghanistan across the iranian territories . 
this evidence might seem difficult to refute ,  but this did not prevent the iranian embassy in london from issuing a categorical denial . 
taliban fighters are enemies to iran and killed several iranian diplomats in afghanistan in the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  the statement said . 
the iranian embassy said that the islamic republic pursued a policy based on supporting security and peace in afghanistan because this affected security and peace in iran itself . 
the embassy said that the new allegations about the iranian arms to the afghan movement were fabricated . 
regardless of the official iranian position ,  there is no doubt that the quantities of arms seized while on their way to the taliban are only the tip of the iceberg . 
other quantities must have been smuggled without being seized across the vast border between the two countries . 
in its letter to the foreign affairs committee at the house of common in <num>2007</num>  , the foreign and commonwealth office said that iran was following a dangerous and two-faced strategy in afghanistan . 
while aid is being given to this country by building its capacity and supporting its economy ,  it provides at the same time money ,  arms and training to the taliban . 
the exact british words ,  three years ago ,  could well be repeated in <num>2010</num>  .
irans policy - or at least that of some of its leaders - is constant in a changing world .

almaty -- snowmelt flooding has inundated the tarbagarysky district of eastern kazakh oblast ,  forcing thousands from their homes and businesses march <num>24</num>  , while others prepare for more floods . 
according to the oblasts emergency situations department spokesman evgeny shaturnyi ,  flooding has destroyed more than <num>900</num>  homes and businesses and inundated hundreds of others .

scholars worry that those who receive an incorrect version of the islamic canon might fall under the influence of radical groups . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
bishkek - clerics might be spreading dangerous misinformation ,  wittingly or not ,  in kyrgyzstan . 
the number of educated clerics in kyrgyzstans mosques is steadily decreasing ,  and scholars worry that misinterpretations of islam could lead to an increase in the number of radicals . 
the question on the religious communitys mind is :  how can we convey the true meaning of islam ? 
kadyr malikov ,  head of the independent research centre religion ,  law and politics ,  said some distortion of the quran are intentional . 
when they cannot recruit people ,  they mislead them ,  he said of extremist groups . 
and manas kurmanbayev ,  a member of a muslim initiative group ,  said that uneducated imams can fall under the influence of radical groups . 
national security consultant toktogul kakchekeyev said ,  many people are now willing to fight for things that were never in the quran . 
this is quite dangerous… one example is that of melis ,  who arrived in the capital a few months ago . 
he locked his wife ,  gulmairam ,  in the home ,  arguing that according to the quran ,  women cannot work . 
they should sit at home and take care of the family hearth . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  in my hometown ,  not a single woman goes to work . 
supreme mufti murataly ajy jumanov said this is just wrong . 
in islam ,  women do not have to work ,  but if they want to work ,  the quran permits them to do so . 
the muftiat is asking the same question ,  since the spiritual directorate of muslims of kyrgyzstan and jumanov appoint the kazy . 
spiritual directorate sources say only a few stores in the countrys major cities have specialised islamic religious literature for sale ,  leaving those lacking access to consult the internet or preachers . 
the spiritual directorate has <num>800</num>  students enrolled in its islamic universitys two-year curriculum . 
however ,  one can become an imam by taking short-term courses . 
eight universities with islamic departments operate nationwide . 
the country also has the highest number of madrassas in the commonwealth of independent states- <num>54</num>  .
osmonaliyev said some lawmakers considered drafting a bill to make religion an academic subject . 
that plan ,  however ,  emphasised the history of religious thought ,  not religious views themselves . 
omurbek kulov ,  chairman of the council for religious affairs under the ombudsman of the kyrgyz republic ,  said his council was organized to address religious illiteracy among imams and kazy because the state commission on religious affairs lacks time and resources . 
the council consists of seven sunni muslims and two orthodox christians ,  all of whom are unpaid and each of whom already has a full-time career . 
we tried to do it on a democratic basis ,  kulov said . 
seventy-five percent of the  ( countrys )  residents are sunnis ,  and <num>20</num>  percent are orthodox christians . 
the panel will also address problems encountered by buddhists ,  catholics ,  and others ,  he said . 
kulov said the council will monitor relationships among different faith communities and provide religious education in order to prevent fanaticism . 
the council will also provide correct assessments and correct interpretations of the quran ,  kulov said . 
to provide this education and correct interpretations ,  the councils members will travel to the regions ,  where they will point out mistakes they find in the interpretation of scriptures to the heads of religious communities . 
kyrgyz found bakiyev too similar to akayev
with the freedom statue at right ,  smoke rises above the ala-too square april <num>7</num>  in bishkek ,  kyrgyzstan ,  where demonstrators turned out in large numbers . 
government vehicles were set on fire and fires were reported at the ministry of the interior building and the headquarters of the former kgb . 
 [ aynur asanova ] 
the surge of discontent that toppled kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev took years to form ,  and the consequences if the country becomes used to overthrowing its leaders have kyrgyz observers worried . 
bakiyev rose to power acclaimed as someone who would clean up the legacy of former president askar akayev . 
however ,  as the years passed ,  more and more kyrgyz began to complain they had exchanged one dictator for another . 
meanwhile ,  the imprisonment of political opponents and the blocking of opposition or alternative news sources raised fears of increasing repression and memories of akayevs last years in power . 
one of the most prominent of those defendants was former defence minister ismail isakov ,  who months after joining the opposition was charged with corruption and controversially sentenced to eight years of prison in january . 
one event and one process did nothing to help bakiyev retain power ,  according to eurasianet . 
russian mass media ,  which have wide readership and viewership in kyrgyzstan ,  began attacking him and his regime this spring . 
some fear that the kyrgyz may not receive the clean government they yearn for . 
eric mcglinchey ,  an assistant professor at george mason university outside washington dc ,  called the possibility of the people getting the corruption-free government theyre demanding very slight . 
people asked the same thing in <num>2005</num>  , but theres a lot of incentive to maintain what you have ,  and the system is set up to solidify power ,  he said . 
overthrows might be becoming a habit ,  temirkulov said . 
the thing that worries me is that this is the second time the law has been broken ,  the constitution has been violated "  ,  he said . 
 " the only possible way out of this situation is to put everybody at a single negotiating table ,  the opposition ,  the government ,  and the civil sector "  ,  he said . 
he faulted the government for allowing the situation to degenerate to this point by  " failing to give the people the truth about their country "  . 
 " from the very beginning of march ,  it was necessary to launch talks with the opposition . 
these talks more or less began but were suddenly cut off "  ,  he said . 
kazakpayev emphasised that with the fall of bakiyev ,  the new government's  " first priority must be to restore order "  . 
he urged any new government to avoid a vengeance-filled effort to distinguish  " those who backed bakiyev "  from  " those who didn't "  .

 [ guang niu / getty images ] 
in various statements and interviews ,  bakiyev laid blame for the chaos on the opposition ,  claimed that a coup detat had taken place ,  and said he planned to retake control of kyrgyzstan but refused to do so through violence . 
he later said he was ready to negotiate with the interim government . 
as president ,  i declare that i did not give up ,  and have not given up my powers ,  bakiyev said ,  asserting that he remained president and guarantor of the constitution in a statement distributed to news agencies . 
calling the seizure of power by the opposition unconstitutional ,  he placed all responsibility for the disorder in the country upon the interim government ,  but said he would accept responsibility for tragic events if an objective and unbiased investigation finds him responsible . 
bakiyev went on to urge all citizens to remain calm . 
but even as rumours swirled that a battalion was guarding bakiyev in his native dzhalal-abad oblast ,  he told radio ekho moskvy he would return only peacefully . 
bakiyev confirmed to ekho moskvy that he was in the south of kyrgyzstan ,  but refused to say exactly where . 
a central asia online correspondent in dzhalal-abad reported that bakiyev was staying with a relative in the village of markai . 
if the so-called temporary government ,  which appointed itself ,  is prepared to enter into negotiations ,  i am ready to hear it out right now ,  he told the bbc . 
bakiyevs refusal to resign or acknowledge that he has lost power poses a danger to the country ,  said azamat temirkulov ,  professor of political science at the american university of central asia . 
we have an informal division of the country into regions ,  and this could lead us to a more negative situation ,  temirkulov said . 
among the possibilities is a prolonged conflict that would lead to further chaos and more deaths as well as drive down the countrys faltering economy . 
others fear that the current situation could lead to a splintering of the country between north and south . 
bakiyev accused opposition leaders of carrying out a coup that led to unnecessary bloodshed . 
to the entire international community ,  the attempted coup detat is obvious . 
its price was the lives of our compatriots ,  he said in statement sent to reporters . 
opposition leaders rejected his assessment . 
bakiyev has completely discredited himself ,  said isa omurkulov ,  a social-democrat and former member of parliament . 
he has the blood of peaceful citizens on his conscience . 
he wont get any support anywhere . 
interim defence minister ismail isakov agreed . 
situation under control in kyrgyzstan ;  <num>2</num> -day mourning period declared

otumbayeva ,  appointed as leader of the temporary government ,  said she is expecting humanitarian aid from russia . 
 [ maksim slutskiy ] 
bishkek - calm has prevailed across kyrgyzstan as special forces  ( omon )  units ,  volunteer patrols and the interior ministry have restored order throughout the country after the april <num>7</num>  uprising . 
while the building housing the general prosecutors office has reportedly been set ablaze again ,  signs of looting have become practically invisible ,  according to central asia online correspondents from bishkek ,  osh ,  dzhalal-abad ,  talas and naryn . 
bishkek police said about <num>15,000</num>  people - including volunteer patrols ,  police officers and interior ministry forces - were patrolling the city . 
the patrols were sending home those who had poured into bishkek from out of town . 
kerimkulov was chair of the state agency for physical culture and sports under now-fugitive president kurmanbek bakiyev . 
we have <num>4,000</num>  members already ,  all of them volunteers ,  most of them athletes ,  kerimkulov said of spartak ,  the largest volunteer patrol group in bishkek . 
we patrol the streets and answer calls from residents . 
he said the patrols received more than <num>500</num>  calls april <num>8</num>  , but that the situation had calmed since then . 
right now the situation isnt bad . 
yesterday ,  when nasty situations came up ,  the police helped if we couldnt disperse the looters ,  he said . 
i think tonight will be pretty quiet . 
media organisations have asked the countrys main tv channels and mass media to stop broadcasting provocative announcements and images of looting . 
members of the special forces were working to defuse the explosives . 
i met with the people and called on them to honour their consciences and not give in to incitement by various destructive individuals at a time when we have fallen  ( compatriots )  to mourn ,  omurkulov said . 
authorities have been unable to gauge the extent of damage to property and the exact number of businesses damaged in the unrest ,  though it had been established that rioters damaged <num>27</num>  buses in bishkek . 
kindergartens ,  schools and other institutions are scheduled to reopen monday . 
madamin karatayev ,  deputy minister of health ,  said <num>76</num>  people died in the riots ,  and authorities have identified <num>66</num>  of them . 
during the disorders nationwide ,  <num>1,520</num>  people sought care at medical institutions ,  of whom <num>522</num>  were hospitalised ,  he said . 
forty-five of them went to intensive care . 
he added that the medical infrastructure had stabilised after a busy three days during the uprising . 
in the first half of the day ,  medicines were extremely scarce ,  because nobody ever expected this much demand . 
international organisations like the red cross and doctors without borders were extremely helpful ,  he said . 
kanybek imanaliyev ,  chairman of the organisational commission for burying those who died ,  gave details of the coming memorial services . 
we plan a collective memorial service sometime  ( saturday )  morning at the ata-beit complex in a suburb of bishkek . 
interim kyrgyz leader roza otumbayeva expressed her sympathies to victims of the violence ,  visited hospitals and said the interim government is seeking international aid . 
almaz atambayev ,  deputy prime minister of the temporary government ,  has gone to moscow to negotiate with russian prime minister vladimir putin . 
otumbayeva also continued to mould the new government ,  appointing new members to several strategic positions . 
former social-democratic party administrative secretary edil baisalov returned to the country and has been appointed to administrative director of the central executive committee . 
emil kaptagayev ,  leader of the uglu birimdik party and former deputy governor of the issyk-kul oblast ,  became director of the temporary governments administration . 
the temporary government also announced plans to pursue criminal charges against bakiyevs relatives ,  many of whom had been appointed to various government positions . 
the government has issued a wanted notice for bakiyevs brother ,  zhanysh ,  who had been chief of state security . 
he is thought to be hiding in the chui oblast . 
while bishkek appears to have stabilised ,  the situation remains tenuous in the regions ,  with reports varying from oblast to oblast . 
central asia online correspondents say chui oblast ,  naryn and talas are all stable and under control . 
police sources in osh told central asia online the situation has stabilised there ,  too . 
but omurkulov reported in a news conference that some residents of southern kyrgyzstan appeared to be planning a march on bishkek in order to start and wage a civil war . 
he asked the people of kyrgyzstan not to fall under provocations . 
in dzhalal-abad oblast ,  there was concern that some are attempting to create inter-ethnic tensions after someone fired a hunting rifle and lobbed an explosive device at the offices of the uzbek-language newspaper diidor in dzhalal-abad early april <num>9</num>  .
that same car had passed by several times in the few hours before the gunfire . 
nonetheless ,  he worried that the newspapers support of opposition leaders may have led bakiyev supporters to attack the newspaper in hopes of triggering an ethnic clash between kyrgyz and uzbeks . 
another minority ,  the small jewish community in bishkek ,  might be evacuated ,  according to mass media . 
some nationalistic and anti-semitic slogans had been heard on the street . 
the country has an estimated <num>1,500</num>  jews .

even as interim authorities in kyrgyzstan stripped bakiyev of his immunity to prosecution ,  several thousand people gathered to show their support in his southern stronghold . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
in accordance with the decree ,  the ex-president is subject to prosecution . 
the government plans to issue an arrest warrant soon . 
the government had been awaiting bakiyev's voluntary departure from office ,  beknazarov said . 
but since  " he has no intention of resigning ,  the temporary government was forced to take this step to preserve stability . 
if bakiyev doesn't surrender in two days ,  special forces will mount an operation to seize him "  ,  said beknarazov . 
the former president is rallying support in his home region in the south . 
on april <num>13</num>  , about <num>3,000</num>  of his supporters convened in dzhalal-abad . 
meanwhile ,  in teiit ,  bakiyev's native village near dzhalal-abad ,  his brother and former chief of bodyguards zhanybek bakiyev held a news conference . 
he told reporters that troops in three armoured personnel carriers had left osh and were heading for dzhalal-abad . 
the troops' precise destination is unknown ,  but zhanybek bakiyev said the troops could be coming to arrest the deposed president . 
on april <num>12</num>  , kurmanbek bakiyev held a news conference of his own in teiit . 
he said that he was  " ready to give up his powers ,  if armed men stop stalking the streets ,  the violence and seizures of property end ,  and order is restored "  . 
he also requested guarantees of safety for himself and those close to him ,  a central asia online correspondent reported . 
surrounding the former president were <num>12</num>  men with automatic weapons and several others with pistols and hunting rifles ,  according to a central asia online correspondent . 
bakiyev also said he had no objections to the formation of a parliamentary republic in kyrgyzstan . 
an international commission needs to resolve the question of his resignation ,  he said . 
he said he was ready to negotiate but that he saw  " no desire from the opposite side "  . 
 " let the temporary government get onto a plane and fly here to negotiate "  ,  he said . 
 " i guarantee its members' safety "  . 
in bishkek ,  the interim government replaced all of the former president's leading appointees . 
the government on april <num>13</num>  also dissolved the constitutional court because  " it didn't meet the hopes invested in it but instead made possible the consolidation of bakiyev and  ( predecessor askar )  akayev's corrupt rule "  ,  beknazarov told central asia online . 
 " for three years the constitutional court issued rulings allowing  ( them to )  usurp power "  . 
the court replied that it would not dispute the rulings of the temporary government in the name of stability and avoidance of conflict between political forces . 
international envoys are calling for stabilisation . 
jan kubis ,  special envoy of un secretary-general ban ki-moon ,  meet with ombudsman tursunbek akun . 
the ombudsman told central asia online that he told kubis ,   " bakiyev's fatal mistake was arresting opposition leaders . 
the temporary government will be in the driver's seat if it consults different elements of society in appointing officials "  . 
 " the osce believes that the first priority must be to guarantee safety and to establish a business environment and legal system "  . 
the situation is stabilising in bishkek ,  said tariel iskanov ,  chief of staff of the patriot volunteer patrol ,  at an april <num>13</num>  news conference . 
 " in general they concern seizures of land and businesses "  . 
law enforcement has recorded more than <num>100</num>  business seizures ,  he said . 
he attributed them to  " akayev people who lost property to bakiyev people earlier . 
now they're trying to take it back "  . 
the general prosecutor already has returned <num>15</num>  properties to their legal owners . 
battles for power are still unfolding in some kyrgyz cities . 
 " karakol is in chaos "  ,  valentina galich ,  director of the chintamani human rights organisation in dzhalal-abad oblast ,  told central asia online . 
 " a former policeman occupies the mayor's chair there ,  and he clearly doesn't want to give it up to someone with more experience and education .

bishkek -- two weeks after the opposition toppled the government of kurmanbek bakiyev ,  it continues to struggle as looting ,  protests ,  and challenges to its authority continue across the country . 
here is a synopsis of what the country dealt with april <num>20</num>  : 
 *  looters in bishkek stormed the dordoi wholesale market ,  according to russian media . 
reports of the losses varied . 
a central asia online correspondent heard a representative of the market's trade union say that merchants locked up their belongings as soon as they heard of the approaching mob . 
 *  about <num>10,000</num>  volunteers are helping to patrol bishkek streets ,  patriot patrol spokesman daniyar terbishaliyev told a central asia online correspondent . 
the interior ministry has sent police to hot spots like mayevka ,  where rioting killed five a day earlier . 
 *  an independent commission investigating the causes of the april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  unrest released its preliminary report to the government . 
the panel includes noted human rights activists and journalists . 
the panel is calling for the interim government to reconvene the disbanded parliament - even though <num>70</num>  %  of its members belonged to bakiyev's ak-zhol party - so that it can make interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva acting president or prime minister . 
the parliament should also affirm the composition of the interim government and set dates for presidential and parliamentary elections before disbanding itself ,  the commission said . 
 *  kazakhstani foreign minister kanat saudabayev credited the osce with preventing civil war at a news conference in bishkek . 
he said the osce helped bakiyev leave the country so that a dual-power situation never arose . 
saudabayev is visiting bishkek in his capacity as osce chairman . 
 *  interim oblast governor bektur asanov ,  still blocked by demonstrators from using his own office ,  is performing his duties from oblast police headquarters . 
 *  someone in a car passing by dzhalal-abad oblast police headquarters on the night of april <num>19</num>  fired into the air . 
authorities reported no injuries in the incident . 
 *  the interim government fired talas mayor erkin tursunkulov and named seren sheishenov acting mayor . 
 *  as for bakiyev ,  he was reported to have arrived in minsk ,  belarus . 
belarussian president alexandr lukashenko announced to parliament that bakiyev was in the country and that he would have the protection of the government . 
kyrgyzstans land crisis comes to a head - again
a sign on a tent proclaims the area a peoples settlement in bishkek ,  april <num>21</num>  .
faced with a lack of land ,  housing and jobs in the countryside ,  people are occupying empty plots of land and calling on the government to recognise their settlements . 
bishkek -- much like the <num>2005</num>  tulip revolution ,  the <num>2010</num>  toppling of the kyrgyz government has exposed a raft of fundamental problems :  a lack of housing ,  land ,  economic opportunity and corruption . 
but while ,  in <num>2005</num>  , people seized land in bishkek and other cities to at least have a place to call home ,  this time around the situation is different . 
five years ago ,  the governments decision to legalise seized plots was forced ,  and more of a political measure - it was necessary to relieve the tension associated with the escalation of the housing crisis ,  said aida duishenbiyeva ,  attorney for the state department for architecture and construction supervision . 
now ,  the situation is different :  the housing problem is not resolved ,  but there are no vacant lots remaining around  ( bishkek )  and the city is not ready for new expansion . 
when the uprising of april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  toppled the government of president kurmabek bakiyev ,  the land disputes that raged five years ago again flared . 
after the tulip revolution ,  the government promised to legalise lands the squatters had seized around the capital . 
however ,  experts say that due to the systems corruption ,  all the good lots went to the rich ,  while the poor had to huddle in garbage dumps and cemeteries . 
gulnara abazbekova ,  head of the department for protection of social ,  economic and cultural rights ,  said disputes over land and housing are rooted in an increase in internal migration from the villages to cities . 
in the past <num>15</num>  years ,  one-third of the population has moved ,  most to areas around bishkek and osh . 
with no job opportunities in the countryside ,  and nowhere to live in the city ,  migrants try either to take land belonging to residents of the capital or seize vacant lots . 
that desire for land and housing has led some to call for the ouster of russians and turkic residents ,  and led to the deaths of five people and the wounding of dozens more in clashes april <num>19</num>  .
kalicha umuraliyeva ,  a un human rights housing consultant ,  said the authorities inaction in addressing housing issues since independence in the <num>1990</num>  second  has created the housing crisis . 
currently ,  various sources say more than <num>200,000</num>  families are in need of housing . 
umuraliyeva said the problem is that after the collapse of the ussr ,  kyrgyzstan privatised not only the state housing fund ,  but also land . 
high corruption ,  inequitable allocation of land and lack of legislation aimed at regulating the maximum area of lots of land have led to the marginalisation of the indigent strata of the population . 
during the tulip revolution ,  the issue came up again . 
the authorities who came to power issued a decree on the allocation of plots of land for the construction of both individual and multi-unit housing projects . 
they promised to legalised seized lands and develop communications and other infrastructure . 
the authorities even had to convert agricultural lands . 
people filled the mayors office ,  which made decisions about land allocation . 
a number of officials in league with the leaders of the landless collected money from people in exchange for assistance in obtaining lots and for decisions to convert agricultural lands in their favour . 
as a result of these scams ,  thousands of homeless and landless people were never able to receive the prized lots ,  and the shady officials and their partners lined their pockets ,  said abazbekova . 
umuraliyeva said another problem has been the low rate at which low-income public housing has been built . 
whereas <num>22,400</num>  apartments were built in <num>1990</num>  , it was only <num>5,200</num>  in <num>2005</num>  and <num>5,400</num>  in <num>2006</num>  , she said . 
but many who squatted on land in <num>2005</num>  are still unhappy - and are still looking for land to call their own . 
the rich receive the land ,  and the poor population only becomes poorer . 
… the main cause for this situation is corruption in land allocation . 
umuraliyeva said plots in the northern part of bishkek given the poor are located near landfills and cattle burial sites . 
because of environmental hazards and the potential for flooding ,  much of the land given out in <num>2005</num>  has never been legally registered . 
an official of the bishkek mayors office ,  who requested anonymity ,  told central asia online that the interim government is hesitant to repeat the actions of <num>2005</num>  .
especially ,  if those actions could lead to deaths . 
 [ a ] fter <num>2005</num>  , a decree was issued on the extradition of land for housing . 
then when they realised that a number of the plots were dangerous for people ,  the decree was done away with . 
but people managed to hastily build mud houses ,  the official said . 
any sort of mudslide could wash out the ground and expose dangerous buried waste . 
moreover ,  gas pipelines run through these districts ,  which ,  in case of an accident ,  can take peoples lives . 
…tens of thousands of people are living in these new housing sites ,  and no one intends to move out . 
duishenbiyeva believes that without the construction of middle-class apartment buildings ,  economic support for the regions to create jobs and alleviate migration to the cities ,  and the clear application of the law ,  housing and land issues will continue . 
time will tell if the new government will be able to raise funding for the construction of public housing and develop a clear ,  realistic programme to support villages ,  she said . 
constitutional changes would turn kyrgyzstan into parliamentary republic
the interim governments leader on constitutional reform is deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev ,  shown here at a peoples kurultai march <num>17</num>  .
bishkek -- the outlines of a new government are taking shape after kyrgyzstan ousted its second president in five years . 
a first-draft of the new constitution is to be issued april <num>25</num>  , followed by consultations with the public and civil society until may <num>19</num>  .
a national referendum to accept or reject the constitution is scheduled for june <num>27</num>  .
were fundamentally reviewing three centres of power ,  said interim deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev ,  who is leading the constitutional reform effort . 
namely ,  presidential ,  parliamentary and cabinet powers . 
but ,  the new edition of the constitution wont be an absolutely new document . 
having three power centres would effectively make kyrgyzstan the first parliamentary republic in central asia ,  he said . 
nurlan sadykov ,  director of the institute of constitutional policy and a member of the group that will use tekebayevs working document to draft a new constitution ,  said the system is needed to avoid any one person from consolidating power . 
kyrgyzstan has to abandon a system in which one person decided everything ,  he said . 
a parliamentary republic is precisely such a system . 
the zhogorku kenesh  ( parliament )  will gain power ;  its role will grow significantly . 
the parliament will be effectively running the country . 
the parliament ,  elected by a proportional voting system ,  would name government officials ,  as done in western parliamentary democracies . 
the will be safeguards so that the ruling party cannot run roughshod in parliament ,  sadykov said . 
giving several key committees to the opposition will be a very important check on  ( the ruling partys )  power ,  sadykov said . 
at this time ,  we can say that theyll include the committees on economics and security and ,  at a minimum ,  one vice-speakership . 
if some insurmountable problems arise between the government and parliament…the president can dissolve the zhogorku kenesh and call new elections . 
in tekebayevs envisioned constitution ,  the head of state will sign laws approved by parliament and approve the nominations of ministers and judges . 
but the president will not be able to veto or refuse to sign a law passed by parliament ,  kazakpayev said . 
the president would be able ,  for example ,  to fire any minister after reaching agreement with the prime minister . 
the same applies to judges ,  and thats not a bad idea ,  kazakpayev continued . 
the president used to name them . 
now the national council for judicial affairs will name them . 
even in the preceding government ,  the council made a good case for itself as a relatively neutral and fair agency . 
marat kazakpayev ,  a political scientist at the kyrgyz-russian slavic university ,  said the head of state needs to lead the nation ,  even in a parliamentary republic . 
the interim government has a certain lack of understanding of a parliamentary republic ,  he said . 
all the same ,  having the parliament elect the president is an important characteristic of the parliamentary form of government . 
but comparing the head of state and symbol of the nation to a notary public is humiliating ,  i think . 
removing the head of states immunity is a tough question ,  one experts have yet to agree on . 
kyrgyz communist party chief iskhak masaliyev has chaired the parliamentary committee on constitutional legislation the past ten years . 
tekebayevs proposed constitution deserves consideration for at least putting forth genuinely democratic values ,  he said . 
were going to have seven or eight presidents instead of one :  the speaker ,  leaders of major parliamentary factions ,  and the prime minister ,  even though  ( his or her )  powers havent been defined yet . 
representatives of civil society are not yet preoccupied with constitutional reform . 
theres still a month of work ahead ,  said toktaiym umetaliyeva ,  leader of the country's association of nonprofits and ngos . 
 " we'll most certainly be making suggestions . 
right now i can only be glad that the interim government is finally tackling the question of legitimising its authority and is taking certain steps to conduct an honest referendum and honest elections "  . 
umetaliyeva listed the formation of a central election and referendum commission as one of those steps . 
 " they've already said that opposition parties and the civil sector will  ( be part of that commission )  "  ,  she said . 
 " but that'll happen after the elections "  . 
the working group ,  also known as the constitutional convention ,  has <num>30</num>  members . 
besides officials from the interim government ,  they include judges ,  interpreters and representatives of civil society . 
law enforcement agencies in southern kyrgyzstan show off seized weapons along with leaflets and audiocassettes calling for the creation of a caliphate . 
 [ erkin kamalov ] 
osh -- muslims in southern kyrgyzstan enthusiastically welcomed a recent promise from the interim government to release <num>32</num>  people from prison . 
during a speech on national television ,  interim kyrgyz vice president almazbek atambayev said that those convicted in relation to the nookat events will receive amnesty and go free on may <num>9</num>  .
the muslims from nookat region who were found guilty of organising mass riots on october <num>1</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , during celebrations of the muslim holiday orozo-ait  ( eid al-fitr )  were unjustly convicted ,  atambayev said during a tv appearance april <num>29</num>  , in response to questions submitted by viewers . 
we greeted this message with joy because among those wrongfully convicted are a few who sympathise with us ,  said dilmurat ,  a self-acknowledged member of hizb ut-tahrir ,  a party banned in kyrgyzstan . 
a year and a half ago ,  the former authorities deliberately provoked the conflict ,  which provided an excuse for the arrest of faithful muslims who had no relationship to religious extremists or hizb ut-tahrir party ,  said mamasali . 
the lawyers of the soon-to-be-freed inmates share that opinion . 
the charges stemmed solely from assumptions and guesswork ,  they said . 
appearing in the court dock were those who simply appeared in the camera lens ,  which provided the grounds to incriminate them in the wrongdoing ,  lawyer nazgul suyunbayeva told central asia online . 
there is not a single piece of evidence that they threw even one stone at the nookat district government building or were shouting anti-constitutional slogans . 
the nookat events demonstrate how easily the government can initiate criminal proceedings against any muslim ,  osh human rights activist aliima sharipova said . 
at the time ,  <num>32</num>  people were convicted for the nookat events ,  said sharipova . 
after  ( the trial )  ,  faithful muslims were forced to sit at home for fear that the special services would try to detain them under various pretexts and invent charges against them . 
mirzolim-hoja said his brother went to prison on trumped-up charges . 
but police say they arent backing down ,  even with the release of the nookat <num>32</num>  .
we continue to suppress the activities of non-traditional schools of islam ,  said zamir sadykov ,  press secretary for the osh city department of internal affairs . 
in case of incitement of religious hatred ,  we have to <abbr>…</abbr>  prosecute according to article <num>299</num>  of the criminal code of kyrgyzstan . 
article <num>299</num>  bans inciting hostility based on nationality ,  religion or race . 
they promote building a caliphate based on sharia law in central asian countries ,  which causes concern . 
we have found not only leaflets but weapons too on some members of hizb ut-tahrir . 
law enforcement is still monitoring extremist organisations that have gone underground ,  the officer said ,  despite the recent political turmoil . 
the country is seeing a growth of radical and politicised movements that do not conform to traditional religious doctrine ,  said kanybek osmonaliev ,  director of the kyrgyz committee for religious affairs . 
he blamed that growth on foreign proselytisers . 
these include the banned party hizb ut-tahrir ,  the followers of the salafist movement ,  the underground work of the akramiya group ,  islamic movement of turkestan and a number of others ,  he said . 
whether in kyrgyzstan or other countries in central asia ,  pitting the desires of muslims against the states and societys interests and laying the groundwork for forming a caliphate enter into their plans . 
some call for dividing kyrgyzstan into halves
supporters of ousted kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev rally in osh ,  april <num>15</num>  .
bakiyev supporters and others in the south are seeking to divide the country into northern and southern halves . 
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
bishkek -- leaflets calling for a division of kyrgyzstan into northern and southern portions are circulating in the south . 
the two halves would share an army ,  a ministry of emergency situations ,  a currency ,  human rights protection and border security . 
a group calling itself the peoples opposition front to the interim government ,  led by human rights activist tolon dyikanbaev ,  is behind the effort . 
leaflets with cds were left in markets and crowded places ,  and passersby eagerly took them ,  an osh resident named bakyt said . 
the cds included recorded speeches by former president kurmanbek bakiyev ,  in which he blames the interim government for the deaths during the april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  unrest and for the subsequent instability . 
southern kyrgyzstan has a larger population and has much of the countrys electrical-generating capacity . 
interim deputy chairman almazbek atambayev said in a state television broadcast the government will not allow a division of the country . 
such talk <abbr>…</abbr>  comes from foreign experts interested in destabilising <abbr>…</abbr>  the country ,  almaz kalet ,  director of tamga-news ,  said . 
the idea of dividing the country has a long history . 
the second president ,  bakiyev ,  came from the south and lost his job to unrest that began in the north . 
the beating of former interior minister moldomusa kongantiyev in the northern city of talas exacerbated southerners resentment . 
southerners have thought that they drove out our guys . 
the interim government must take into account the regional dimension when allocating positions ,  said osh resident aibek hamidov . 
the allocation of the top six slots in the interim government to three northerners and three southerners has not allayed such suspicions . 
the problems in mayevka that led to the destruction of ethnic turks and russians houses ,  the seizure of land in bishkek and the ongoing demands in mailuu-sai for kongantiyevs release from detention all demonstrate the need to declare a state of emergency and a temporary moratorium on public activities ,  kalet said . 
division of the north and south is not realistic ,  but small conflicts can easily destabilise the situation throughout the country . 
splitting the country into north and south is possible if appropriate measures are not taken ,  kasabolotov warned . 
we need to put to a referendum the issue of punishing akayevs and bakiyevs regimes and also an item stating that members of their parties ,  alga kyrgyzstan and ak-zhol ,  cannot run for president or parliament ,  he said . 
such a move will weaken the former leaders supporters ,  who left unchecked could destabilise the country ,  he said . 
yes ,  there are differences in dialect ,  minor customs ,  clothes and so on ,  kalet said . 
however ,  there are no fundamental differences . 
we are one people ,  one language ,  one culture . 
in general ,  this idea is unattainable . 
only at gunpoint is it possible to force us to divide . 
kazakhs believe in traditional healers more than doctors
a man touches his forehead to a stele as part of a traditional kazkah healing ritual at uigentas ,  <num>85</num>  km east of almaty . 
bifatima dauletova ,  a baksy or shaman ,  believes the stele marks the centre of the earth . 
 [ timur batyrshin ] 
almaty - when doctors are powerless ,  people go to healers . 
according to some patients ,  healing with prayers and herbs is highly successful . 
the ministry of health does not recognise traditional healers ,  but many doctors send patients to healers unofficially . 
when our son was born ,  i was very proud . 
he is ,  after all ,  our familys successor . 
i named our son zhanabil  ( spirit of the father )  ,  said azamat . 
when he was <num>18</num>  months old ,  we were not that worried ,  but then he hit <num>2</num>  and he did not talk at all ,  only making all sorts of sounds similar to bellowing ,  said azamat . 
the paediatrician said that our boy was absolutely normal ,  but did not find the reason why he was not talking . 
the family took zhanabil to a speech therapist ,  but to no avail . 
i was already completely in despair when the neighbours suggested taking our son to the healer ,  said the father . 
azamats son is now almost <num>3</num>  and has begun to speak . 
my wife says that our son would have started speaking even without the shamans ,  but i believe that they ,  the healers ,  helped him ,  said azamat . 
chairman of the association of the professional traditional healers of kazakhstan zyadan kozhalymov said there are more than <num>5,000</num>  members in his association . 
operating within the framework of the association are educational centres ,  a research council and the committee on the organisation of professional training of traditional healers . 
the association also publishes journals and books . 
the association of traditional healers of kazakhstan is an independent public union that performs its activities on the principles of voluntarism ,  democratic principles and also compassion ,  unselfishness ,  a caring attitude towards nature and an education of high spirituality ,  kozhalymov said . 
there ,  healers practise . 
they turn to the spirits of their ancestors ,  the five shapyrashty forefathers who grandfathered the kazakhs of almaty . 
among others ,  president nursultan nazarbayev is one of their descendants . 
it does not trouble the healers that one of the shapyrashty grandfathers was poet zhambyl zhabayev ,  a communist and admirer of joseph stalin . 
according to one of the healers at bes ata ,  the healing consists of group prayers in kazakh ,  with questions on the theme at hand being answered in rhyme . 
if the patient suddenly starts improvising ,  it means that the spirit has descended upon him . 
dauletova said she heals through prayer and calling to the spirits . 
healing can only come from god . 
marina ,  from astana ,  said she visits healers and that she stopped believing in doctors long ago . 
i suffered from severe angina and there was no way i could be cured . 
the doctors did not help . 
another visitor of shamans ,  wishing to remain anonymous ,  said that not even nazarbayev believes in doctors . 
on march <num>5</num>  , nazarbayev noted the importance of health reform at a meeting in honour of international womens day . 
our doctors level is below that of austrian nurses ,  said the president . 
the ministry of health considers alternative medicine questionable . 
on the condition of anonymity ,  a surgeon from almatys 12t clinical hospital said ,  when it comes to health ,  you do not think about what is traditional and what is not ;  you simply look for how to get better . 
if you want grandmothers to cure you ,  may god help you . 
the surgeon also noted that traditional healers services cost less . 
in <num>2004</num>  , kazakhstan hosted the first congress on traditional healing in central asia . 
more than <num>500</num>  delegates from central asia ,  russia and india attended . 
kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan also have associations of traditional healers . 
russian export duties on oil ,  cutoff of deliveries cause hardship in kyrgyzstan
bishkek - kyrgyz customers have struggled with high energy prices since russia introduced customs duties on its hydrocarbon exports april <num>1</num>  .
kazakhstan has stepped up as an alternative vendor and is delivering <num>3,700</num>  tonnes of diesel as humanitarian aid for farmers . 
but motorists ,  farmers and other oil users have had to alter their lives nonetheless . 
in early april ,  russia introduced customs duties of us <num>193.50</num>  $  per tonne on gasoline and diesel fuel exports to kyrgyzstan . 
russias lukoil ,  russneft ,  gazprom neft and tnk-bp have stopped shipping oil until the situation clears up . 
the interim government attempted to negotiate ,  but russia ,  justifying its decision under the russian-belarusian-kazakhstani customs unions single tariff ,  held its position . 
bazarbai mambetov ,  president of the oil traders association ,  said russia is violating an agreement not to impose duties on light oil products meant for kyrgyz domestic use . 
meanwhile ,  tajikistan - which ,  like kyrgyzstan ,  does not belong to the customs union - is not paying duties on russian oil ,  political analyst mars sariyev said . 
russia doubts that kyrgyzstan is importing the oil for domestic use only ,  pavel dyatlenko ,  an analyst at polis asia ,  said . 
dyatlenko did not rule out the possibility that kyrgyzstan is reselling it . 
then-president kurmanbek bakiyevs government intended to try and negotiate with russia ,  but his overthrow in early april pushed the issue into the background . 
now the problem is again acute . 
such duties will become a burden ,  ministry of economic regulation spokesman azamat tynayev said . 
this will lead to a chain increase in prices of other goods and services ,  he said . 
cancellation of duties will allow bishkek to save <num>193.50</num>  $  per year ,  said andrei grozin ,  chairman of the department of central asia and kazakhstan studies at the moscow-based institute of cis countries . 
kyrgyzstan is importing petroleum products from kazakhstan ,  but at a higher price ,  and can buy only one days supply at a time ,  mambetov said . 
suppliers are taking into account that russia has imposed customs duties and are also factoring in risks ,  taking into account the instability in  ( kyrgyzstan )  . 
interim government deputy chairman almazbek atambayev has been to moscow twice for talks ,  but to no avail . 
acting finance minister temir sariyev also tried ,  but it is difficult to say when an agreement will be reached ,  tynayev said . 
if kyrgyzstan entered the customs union ,  the tariffs would be cancelled ,  dyatlenko suggested . 
there will be a unified economic zone without customs barriers . 
… moreover ,  russia is interested in expanding its market . 
tynayev considers entry into the customs union a difficult issue ,  which requires careful consideration . 
a cutoff by russia hamstrings kyrgyzstan . 
its only oil suppliers in normal times are russia  ( <num>70</num>  %  )  and kazakhstan  ( <num>30</num>  %  )  ,  tynayev said . 
importing from elsewhere is logistically impossible . 
nurdin ,  <num>27</num>  , a car owner ,  works as a credit specialist in bishkek . 
every day ,  he commutes from belovodsk ,  <num>40</num>  minutes away . 
to cover his gasoline costs ,  he usually gives clients a lift . 
every day on the road ,  i pump ten litres of gasoline for a round trip ,  nurdin said . 
and as a result ,  i almost pay my way . 
but ,  if the price keeps rising ,  i will most likely start taking a shuttle bus  ( marshrutka )  or a taxi instead of my own car . 
the shortage of diesel fuel is hampering planting ,  said kurmanbek ,  <num>60</num>  , a farmer from toktogul region . 
now ,  all hope rests on the authorities solving the problem and providing diesel ;  otherwise ,  the fields will just go unploughed ,  he said . 
an official from chui oblast for the state committee on environmental protection said he and his colleagues have been performing fewer inspections . 
… now ,   <abbr>…</abbr>  we can act only in cases of major violations ,  he said . 
the situation has not changed in over a month . 
sariyev is calling the situation an economic blockade . 
russia is using such measures to put pressure on kyrgyzstan ,  he concluded . 
kyrgyz-kazakhstani border remains closed
bishkek - after waiting for more than a month ,  only a small number of those waiting on the kyrgyz side of the border successfully crossed into kazakhstan may <num>11</num>  .
despite announcements to the contrary ,  the border remained closed . 
last week the interim kyrgyz government announced it had reached agreement with astana ,  and the border would reopen at 6 . 30a may <num>11</num>  .
but despite kygyz pronouncements ,  kazakhstan said it was not yet ready to reopen the border . 
the question of reopening the border is still under review . 
in kazakhstan ,  everybodys interested in a further improvement of the situation in our neighbouring country . 
kazakhstan closed its borders with kyrgyzstan april <num>7</num>  during the uprising that ousted kurmanbek bakiyev . 
since then ,  kazakhstan has permited only limited cross-border traffic . 
by 7am ,  an eager crowd had gathered at the kordai checkpoint ,  hoping to enter kazakhstan . 
mariiam bekesheva lives in the kyrgyz village of leninskoye but works in the kazakhstani village of kordai . 
or she would ,  if the border re-opened . 
im a teacher ,  she said . 
ive been unemployed for a month because they  ( kazakhstani authorities )  wouldnt let me cross . 
they said that they'd let people over at 6 . 30am . 
i was thinking that i could start teaching math again . 
but they're still not letting anyone over "  . 
maksat muibillayev delivers groceries to kazakhstani stores . 
the border guards refused to talk to the waiting kyrgyz crowd . 
one kyrgyz border guard who refused to identify himself said that an order to open the border had gone out ,  but only to local border guards . 
 " our kazakhstani colleagues say that they've not received an order  ( to re-open the border )  "  ,  he said . 
 " you want to know if they've blocked the road on their side ? 
i have no way of knowing . 
yes ,  but only international surface shipments "  . 
at 11a ,  kyrgyz border guards allowed a group bearing kyrgyz passports to reach the checkpoint . 
it was the first and last such group . 
but an employee of the border guard's media department said the border had not re-opened . 
 " the border didn't open today "  ,  he said . 
 " no groups crossed it . 
who's keeping it closed ? 
kazakhstan "  . 
having waited several hours at the kordai checkpoint ,  disappointed kyrgyz returned to bishkek . 
ainura ,  who makes a living delivering potatoes to kazakhstan ,  wants to hear from the interim government . 
but economist zhumankadyr akeneyev said kazakhstan is guilty .

 [ abdulhadi hairan ] 
kabul - a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden minivan into a military convoy in eastern kabul may <num>18</num>  , killing at least <num>20</num>  people - mostly civilians - and wounding more than <num>40</num>  others . 
the powerful explosion took place near the new afghan parliament building ,  opposite an afghan national army recruitment centre ,  on the busy darul aman road . 
officials at the scene said the minivan ,  filled with several hundred kilogrammes of explosives ,  struck an international convoy ,  but at least <num>12</num>  of the casualties were afghan civilians because it was morning rush hour . 
a press release from afghanistans interior ministry confirmed it was a suicide attack carried out by  " enemies of afghanistan and islam "  . 
the ministry promised an investigation to find out how the bomber entered the city with so many explosives . 
eyewitnesses said that immediately after the strike ,  a helicopter evacuated the wounded while heavy contingents of afghan and international soldiers secured the area . 
hospital officials confirmed at least <num>10</num>  dead afghans and about <num>40</num>  injured . 
an international coalition official at the scene ,  who did not want to be identified because he lacked authorisation to talk to the media ,  confirmed that five american troops were killed ,  with at least five more injured . 
though afghan and coalition officials did not provide any details ,  a taliban spokesman ,  zabiullah mujahid ,  calling from an undisclosed location ,  claimed responsibility and identified the bomber as hussamuddin ,  from ghazni province in afghanistan . 
the bombing came just before an important press conference by president hamid karzai . 
analysts in kabul say attacks such as this may harm afghan efforts to begin talks with insurgents . 
trucks cross the kyrgyz-kazakh border at ak-zhol after kazakhstan reopened the border may <num>20</num>  .
bishkek -- kazakhstan reopened its border with kyrgyzstan may <num>20</num>  , <num>42</num>  days after sealing it because of the populist uprising against kurmanbek bakiyevs government . 
the reopening came after numerous pleas from citizens of both countries and a rise in food prices in southern kazakhstan . 
the order to reopen the frontier came the night before ,  a kazakhstani border guard said ,  speaking on condition of anonymity . 
the kazakhstani foreign ministry issued a statement ,  saying taking into account the difficult socio-economic situation in kyrgyzstan and the numerous appeals from citizens of a country friendly to us ,  kazakhstani president nursultan nazarbayev gave the order <abbr>…</abbr>  to lift the temporary restrictions  ( on the border )  . 
all checkpoints are working normally . 
kyrgyz citizens have to show only their internal passport . 
nobody has calculated the economic damage to kyrgyzstan . 
association of markets chairman sergei ponomarev says it amounts to billions of soms . 
southern kazakhstan suffered from the closed borders ,  too . 
roza nazarbekova ,  the deputy director of the oblast administration for industry and business ,  said that prices on some groceries rose <num>50</num>  %  . 
in the last week the price for a kilo of strawberries went up from <num>200</num>  to <num>320</num> -<num>350</num>  kzt  ( us <num>1.36</num>  $  to <num>2.17</num>  $ -<num>2.37</num>  )  ,  she said . 
meat prices ,  including sausage ,  went up . 
we imported many such goods from kyrgyzstan . 
inflation in grocery prices after the border shutdown was noted too in zhambyl oblast . 
prices went up considerably for cream ,  beans ,  apples and potatoes . 
anara saulemova ,  an almaty entrepreneur ,  waited more than a month for the chance to visit dordoi ,  central asias largest wholesale market . 
 " dordoi has cheap merchandise "  ,  she said . 
 " half of kazakhstan wears clothes from dordoi ;  goods from dordoi are exported to russia too . 
we are going to buy up everything just in case the border closes again "  . 
to some ,  it appeared that kazakhstani authorities were not allowing vehicles with cargo to cross the border . 
but a kazakhstani border guard said that was not the case . 
 " we're inspecting every load more thoroughly . 
this creates the impression that we're not allowing anything through "  . 
kyrgyz border guards are expecting a frenzy may <num>21</num>  , when information about the border reopening spreads . 
in additional news ,  kyrgyz authorities resumed deliveries of talas river irrigation water to zhambyl oblast in kazakhstan two hours after the border reopening . 
they had cut off the water may <num>19</num>  .
kyrgyz officials would not comment on the matter . 
human rights watch is an independent ,  nongovernmental organisation ,  supported by contributions from private individuals and foundations worldwide . 
it accepts no government funds ,  directly or indirectly
the uzbek authorities have banned a representative of human rights watch  ( hrw )  ,  igor vorontsov ,  from returning to uzbekistan . 
until recently the authorities of this central asian republic ,  which was at one time part of the former soviet union ,  have never been so severe with hrw even though they did not approve of its activities on the countrys territory . 
hrw ceased its work in uzbekistan in june <num>2007</num>  , when the director of its office ,  andrea berg ,  was deprived of her accreditation . 
ferghana . 
ru reports that the uzbek authorities refused him accreditation on the grounds that he is unfamiliar with the mentality of the uzbek people and incapable of evaluating the reforms carried out by the countrys leadership . 
the response of the uzbekistan ministry of justice to hrw ,  was dated may <num>8</num>  - a week after the extension of european sanctions against uzbekistan for the bloody events in andizhan city in <num>2005</num>  .
at that time ,  dozens of people were killed when the authorities subdued a peaceful protest meeting . 
in that same year ,  the european union introduced sanctions on weapons sales ,  and also froze the treaty on cooperation with this central asian republic . 
the eu explained its decision by citing the fact that the uzbek authorities hampered an independent international investigation of the tragic events in andizhan . 
the unilateral eu decision to freeze the treaty on partnership and cooperation with the other party was the first such decision in the entire history of the organisation . 
the sanctions have now been somewhat relaxed but have still been extended for six months . 
uznews . 
net reports :  this international organisation that defends rights is being helped by the eu ,  the governments of several european countries ,  and the united states ,  whose representatives are reminding the uzbek authorities of the need to provide accreditation for hrw . 
at the beginning of july ,  the executive director of hrw ,  kenneth roth ,  visited uzbekistan . 
he met some uzbek officials ,  trying to convince them that vorontsov should be accredited and given the opportunity to work as the hrw representative in uzbekistan . 
ferghana . 
ru reported :  the expulsion of vorontsov from the country hardly speaks of any success in the hrw negotiations with the uzbek authorities ,  or the readiness of the latter to improve the situation with respect to human rights ,  or to react with tolerance to the presence of this influential organisation that defends human rights . 
it is reported in an hrw press release that by refusing accreditation for vorontsov the uzbek authorities have announced that they will notwithstanding consider other candidates for the post of head of the hrw office in uzbekistan . 
however ,  with one significant condition ,  namely that the candidates not be russian . 
the human rights defenders from this international organisation believe that the matter does not touch vorontsov personally but is an attempt by the uzbek authorities to bring hrw activity in uzbekistan to an end . 
following in its tradition of independence from the authorities ,  hrw has announced that it will ,  working from inside or outside the country ,  continue its activities seeking out instances of human rights violations in uzbekistan .

fazlullah reportedly was killed in eastern afghanistan may <num>26</num>  fighting against afghan troops . 
 [ aamir qureshi / afp / getty images ] 
mohammad zaman mamoozai ,  commander of border police in the eastern zone of afghanistan ,  told central asia online the pakistani militant leader died in a shootout with afghan police in the barg-e-matal district . 
he did not reveal more details ,  other than confirming that one police officer was also among the dead in recent fighting . 
only two days ago ,  nuristan gov jamaluddin badr told reporters in jalalabad that <num>300</num>  militants led by fazlullah had attacked the afghan province . 
last years military operation in swat drove out fazlullah and his fighters . 
news reports suggested that he was hiding in eastern afghanistan . 
some pakistani reporters confirmed that he called them from an afghan cell number . 
the current report of fazlullahs death is not the first ,  and there have been numerous erroneous reports of the deaths of other militant leaders . 
on may <num>28</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , there were reports that fazlullah had been killed . 
on july <num>10</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , news media reported that fazlullah had been critically wounded and was near death . 
kyrgyz-uzbek border situation tense
the dispute has pitted residents of the uzbek villages of khushiar and rishtan ,  and the uzbek enclave of sokh within the kyrgyz oblast of batken against their kyrgyz neighbors . 
district governmental officials and border guards refused to let uzbek citizens onto the pastures ,  the kyrygz foreign ministry said . 
every year uzbek residents had the possibility to graze their animals on our territory . 
this wasnt always done legally ;  to be more precise ,  there was no legal basis or agreement . 
usually ,  sokh and khushiar residents come to kyrgyzstan with their animals . 
this year we didnt reach any agreements with the uzbek side ,  a batken oblast official who requested anonymity said . 
correspondingly ,  we didnt give out  ( any )  permits . 
that decision aroused discontent in the sokh enclave . 
on the night of may <num>26</num> -<num>27</num>  , a group of unknown individuals attacked kyrgyz citizens near khushiar . 
the assailants vandalised four kyrgyz automobiles and took hostage the drivers and passengers ,  kyrgyz interior ministry spokesman rakhmatillo akhmedov said . 
khushiar residents dispute the kyrgyz claim of hostage-taking and vandalism of four cars . 
only one car was vandalised ,  they said ,  explaining that a brawl broke out when the kyrgyz in the car demanded passage . 
several khushiar residents reached by telephone said kyrgyz border guards are responsible for the troubles . 
they mocked uzbeks ,  forced women to stand and squat repeatedly ,  beat them with rifle butts  ,  said aslan ,  of khushiar . 
uzbekistan ,  in violation of any agreement ,  has introduced a paratrooper battalion into sokh ,  he said . 
we dont know the size of that unit yet ,  but local residents are saying its got <num>1,000</num>  commandoes . 
the list of tit-for-tat incidents is growing . 
uzbeks on may <num>29</num>  blocked the road leading to the kyrgyz village of charbak ,  destroying the road and a water pipe in the process ,  the kyrgyz border guard press service said . 
the incident cut off <num>400</num>  villagers from water and the outside world for several days ,  the border guard said . 
the uzbek authorities ,  who blockaded us ,  are guilty in the entire matter ,  said baktybek ,  who lives in a batken oblast village . 
local residents have blocked our road ,  and we demand closure of the highway between sokh and rishtan . 
rishtan resident odil disputes that . 
they didnt let us onto the pastures ,  and kyrgyz border guards humiliated us ;  thats why we shut down the road . 
but we didnt destroy the water pipe . 
kyrgyz border guards have closed kaitpas ,  the only formal border checkpoint in the region . 
that forces sokh residents and relatives living in larger uzbekistan to go home by circuitous routes . 
the uzbek interior ministry and border guard both refused to comment . 
the situation remains tense ,  witnesses on both sides said . 
when news spread that the kyrgyz and uzbek border guard chiefs were arriving to negotiate ,  crowds gathered along the border . 
derez ,  resident of kyrgyzstans sogment ,  said he was ready to defend his land ,  with a weapon if necessary . 
im <num>40</num>  ;  weve had problems every spring for <num>20</num>  years . 
uzbek border guards come to steal our livestock and rob our women . 
many uzbeks dont even deny that these are our pastures ! 
aziza abiduraslova ,  director of the kyrgyz human rights group kylym shamy ,  points out the kyrgyz law on pastures . 
our citizens are right from the legal point of view . 
the law clearly states that grazing of animals on kyrgyz pastures by foreigners is prohibited ,  she said . 
but we have to look at the human side of the question . 
people aren't guilty ;  what's guilty is the absence of clear borders and the unprofessionalism of border guards in various places "  . 
a ray of hope may come forth from a governors' meeting . 
 " the bilateral meeting that took place in uzbekistan between the governors of the batken and ferghana oblasts ended positively "  ,  said batken oblast government spokesman mamazhan berdishev . 
 " all problems were discussed . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  the situation is better now than it was three or four days ago "  . 
uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan have long-running border disagreements . 
on their <num>1,295</num>  kilometer  border ,  <num>260</num>  kilometer  remains disputed . 
iran accused of supporting afghan insurgents
an afghan soldier places a landmine in a display of iranian supplied weaponry in herat ,  september <num>22</num>  , <num>2007</num>  .
afghan forces have confiscated iranian-made weapons that indicate iranian support and training of terrorists . 
last weeks peace jirga in kabul discussed that issue . 
 [ str / afp / getty images ] 
kabul - in public ,  afghan officials say iran is helping to rebuild their war-ravaged country ,  but privately many afghan officials accuse iran of aiding the insurgency in afghanistan . 
insurgents are receiving training in iran before it sends them to afghanistan to stage attacks ,  an official of the afghan national army  ( ana )  in western afghanistan told central asia online . 
forces have seized evidence ,  including major caches of iranian weapons ,  during operations against the militants ,  he said . 
another reason ,  he explained ,  is irans cultural and economic sway in much of afghanistan ,  particularly in herat ,  farah ,  nimroz and badghis provinces . 
however ,  iran has been supplying the taliban in other provinces too ,  he said . 
he and other officials cited kabul and ghazni in the central zone ,  kunduz and balkh in the north ,  and helmand and kandahar in the south as other destinations for iranian weapons . 
this accusation also surfaced at the recent national consultative peace jirga held in kabul june <num>2</num> -<num>4</num>  .
about <num>1,600</num>  delegates ,  including lawmakers ,  members of the cabinet ,  local officials ,  and representatives of civil society and womens rights organisations ,  attended . 
nearly all of the speakers -including sebghatullah mujaddedi ,  a former afghan president and currently chairman of the senate - blamed iran for providing weapons and training to the taliban and other insurgents . 
they criticised pakistan for the same reasons . 
achieving peace and stability in afghanistan will always be a fantasy if pakistan and iran dont stop providing weapons ,  training and safe havens to the terrorists ,  gul badshah majedi ,  chairman of one of the jirgas <num>28</num>  committees ,  told the delegates . 
effectively countering the insurgency in a country is always a problem if an immediate neighbour of that country provides safe havens to the insurgents ,  said esmat qani ,  a political analyst in kabul . 
hundreds of thousands of afghan refugees have been living in iran and pakistan for the past two decades and ,  because of irans cultural and economic influence on them ,  are vulnerable to exploitation ,  he told central asia online . 
the revolutionary guards of iran has direct ties with many insurgent groups ,  an afghan official who once belonged to the taliban and now serves in the hamid karzai-led administration ,  told central asia online . 
the taliban ruled kabul from <num>1996</num> -to <num>2001</num>  .
at that time ,  iran was an archenemy of the taliban ,  mainly because the taliban and their supporters - al-qaeda ,  saudi arabia and pakistan - were sunni muslims ,  while iran supported the hazaras ,  afghanistans shiite minority . 
another reason was purely political :  the taliban had ambitions beyond afghanistan ,  which iran wanted to contain . 
iran has many reasons to back the militants ,  said ahmad shah pasoon ,  head of the institute of war and peace reporting in helmand ,  the southern afghan province where officials blame both pakistan and iran for supporting the taliban . 
first of all ,  iran ,  like pakistan ,  has strategic interests in afghanistan . 
the iranians want to have influence over the population while seeking a strategic presence here . 
that is a long-term quest ,  he said . 
in the short term ,  iran wants to bleed the  ( coalition )  forces in afghanistan to weaken their presence . 
the difference between how pakistan and iran treat the taliban is that iran keeps the taliban in control ,  pasoon said . 
the taliban supported by iran will never be able to capture even one province in afghanistan . 
their major activities are attacking international interests and government infrastructure here ,  killing officials who oppose irans interests and kidnapping for ransom . 
a former taliban member who underwent training in iran but surrendered to the afghan government in <num>2009</num>  confirmed this allegation to central asia online . 
he was living as a refugee in iran when strangers offered him a handsome salary for joining the taliban ,  he said on condition of anonymity . 
i dont know who they were . 
they were not iranians but got support from someone within the iranian government because they had a lot of money and weapons and moved freely ,  he said . 
they brought me to herat and trained me for about six months ,  he said . 
the trainers were iranians and pakistanis . 
some spoke arabic too . 
after the training ,  we were supplied weapons and were told to carry out attacks on afghan officials and infrastructure like dams ,  roads ,  bridges ,  <abbr>etc.</abbr> 
the iranian government always has rejected these accusations as baseless propaganda by the western media and afghan officials . 
however ,  an iranian researcher who works in tehran ,  told central asia online that iran may have been supporting the insurgency in afghanistan just to block western advances toward the iranian-afghan border . 
we dont want taliban in afghanistan ,  but we also dont like the idea of seeing international forces building military bases and conducting military operations in our neighbourhood ,  he said on condition of anonymity . 
uzbek authorities torture detainees ,  activists say
tashkent -- uzbekistan denies torturing criminal suspects ,  but activists and international groups contend the practice is alive and well . 
they tortured my son ,  and the lawyer we hired did not help ,  said mastura artykova . 
police arrested artykov ,  who was born in <num>1988</num>  , in <num>2009</num>  , on suspicion of robbery . 
artykova said ten policemen burst into their tashkent apartment and took her son away . 
in court ,  artykov said police essentially framed him by photographing him in someone elses clothes and they threatened to place samples of his hair in a mask left behind by one of the robbers ,  artykova said . 
a number of international organisations have repeatedly confirmed that . 
when un secretary-general ban ki-moon visited in april ,  karimov denied human rights abuses occurred . 
but attorneys say torture occurs . 
defence attorney ruhiddin kamilov said investigators obtain <num>90</num>  %  of confessions in political and human rights cases through torture . 
unfortunately ,  uzbekistans … law enforcement officials operate unchecked and unpunished ,  said activist vladimir husainov . 
they will use any means to solve crimes ,  including torture . 
political analyst tashpulat yuldashev said he is sure torture chambers exist . 
the arrested ,  charged and convicted are periodically taken there to have confessions … beaten out of them ,  he said . 
but ,  more than anything ,  inmates fear criminal elements who carry out … orders to beat confessions out of them . 
in uzbekistans jails or prisons it is possible to torture whomever you want however you want ,  and ,  in this respect ,  specially equipped chambers are not necessary ,  said ahmajon normirzayev ,  a human rights activist in namangan and a former police investigator . 
you can torture suspects or ,  even more so ,  convicts in the policemans office . 
but a representative of the sabir-rakhimov regional department of internal affairs in tashkent said thats an oversimplification . 
perhaps young and inexperienced law enforcement officials sometimes exceed their authority ,  but the accused themselves are often to blame ,  the official said . 
they do not co-operate with investigators - they may be answering them rudely . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  sometimes there are abuses of power ,  but this is very rare . 
in <num>2009</num>  , <num>20</num>  former detainees described their alleged ordeals to the human rights alliance of uzbekistan . 
one was aleksandr kuzmin ,  who said police charged him and his wife ,  irina ,  with murder . 
police tortured him for <num>16</num>  days with truncheons and suffocating gas masks and subjected his wife to electroshock ,  he said . 
she received a <num>16</num> -year prison sentence ,  while he got probation . 
police officers raped raihon and hosiyat when they were in custody ,  causing raihon to give birth in prison and driving hosiyat into a psychiatric hospital ,  the sisters contended . 
state-controlled media compounded the sisters ordeal by describing raihon as promiscuous ,  a black mark in a conservative society ,  activists added . 
the torture continues - both physical and moral ,  said normirzayev ,  and no matter how much activists talk about this ,  the situation isnt changing . 
everyone has stopped caring about human rights in uzbekistan . 
osh riots leave at least <num>41</num>  dead ,  <num>454</num>  injured in ethnic clashes
burning buildings in the centre of osh ,  kyrgyzstan  [ posted by uraimov on <url>diesel.kg</url>  ] 
osh -- violence between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks flared up again june <num>10</num>  and <num>11</num>  in osh ,  killing at least <num>41</num>  and injuring at least <num>454</num>  .
pogroms broke out and rioters set public buildings ,  cafes and stores ablaze . 
kyrgyz from neighbouring towns headed for osh ,  causing osh citizens to form volunteer patrols ,  according to latest reports . 
the interim government sent army units ,  police commandoes and additional forces from other parts of kyrgyzstan to restore order ,  but those forces had not yet calmed the situation as dusk settled june <num>11</num>  .
witnesses said fighting broke out june <num>10</num>  between groups of youth of different ethnicities ,  before escalating and spreading across the town . 
police could not quell the unrest . 
fires damaged the symphony hall ,  the drama theatre and several businesses in the centre . 
a gasoline bomb was thrown into the offices of osh tv ,  which was saved from serious damage by fire fighters from a station next door ,  osh tv employees said . 
fires were especially destructive at the frunze bazaar ,  where rows of trading stalls and several cafes and restaurants were damaged . 
several jumped over the fence into our yard and tried to keep going through other yards . 
the city is in chaos ,  said oibek khamidov ,  director of the otkrytaya dolina public organisation . 
people have figured out that nobody is going to protect them and are organising themselves . 
… there are barriers everywhere ,  and movement in all directions is blocked . 
i cant even visit my relatives ,  whom im concerned about . 
the toll of dead and wounded grew throughout the day . 
a public health spokesperson told central asia online shortly before midnight local time that the death toll had reached <num>41</num>  .
a trader at the central market ,  akhmad ,  witnessed a mid-afternoon mass brawl . 
were sitting at home and afraid to go anywhere ,  said zarina iskanova ,  an ethnic uzbek resident of osh . 
we heard kyrgyz outside calling on everyone to unite against the uzbeks . 
when the unrest was just starting ,  we bought groceries and hid at home . 
were terrified . 
everythings shut down now because theyre saying that looting has started . 
with casualties mounting ,  <num>50</num>  doctors raced from bishkek to osh to help treat patients . 
authorities also turned off the city gas supply to prevent fires ,  a gas department official said . 
authorities struggled to master the unfolding events . 
were trying to regain control of the situation ,  a representative of the osh mayor said . 
as night fell ,  authorities reported that the situation had calmed down . 
however in bishkek a number of young men reportedly had boarded <num>13</num>  microbuses to go to osh to support the ethnic kyrgyz . 
interim leader roza otunbayeva issued a statement denouncing the violence . 
she added that government officials were on the scene to survey the situation . 
otunbayeva said that the government sent armoured vehicles and that troops fired into the air to deter further violence . 
authorities arrested five people for attempting to burn down the symphony hall . 
the interim government has amassed all its resources and is confident that it can protect residents . 
however ,  force alone cant solve the problem ,  said alisher sabirov ,  a former parliamentary deputy and one of the leaders of the national uzbek cultural centre . 
its necessary to talk to the people ,  to the elders ,  to explain and clarify ,  he said . 
you have to apply peoples diplomacy ,  seek and attain mutual understanding . 
feliks kulov ,  who held a number of government posts before and forcefully put down riots in osh in <num>1990</num>  , when he was the citys commandant ,  called for stern measures . 
he blamed deposed president kurmanbek bakiyevs supporters . 
 " the only way to solve the situation is to bring in troops from the collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  "  ,  military analyst toktogul kakchekyev said . 
 " interior ministry forces can't control the situation . 
the situation could worsen after darkness falls "  . 
however ,  russian president dmitry medvedev ,  in tashkent for the shanghai co-operation organisation  ( sco )  summit ,  disagreed with the use of csto troops . 
 " the criteria for using csto forces require … an attempt to seize power from outside "  ,  he said . 
 " right now that's not happening . 
everything that kyrgyzstan is dealing with has domestic roots "  . 
uzbekistan has reacted by stepping up border security ,  closing all entry points on its border with kyrgyzstan and sending more troops to the border . 
at the june <num>10</num> -<num>11</num>  sco summit ,  acting kyrgyz foreign minister ruslan kazakbayev described the situation in osh ,  and conference participants announced they would send observers to kyrgyzstan .

as the inter-ethnic fighting continued for a fourth day ,  the interimgovernment in bishkek awaited a decision on what aid the collective security treatyorganisation would provide . 
we are now waiting for some sort of decision regarding peacekeepers , interim president rosa otunbayeva told central asia online . 
we turned to thembecause the situation has reached alarming proportions and we were unprepared to pacify it on our own . 
the ministry of internal affairs press service reported that it has redeployed all possible forces to the south . 
an additional <num>100</num>  commandos arrived in osh june <num>13</num>  .
one was killed when driving through the streets . 
in addition ,  six policemen were killed and <num>17</num>  were wounded . 
the head of the district internal affairs directorate in karasui ,  osh ,  suyunbek omurzakov ,  was killed as he headed for talks with uzbeks . 
his driver was beheaded . 
both sides have reportedly suffered losses . 
the ministry of health said late monday that <num>124</num>  people had died ,  and <num>1,500</num>  were wounded . 
more than <num>800</num>  foreign nationals ,  including turkmen ,  turks and pakistanis in the area ,  have been evacuated . 
the uzbek community reports that at least <num>700</num>  uzbeks have been killed . 
the hospitals do not have enough medicine ,  but there is food since one of oshs grocery stores has opened . 
doctors drive for supplies and food . 
doctors are concerned that with temperatures over <num>30</num>  degrees centigrade ,  the many bodies in the streets could create a public health crisis . 
zhaslan ,  a doctor ,  said it is not safe even for them to drive on the roads . 
a number of our colleagues had their cars taken away and were beaten in dzhalal-abad . 
the biggest problem is with moving humanitarian aid . 
the supply comes from bishkek ,  but how do we deliver it here ? 
uzbek authorities are providing refugees with food and shelter ,  but camps in khanabad and andijan are overflowing . 
andijan human rights activities saidzhahon zainabiddinov ,  who visited the refugee camp ,  said ,  the refugees come to andijan ,  but they are not in the city itself ,  but special camps . 
some of the refugees live with relatives . 
i spoke with a few people . 
according to them ,  the refugees are being provided the necessary help - the wounded are in the hospitals and everyone is being fed . 
… most likely ,  when everything calms down in osh ,  the refugees will return back to osh ,  that is ,  they will not stay in uzbekistan since supporting them is costly for the country . 
khanabad human rights activist dilshod usmanov said ,  the refugees are being placed in school buildings ,  kindergartens ,  and tent cities . 
there are a lot of them - more than <num>40,000</num>  .
whenever possible ,  they are provided with tents ,  medicine and food . 
the locals are also helping them ,  bringing them groceries or already prepared meals and morally supporting them . 
refugees crossed the border at two control points in osh oblast ,  but on the evening of june <num>14</num>  uzbekistan announced that it would close the border . 
two were shot with a machine gun and the rest from an armoured vehicle . 
we have never seen such cruelty ,  said an ethnic uzbek from odiljon . 
dzhalal-abad attempted to hold negotiations between uzbeks and kyrgyz but failed . 
dzhalal-abad oblast state national security service commandant kubatbek baibolov said ,  the situation is stabilising here . 
we arrested a man who has direct ties to organising the upheaval - a member of ak zhol party ,  paizullakh rakhmanov . 
he is now giving his statement . 
the coming nights will be the litmus test . 
the mia is mobilised . 
we are hoping to put down those responsible for the pogroms and provocations . 
the collective security treaty organisations security council secretaries held an emergency consultation june <num>14</num>  in moscow . 
interfax reported that the secretaries agreed on measures to resolve the situation in kyrgyzstan . 
these measures will be reported to presidents of the member countries . 
the members have not excluded the use of any of the cstos potential means . 
but ,  ombudsman tursunbek akun said ,  i do not think that there is any need for peacekeepers now . 
we are dealing with the conflict on our own . 
this could create unnecessary tension . 
osh ,  dzhalal-abad calm ;  constitutional referendum to be held
osh - as relative calm settled over southern kyrgyzstan june <num>15</num>  , residents of osh and dzhalal-abad attempted to return to normal life . 
even as some refugees continued to try to cross into uzbekistans overcrowded camps ,  others returned home . 
osh residents have begun to return home and clean up their streets ,  and some stores have reopened . 
humanitarian aid from bishkek and elsewhere has made it to that city . 
he said the only problem is the lack of groceries . 
in dzhalal-abad ,  the situation has stabilised ,  but there is no food or medicine . 
city officials said several stores have opened and field kitchens have been set up . 
weve been on only bread and water for a few days already . 
if the stores do not open ,  then we will soon run out ,  said dzhalal-abad resident yegor tishkov . 
he said it is most difficult for women and children and that heart medicine is especially needed . 
some <num>75</num>  refugees have returned to dzhalal-abad oblast ,  according to officials . 
zhoomart saparbayev ,  assistant to interim deputy chairman omurbek tekebayev ,  told reporters people have been reassured there is no safety threat ,  but many continue to flee to the uzbek border . 
the kyrgyz government told us before that there was no danger ,  but we see the opposite . 
our friends and relatives have been killed ,  and we have little children . 
we cannot stay here ,  said shahlo ,  as she made her way to the uzbek border with her husband and two children . 
the number of displaced persons in southern kyrgyzstan has reached <num>275,000</num>  , un high commissioner for refugees spokesman andrei makhechich told itar-tass . 
uzbekistans camps have officially registered more than <num>60,000</num>  adults and an unknown number of children . 
some <num>16,000</num>  refugees have received medical assistance . 
the refugees with whom i spoke said that the conditions provided are tolerable ,  said uzbek human rights activist dilarom iskhakova . 
the tents are set up ,  and they are receiving medical help and provisions . 
they are not in need . 
but ,  of course ,  these are not at-home conditions . 
but this is much better than in kyrgyzstan . 
people are willing to endure anything so as not to go back there . 
june <num>16</num>  has been declared a nationwide day of mourning . 
the kyrgyz general prosecutor on june <num>15</num>  requested the extradition of maxim bakiyev from great britain ,  where he was arrested monday . 
interim government deputy chairman azimbek beknazarov said former officials of kurmanbek bakiyevs government organised the events in the south to disrupt the referendum . 
i understand that kyrgyzstans citizens are now dispirited ,  but we must think about the future . 
we must find a solution to this crisis . 
and a referendum is one of these solutions . 
and we must hold it ,  otunbayeva told the media . 
however ,  the political instability has caused some setbacks in referendum preparations . 
the central election commission  ( cec )  issued a statement that the establishment of regional electoral commissions has been suspended . 
according to the un and osce ,  the kyrgyz authorities need to quickly legitimise themselves . 
at a bishkek press conference ,  osce special envoy janybek karibjanov said ,  the referendum is necessary . 
but there is the issue with the situation in the south . 
the interim government says that preparations for further activities are under way . 
obviously ,  everything will depend on the situation in the days to come . 
a number of civil society representatives have proposed different initiatives . 
there is no leader at the helm of the country . 
there is no charisma . 
and now ,  after these events ,  there is no trust in the interim government on the part of the common people . 
we need to proceed as our ancestors did :  convene a national kurultai and choose a leader of the nation ,  said abdyldayev . 
political analysts are calling for the interim government to be more responsible in holding the referendum . 
political scientist zholbors zhorobekov said that any manipulation of the vote could lead to serious protests . 
zhorobekov said many organisational issues will be difficult to resolve as schools and hospitals have been damaged . 
traditionally ,  voting is held and ballot boxes are set up in precisely these locations ,  zhorobekov said . 
where will we hold all this now ? 
the interim government must resolve this issue as quickly as possible . 
kyrgyzstan refugees safe but need humanitarian assistance
a mullah prays from the roof of a truck during the june <num>16</num>  funeral of an ethnic uzbek killed in osh . 
the first humanitarian aid arrived today for tens of thousands who fled ethnic bloodshed in kyrgyzstan . 
osh -- as kyrgyzstan began three days of mourning june <num>16</num>  for those killed in ethnic clashes in the south ,  the interim government appealed for calm and again blamed the fighting on supporters of former president kurmanbek bakiyev . 
the interim government promised to assist bereaved families ,  restore peace in the region and punish those responsible for organising the clashes . 
law enforcement agencies will work on heightened alert through june <num>27</num>  second  referendum . 
the interim government said in a statement it is ready to resign at any time ,  but that under the circumstances ,  no one is able to quickly gain sufficient trust of the people and put the country in order . 
stabilisation is possible only through resolution of certain political issues - specifically ,  the referendum and parliamentary elections . 
the interim government plans to hold elections within the legal time frame after the referendum . 
the interior ministry is investigating <num>111</num>  suspects for attempting to incite unrest ,  said bishkek internal affairs directorate chief zarylbek rysaliyev .

the trust is gone . 
we saw for ourselves how the police killed our innocent people ,  so we are afraid ,  ulugbek said . 
in dzhalal-abad ,  the situation remains tense ,  with the biggest problem being the lack of food . 
in the morning ,  we walk the streets in search  ( of food )  ,  and where we find it ,  they are selling it for three times the price . 
there are people who profit from others grief ,  said dzhalal-abad resident mamleket asanova . 
refugees in dzhalal-abad oblast are unable to enter uzbekistan . 
the influx of refugees is so large in some places that a number of border control points have closed . 
instead ,  refugees have settled in nearby border villages . 
local residents are assisting them and opening their homes to them . 
one family of five is reportedly lodging more than <num>100</num>  people in its home . 
they have given us shelter . 
we are afraid to return to the city even though the shooting is said to have subsided . 
he tried to persuade the refugees to return . 
but some could not be convinced . 
no one can guarantee the police will not start shooting at us . 
he said there is an acute shortage of medicine while he has only painkillers . 
kochkorov also has been treating gunshot victims . 
refugee settlements are not receiving kyrgyzstani humanitarian aid because authorities have been unable to co-ordinate actions to assist the victims . 
ulugbek babakulov ,  editor-in-chief of moskovskii komsomolets v kyrgyzstane ,  said he and his colleagues have informed the health ministry of those areas most in need of medicine .

uzbek journalist artykov bakhodyr ,  who worked at a dzhalal-abad television station ,  said ,  i do not understand why russia and others are helping the kyrgyz . 
they are not the ones who suffered ;  we are . 
they killed people before my very eyes . 
they say everything is in order . 
my husband called and said charges have been brought against me and seven other people ,  as if we were instigators . 
this is not true ! 
in tashkent ,  uzbek first deputy foreign minister abdulaziz komilov said ,  the riots in the city of osh in southern kyrgyzstan were organised by a third-party forces . 
the large number of weapons that entered kyrgyzstan from abroad made this clear .

the collective security threat organisation  ( csto )  in moscow said that it will assist kyrgyzstans law enforcement and security structures .

kyrgyzstan vows referendum will be held ,  crisis will end
dzhalal-abad ,  kyrgyzstan - as interethnic violence in southern kyrgyzstans seemingly comes to an end ,  the interim government said it is searching for the perpetrators of the clashes and has announced changes in the june <num>27</num>  referendum . 
the referendum will not be held under martial law or in a state of emergency instituted over the entirety of kyrgyzstans territory . 
in case of a state of emergency instituted in certain places ,  the referendum will be held on the condition that the number of citizens on the referendum voter list living in these places constitutes less than half of the number of citizens of the kyrgyz republic on the referendum voter list ,  an interim-government press release said . 
official representative of the un secretary-general ,  farhan haq ,  said at a press conference in new york that the un believes that kyrgyzstans decision to hold the referendum on the new draft constitution as scheduled on june <num>27</num>  was a good move . 
he added that the un will provide assistance to ensure the referendum is successfully held . 
in the south ,  people are thinking about their security and peace ,  not about a referendum ,  former minister of emergency situations kamchybek tashiyev told reporters . 
peace is better than a sham of a referendum that only politicians need . 
the health ministry said the death toll from the disturbances that began june <num>11</num>  has reached <num>191</num>  , with <num>2,004</num>  wounded .

people have begun to clean the trash from the streets . 
but tensions ,  of course ,  are high . 
the former minister of emergency situations kamchybek tashiyev said <num>20</num>  %  of dzhalal-abad suffered ,  but most of the city managed to be saved . 
armed patrols are on city centre streets and people have begun to leave their homes . 
however many shops ,  markets and banks remain closed . 
my son is now working on a construction site in smolensk ,  said dzhalal-abad resident firuza solihova . 
every month ,  he sends us <num>300</num>  $  .
this is enough money for our family of six . 
but ,  the bank is closed and we cannot get the money . 
refugees have begun returning to the city and surrounding villages from the uzbek border ,  but there are still many refugees in border towns who lack food ,  medical care and medicine . 
svetlana baitikova ,  an employee at the health ministrys press services ,  said that ,  thanks to reports from journalists working in the conflict zone ,  the ministry has established contact with locals who have formed self-defence headquarters . 
through them ,  the ministry is sending medical supplies directly to the villages . 
we also sent doctors to places where the refugees have gathered ,  but there are still not enough of them ,  she said . 
we are doing everything we can . 
in uzbek districts ,  the people are distrustful of police ,  the military and doctors . 
suraio <abbr>s.</abbr> 
 ,  a resident of the khoja-mahallya suburb ,  said that the uzbeks do not trust kyrgyz doctors now and will not take their wounded to the hospital .

we were afraid that we would not be able to get into uzbekistan . 
they told us that the border guards were only letting women and children in ,  refusing to let men cross .

otunbayeva flew to the countrys south in a bid to calm tensions after admitting the death toll in ethnic clashes could be ten times higher than official figures . 
the interim governments press service recommended that the press cover events in the south ,  by referring only to official sources and speaking exclusively in a neutral tone while on the air . 
the recommendation came after a june <num>17</num>  incident in which a newscaster cried on air while describing the refugees suffering ,  central television channel employees said . 
the government also asked media not to broadcast images of destruction ,  victims ,  blood ,  corpses ,  wounded and not to call the conflict interethnic . 
the government urged media outlets to broadcast uplifting cinema and neutral content such as soviet-period films in russian calling for peace instead .

kyrgyzstan prepares for referendum
the kyrgyz interim government started referendum campaigning just a week ago . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
bishkek - the interim government of kyrgyzstan plans to hold a june <num>27</num>  referendum despite concerns about low turnout ,  and safety in some areas . 
the main reason for the bloody events was the lack of laws and legitimate authority . 
voters will decide on a new constitution ,  the appointment of roza otunbayeva to the presidency until january <num>1</num>  , <num>2012</num>  , and the replacement of the constitutional court with a constitutional chamber of the supreme court ,  central election commission  ( cec )  acting chairman akylbek seriyev said . 
interim government officials warned of potential violence during the vote . 
we know for a fact that destructive forces are preparing a coup ,  acting deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev said . 
a transfer of forces from the countrys south is under way . 
kyrgyz outside the government have also voiced concerns . 
weve had a lot of rumours here at the market ,  said aigul ,  a bishkek resident who sells vegetables . 
she plans to stay home june <num>27</num>  .
the interior ministry and volunteer patrols are charged with ensuring security ,  but such small forces cannot prevent potential provocations ,  said asanbek ,  a patrol member . 
they simply shot the patrol members  ( in dzhalal-abad )  ,  and we still dont know who did it ,  he said . 
patrols can stand up to looters but not to armed fighters . 
other obstacles also portend a poor turnout . 
we are having problems arranging polling stations ,  osh mayor melis myrzakmatov said . 
many buildings were damaged ,  but we are setting up stations in undamaged buildings . 
and refugees who lost their passports may face documentation problems . 
we are working through the possibility of having people not necessarily vote according to their registered residence but by simply showing their passport ,  a cec source said . 
some non-governmental organisations have asked otunbayeva to help refugees recover their documents ,  but many voters might lack motivation to cast ballots . 
i do not see a desire to vote in the refugees ,  nor in most southerners for that matter ,  special interim government representative on refugee matters in the south aigul ryskulova said . 
a low turnout could compromise the legitimacy of the referendum . 
the refugees need to return so that the vote is more legitimate ,  acting justice minister aida salyanova said . 
every citizen should have the opportunity to vote . 
the interim government decreed that the referendum will take place even if a state of emergency prevails in individual oblasts . 
the vote will proceed as long as the voting oblasts represent at least <num>50</num>  %  of the countrys total population . 
decreeing there is no minimum turnout for the referendum was quite timely ,  political scientist jolbors jorobekov said . 
even if one person votes ,  it will be declared valid . 
such a strategy ensures the interim government against a failed turnout in the south . 
the referendum must proceed ,  acting deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev said . 
any serious conflict in the country will turn into war on a regional scale . 
some have called for a postponement of the vote . 
i requested the referendum be postponed ,  saying that it will only catalyse new riots ,  interim coordinator for social issues in the south elmira ibraimova said . 
the south needs to find its relatives corpses and bury the dead . 
holding the vote in this situation ,   ( the government )  is betraying its own people . 
the osce withdrew <num>300</num>  short-term observers from the country for security reasons ,  leaving only <num>90</num>  members of the mission ,  cec member guliya alynbekova said . 
some plan to monitor the vote . 
the osce sends such limited referendum observation teams to avoid validating referendums taking place under conditions that do not permit free and fair voting ,  eurasianet reported . 
a total of <num>108</num>  accredited observers from seven international organisations will monitor the referendum ,  the cec said . 
the new constitution is not worth possible bloodshed ,  said former security council secretary miroslav niyazov . 
this is fetishism ,  he said . 
for the sake of a piece of paper ,  we are ready to cause a massacre in bishkek . 
others have resigned themselves to the situation . 
bishkek resident mirza abdyldayev said he will support the referendum even though he lacks enthusiasm about the government and knows little about the draft constitution . 
electoral fraud has become commonplace for us during the <num>20</num>  years of independence ,  abdyldayev said . 
the previous authorities did all they could to kill faith in honest elections . 
you cannot change everything in two months .

pashtun jirga needed to combat growing militancy
tribal elders discuss social and political issues during a traditional jirga -- historically an effective instrument of conflict resolution in pashtun society . 
pakistan ,  islamabad - a jirga - historically the most effective instrument of conflict resolution in pashtun society - is being considered by some as the last option capable of addressing the prevailing state of unrest in the pashtun areas across the durand line . 
the visible failure of formal state institutions in harnessing the growing militancy and lawlessness in pakistans northwest and tribal areas is paving the way for a revival of the informal but socially effective institution of jirga to address growing militancy and extremism . 
besides addressing inter-tribal disputes ,  pashtun jirgas historically were convened to rally tribes against external threats and common enemies . 
the present situation direly needs a grand pashtun jirga ,  said afzal khan lala ,  a leading nationalist politician who convened the november <num>2000</num>  , pashtun loya jirga in peshawar . 
the two-day peshawar-jirga was attended by a large number of pashtun political leaders ,  tribal elders ,  writers and professionals from all walks of life from pakistan ,  afghanistan and other countries . 
the first task for the jirga is to contemplate how terrorism and militancy gripped the pashtun lands . 
but the vital challenge for the jirga will be formulation of a strategy to get rid of this menace and secure the future generation ,  khan lala said . 
roedad khan ,  a former civil servant and leading columnist ,  said an emergency pashtun jirga must be convened without wasting more time . 
it is time for the pashtun now to sort it out through their qaumi  ( national )  jirga ,  he said . 
roedad also said he opposes the inclusion of political leaders in the jirga process . 
in a pashtun jirga ,  you have to express your mind freely ,  but politicians ,  in any case ,  always follow the party line ,  he said . 
iqbal zafar jaghra ,  secretary general of the leading opposition party ,  the pakistan muslim league  ( pml-n )  ,  also wants to convene the jirga ,  but disagrees with roedad and khan lala about its representation . 
the jirga i have in my mind is a type of mini apc  ( all parties conference )  of pashtun political leaders representing all political outfits of country ,  jaghra said . 
he added he thinks this jirga must deliberate about how to end militancy in the pashtun areas . 
the veteran league leader said decisions made in jirga through consensus have a built-in implementation mechanism due to their moral authority and weight . 
however ,  keeping the complexity of the conflict in mind ,  jaghra believes the jirga needs to be broad-based . 
he believes jirga represents the collective approach of pashtun to any external threat . 
once militants and extremists are declared as the enemy then pashtuns ,  as a nation ,  will view them as the enemy . 
only through a jirga can these elements be isolated . 
salim saifullah khan ,  president of pakistan muslim league  ( pml )  and a senior pashtun politician ,  said he has considered organising a jirga for some time . 
salims family has successfully organised a local lashkar  ( private army )  through a jirga in his home district lakki marwat . 
lakki marwat ,  in the southern nwfp and bordering tribal areas ,  is successfully secured by the local lashkar from the militants . 
pashtun poet believes the pen is mightier than the sword
abdurrahman roghani is a pashtun poet who advocates peace in a war-torn country . 
 [ shaheen buneri ] 
the imam has nothing but to instill fear in my heart , 
the leader of the nation has sold his conscience for monetary gains , 
the flowers of hope are burnt in the flames of fire , 
the river of swat is stained with human blood , 
i have broken both my head and my glass full of wine at the doors of the tavern , 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- if there was a paradise on earth ,  that was the beautiful valley of swat . 
it had heritage ,  history and traditions based on love and peace ,  said abdurrahman roghani . 
a resident of matta town  ( upper swat )  ,  roghani has experienced hard times . 
he is a poet with a rebellious soul and romantic imagination . 
during his <num>35</num> -year literary career ,  he has always advocated that life can be beautified and made worth living by following the purity of nature . 
all religions are peace ;  this is personal greed and vested interests that fan war and violence in every part of the world ,  he said . 
roghani was the only powerful voice that rose against the taliban for imposing their will on the people to promote their global jihadist agenda . 
it is not possible to stop the ever-flowing stream of life forcefully . 
 ( the )  human heart can only be dominated by love and affection ,  not weapons and war ,  he said . 
the militants singled him out for his romantic verses ,  his progressive thoughts ,  and his role as the most popular social figure in the area . 
in july <num>2007</num>  , the taliban established their headquarters in matta and started torturing people who they considered opponents to their religious ideology . 
in the taliban view ,  roghani was the messenger of the devil ,  a poet who composed bad verses ,  encouraged people to send girls to schools and not to be influenced by the talibans preaching . 
soon it became impossible to stay back at home . 
i decided to migrate to nearby miandam valley ,  but local taliban sympathizers viewed me with suspicion . 
four of my children are at a tender age ;  they were very confused and terrified over the evolving situation . 
they could not understand why people were being killed and their houses destroyed ,  roghani explained . 
swabi is about <num>150</num>  kilometres from mingora and roghani recalls that the journey was one of unparalleled suffering for the thousands of children ,  women and elderly people who were forced to leave their homes by the conflict . 
i threw a last glance at my valley and the deserted homes and took my family to move forward for an unknown destination . 
on the way ,  women were weeping ,  cursing both militants and the military for bringing war to their homes ,  he said . 
the war and migration made deep impressions on roghani and brought a major shift in his literary pursuits . 
roghani said his verses took on a sad tone after witnessing so much death and destruction . 
with the military operation in its final phase in swat and the majority of displaced people back in their homes ,  roghani ,  too ,  has returned to his home town . 
he lives in a two-room rented house with his family . 
the war has badly shaken the social and economic infrastructure in the valley ,  and roghani is struggling to survive and feed his family with the monthly stipend from the government in return for his services as a school teacher and an honorarium from the pakistan academy of letters . 
roghani is working on a book about the social ,  cultural ,  economic and psychological consequences of the conflict . 
he has published three collections of his poetry . 
the tragedy in our lives is so huge ,  that i cant accommodate it in verses . 
now i have started writing in prose ,  he explains . 
though he seems satisfied with the military action ,  he thinks victory in the war against terrorism is a long way off . 
nightingales of swat back in homes and singing
shabnam <num>28</num>  , a singer and dancer from the swat region ,  talks to central asia online about her return to singing now that the talibans fundamentalism is out of favour in the area . 
 [ hasan khan ] 
mingora ,  pakistan - after a two-year break from singing ,  shabnam and her sister shabnam are back on stage ,  once again able to entertain their fans . 
the melodious voices of these singers and the sounds of all instruments fell silent in the valley when militants gained control . 
the militants ,  who believe such pleasures are forbidden in islam ,  threatened all entertainers . 
most musicians in the valley not only abandoned their artistic careers ,  but publically denounced singing and dancing ,  vowing to follow shariah ,  as defined by the militants . 
he requested ,  however ,  that his daughters not be asked about the taliban ,  as they still fear being targeted if they spoke against them . 
sitting beside shabnam and her father ,  shabnam disputed the popular perception in the valley that the taliban wanted to kill her but mistakenly targeted her namesake ,  shabnam the elder ,  who was <num>31</num>  when she was killed . 
this is ridiculous and nonsense ,  she said . 
personally ,  i never got any threat from taliban . 
shabnam said that when the taliban advised her family to give up music her father publically renounced the profession and stopped both sisters from performing . 
she recalled people saying the late shabnam attended some music functions despite taliban orders . 
so ,  i think ,  she was targeted for defying the taliban ,  shabnam said ,  shrugging her shoulders . 
however ,  recalling the murder of shabnam ,  she said the news shook the whole community . 
it was terrible . 
unbelievable for everybody ,  shabnam said . 
after the elder shabnams death ,  she said ,  most musicians burned their instruments . 
after the successful military operation in malakand ,  the singers and dancers returned home ;  however ,  shabnam said ,  everybody is more vigilant about entertaining guests or accepting invitations for parties . 
we accept only those invitations which come from trusted people or are referred by those whom we know very well ,  she said . 
i dont know why ,  but my heart is down and everything seems depressing . 
shabnam and shabnam said there was a lot of business ,  both at homes and outdoor concerts ,  before the taliban . 
both were optimistic about the future of music in the valley . 
now everything is in control of the army and there is peace ;  however ,  it will take a long time to get normal ,  shabnam said . 
according to the singer ,  it all depends on peace . 
one railway for three countries
the prospects for construction were once again discussed at a recent meeting of the chinese-kyrgyz group of experts . 
it seems that it will still be many months before a start is made on construction . 
an electric train leaves beijing railway station october <num>2006</num>  .
 ( getty images ) 
the parties have also agreed on the construction of transfer stations . 
the kyrgyz station will be located in the region of the tuz-bel pass ,  and the chinese will build a second on their territory . 
the railway will not only re-animate naryn district but will also provide an opportunity to develop new iron and coal deposits . 
at present ,  even with a working kara-kech section ,  it is extremely difficult to move coal . 
moreover ,  it will be possible for many kyrgyz people to find employment constructing and maintaining the railway . 
but are there specialists in the republic itself who would be able to build and efficiently operate a high-mountain main line railway whose construction will take place under complex climatic conditions ? 
the construction workers will have to dig <num>48</num>  tunnels and build <num>19</num>  bridges . 
and the highest elevation on the railway will be at <num>3,600</num>  metres . 
there will be an international bidding process to decide who is best prepared to work under these severe conditions . 
chinese ,  south korean ,  and american companies are already showing interest in the project . 
but the kyrgyz companies can show only a sporting interest because they mostly have no financial backing . 
what is needed to realise this project is first and foremost the creation of an international consortium with the participation of private and government investors . 
when this is done the investors will own <num>49</num>  %  of the shares while the controlling packet will remain in the hands of the ktzh state concern . 
any investor who would like to control <num>51</num>  percent of the shares must invest at least <num>1</num>  $  billion  [ usd ]  in the construction .

 ( photo by cancan chu / getty images ) 
the total cost of the project ,  initially set at <num>1.35</num>  $  billion ,  has already swelled to <num>2</num>  $  billion ,  taking into account price increases and inflation . 
and even this figure is not final . 
in order to recoup costs over <num>10</num> -<num>15</num>  years and start to bring in a steady profit ,  it will be necessary to move at least <num>15</num>  million tonnes of freight annually . 
this volume of freight is also included in the preliminary technical-economic specifications . 
however ,  the volume of freight through the neighbouring dostyk-alashankou control-and-entry point at the chinese-kazakh border will scarcely be <num>10</num>  million tonnes after more than <num>15</num>  years . 
last year ,  at the kyrgyz torugar control-and-entry point along the already existing rail line ,  there were <num>210,540</num>  tonnes of imports ,  <num>13,528</num>  tonnes of exports ,  and <num>6,667</num>  tonnes of transit freight . 
during the first half of this year the amount of freight passing through the torugart control-and-entry point in both directions was on the order of <num>144,298</num>  tonnes ,  and through the irkeshtam point it was only <num>116,050</num>  tonnes of imported goods . 
in this project the chinese leadership is pursuing primarily economic aims ,  with political goals secondary . 
the new railway will connect the central asian region even more closely with china . 
in addition ,  china is very interested in developing its western provinces and so ,  for it ,  the railway is simply essential . 
for connections with europe ,  china uses sea routes . 
europe ,  it seems from all evidence ,  is happy with the existing arrangement ,  otherwise it would long ago have financed the construction of the railway . 
with respect to kazakhstan ,  it ,  like russia ,  has no interest in the completion of this project . 
rather these countries are striving to reduce the investment attractiveness of the proposed railway . 
russia ,  for instance ,  has already lowered the cost of freight and is reducing transit time across its territory . 
it is also actively improving the infrastructure of the trans-siberian railway and offering good guarantees for the security of freight and its unhampered delivery . 
security forces claim to have cleared bara from lashkar-i-islam
paramilitary forces in the khyber pass report they have secured the area against militants . 
their numbers were increased after a spike in attacks on supplies to afghanistan . 
 [ m . 
ibrahim ] 
khyber agency ,  pakistan -- though three successive military operations have damaged the structural bases of militant organizations in bara tehsil of the khyber tribal region ,  local residents say more must be done to cleanse the region of militancy . 
military officials ,  however ,  claim that most of the goals of the operation have been achieved . 
avoiding direct comments and disclosure of their names ,  officials replied to written questions from central asia online ,  saying that capturing the top leadership of militant organizations has never been our military objective ,  but adding that the objectives which we set have largely been achieved . 
elaborating ,  they claimed that bara is substantially cleansed of militants ,  illegal fm radio stations closed ,   ( and the )  confidence of the local population restored alongside gradual revival of local peace committees . 
official claims of achievement of the objectives are evidenced by the disappearance of armed patrols by lashkar-i-islam  ( li )  militants . 
a local journalist who monitors the situation told central asia online on condition of anonymity that li ,  the fm radio station ,  has also halted its transmissions due to effective measures adopted by the security forces . 
the li was using an illegal fm radio station to terrorize opponents ,  issue self-styled islamic edicts and broadcast propaganda . 
however ,  one bara resident ,  zarmat shah ,  told central asia online that some militant organizations were still collecting donations for their holy cause and forcing local youth to secretly join their ranks . 
security forces have imposed <num>14</num> -hour curfews in most parts of bara in order to restrict the movement of suspect militants . 
military officials claimed that with a substantial reduction in the crime rate in bara and destruction of the houses and bases of militant groups ,  the confidence of the local population is restored and they have started giving information and support against militants . 
but the clashes between security forces and militants rendered thousands of bara residents homeless and forced them to relocate to refugee camps near peshawar . 
a journalist observed during a visit to the jalozai camp ,  where most of baras idps are ,  that more than half of the families were without tents and other necessities for lack of registration . 
mula khel ,  a displaced person from bara ,  said his family had to share a small tent with relatives as they had yet been registered after <num>45</num>  days . 
many bara residents worry that as soon as the military operation ends ,  militant groups will re-emerge . 
shahid ali ,  a concerned bara resident ,  said ,  more than a dozen government installations and educational institutions have been destroyed since the start of the military operation which shows the strength and boldness of militant groups operating in bara . 
he said a number of local residents and lower level government officials had either been killed or abducted by militant organizations on suspicion of supporting the military operation . 
the influence of the li on local residents can be gauged from the more than <num>600</num>  khasadar personnel  ( informal tribal security force )  who resigned when they were threatened by li chief mangal bagh soon after the start of military operations . 
the most recent military operation started september <num>1</num>  , <num>2009</num>  ;  the first was launched in june <num>2008</num>  , with a second in december <num>2008</num>  .
the burning and destruction of educational institutions forced the local political administration to close all educational institutions . 
an intermediate level student ,  haroon afridi ,  told central asia online that thousands of bara students missed their mid-term examinations and promotion to new classes as a result . 
bara ,  just <num>7</num>  kilometres from peshawar ,  shares borders with the orakzai tribal agency on the southwest and darra adamkhel on the southeast . 
nwfp officials and political leadership have accused the lashkar-i-islam of most kidnappings ,  targeted killings ,  bomb blasts and the forceful implementation of a particular brand of shariah in peshawar and its suburbs . 
peace could only be restored in the restive city of peshawar if military organizations operating in tribal areas bordering peshawar are tackled head-on ,  he said . 
officials ,  however ,  insisted that they have secured the city of peshawar from militants and were preparing for subsequent operations against militants in tirah ,  a remote valley bordering afghanistan and the orakzai tribal region . 
officials believe many militants fled south waziristan for orakzai and the mountainous region of tirah valley . 
now with effective preventive steps taken by the government ,  armed attacks against our vehicles carrying fuel and other supplies to… afghanistan via torkhum border had considerably reduced ,  acknowledged shakir afridi ,  a trucking firm owner in the tribal area . 
journalism slowly finds its way back to swat
swat residents read newspapers at a roadside stall in mingora in <num>2008</num>  .
after the fall of the taliban ,  a new rsf report says ,  the press is gradually returning to the swat valley . 
 [ tariq mahmood / afp / getty images ] 
washington ,  dc -- journalists have gradually returned to work in the swat valley of the north-west frontier province  ( nwfp )  after many were forced to suspend or move operations in <num>2008</num>  and <num>2009</num>  , says a reporters sans frontieres  ( rsf )  report ,  back to swat :  press freedom after the taliban defeat . 
the situation is much better now in swat after the rah-e-rast  [ operation straight path ]  military operation against the militants ,  said ghulam farooq ,  editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper shamal in swat . 
after the military operation was launched in may <num>2009</num>  against the mullah fazlullah-led tahreek-e-nifaz-e-shariah muhammadi ,  all the media outlets shut down in the area . 
some of them ,  such as the daily azadi ,  moved to islamabad due to the miserable situation for media in the area ,  he told central asia online . 
the press club has opened . 
 <abbr>…</abbr>  people can now watch tv ,  and reporters can move around generally without risking their lives . 
iqbal khattak ,  rsfs representative in pakistan ,  told central asia online ,   ( the press )  is back in swat after the military pushed out the militants . 
i think as the security situation gets better ,  the press freedom situation will also improve . 
now the ball is in the governments court ,  he added . 
the government has to look for the killers of several journalists who were murdered in the district during the taliban-linked militancy . 
if press freedom violations continue in the district ,  then only the government will be held responsible . 
we hope the government and the military will respect press freedom and allow journalists to work without any fears . 
khattak said ,  the press under the taliban worked in a difficult environment . 
the taliban did not accept an unbiased and impartial press and abhorred criticism . 
it wanted the press to look at it through taliban eyes . 
in general ,  journalists feel safer now . 
i no longer carry a pistol with me ,  and neither does my guard ,  express news tv bureau chief shireen zada told rsf . 
previously ,  i had to reach home before sunset ,  but now i am in the bazaar or office until late at night . 
according to an rsf press release ,  this strategic region north of islamabad underwent a great deal of turmoil from <num>2007</num>  to <num>2009</num>  .
… then ,  in may <num>2009</num>  , the army launched  [ an ]  operation with the aim of reasserting its authority . 
more than <num>2</num>  million people ,  including most journalists ,  fled the region to escape the violent clashes . 
this report also aims to alert the authorities to crimes committed against journalists in the valley that have gone unpunished . 
one year after reporter mosa khankhels murder on february <num>18</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , near mingora ,  those responsible have yet to be identified . 
his brother told rsf there is no ongoing investigation . 
according to the rsf report ,  cable tv service and internet cafes are back after the end of a taliban ban ,  and a boom in the sale of tv sets suggests that residents no longer fear taliban reprisals for the possession of non-islamic objects . 
recalling the media situation in swat under the taliban ,  farooq said ,  if the media called the taliban militants ,  the media came under fire from the taliban ,  but if we called the militants taliban ,  then we were under fire from the army . 
we were really confused how to use terms like suicide bomber . 
… today ,  after the fall of the taliban ,  the situation is much better . 
taliban bringing back corporal punishment in tribal districts
this photo taken from a taliban video shows militants holding down and flogging a <num>17</num> -year-old girl in the swat districts kabal tehsil last april . 
militants use flogging to terrorise the population . 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- a new video of taliban members whipping men and a teenager in a tribal district has rattled pakistan for the second time in less than a year as the military offensive against militants in south waziristan grinds on . 
a man reportedly shot the video on a mobile phone february <num>3</num>  , and it has since been aired by television stations and appeared on youtube and other internet sites . 
tribal sources in the orakzai tribal district told central asia online that a local commander of hakeemullah mehsuds tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  was whipping victims in the mamozai area . 
having gun-wielding militants administer corporal punishment in public is an old taliban tactic to keep the local population  " terrorised "  and to portray militants as  " saviours "  . 
the video makes clear the grip of the taliban on that tribal district . 
the federal government is currently using air power to soften up militant positions before sending ground troops to take hold of the region . 
it has served as a base from which militants attempt to penetrate into the khyber tribal district ,  which borders peshawar . 
on april <num>4</num>  last year ,  a similar video shook pakistani tv viewers . 
in that video ,  a taliban commander flogged a <num>17</num> -year-old girl being held face down in a public space in kabal tehsil of the swat valley . 
government forces later drove the militants out of the valley . 
 " leave me for a moment . 
in the latest video ,  orakzai taliban punished several men for  " speaking out against the militants "  ,  according to local residents . 
the militants ,  conscious of public opinion ,  are complaining about the broadcast of the video . 
militant commander mullah said khan issued a warning to a pakistani tv channel last week for using the video as  " propaganda "  against the taliban . 
the audience ,  in the video ,  mostly old men and young boys ,  watched the beatings in silence . 
the announcement did not explain the old man's offence . 
local residents identified the stocky-looking bearded man whipping the men and the teenager as mullah toofan ,  a local taliban commander in the orakzai tribal region . 
high-level jirga fails to hand over militants
in this <num>2007</num>  photo ,  pakistani tribal elders gather for a jirga in the mohmand agency bordering afghanistan . 
a february <num>10</num>  jirga in tank refused to deliver taliban militants to the government until peace is restored . 
 [ str / afp / getty images ] 
tank ,  pakistan -- a high-level jirga of the mehsud tribe failed to reach agreement with the government on handing over more than <num>300</num>  militants before a lasting peace is restored in south waziristan . 
some <num>400</num>  leaders of the mehsud tribe met political agent shahab ali shah ,  the ranking government official of south waziristan ,  in tank ,  north-west frontier province ,  february <num>10</num>  .
the tribal leaders said they would not hand over <num>378</num>  militants ,  including tehreek-e-taliban pakistan chief hakeemullah mehsud to the administration until peace is restored . 
hakeemullah is reported to be dead . 
the tribal elders stressed the government must ensure the return of thousands of displaced mehsuds before it can expect co-operation from them . 
the february <num>10</num>  jirga was the third on this issue in the past two months . 
government officials in charge of restive south waziristan wanted the mehsud tribesmen to abide by the collective territorial responsibility clause of the frontier crimes regulation to protect their territory against taliban insurgents . 
under the regulation ,  officially designated tribal elders  ( maliks )  must help establish peace and take punitive action against miscreants when the government asks . 
these elders in return receive privileges from the government . 
two earlier meetings also ended inconclusively ;  officials have set another jirga for february <num>20</num>  .
sources in tank told central asia online that shah made it clear to the mehsud elders that a military operation against the taliban and foreign associates was imperative after the collapse of earlier peace deals with militants . 
taliban funding traced to gulf countries
pakistani soldiers guard site of taliban bombing that killed four school girls . 
london -- the subject of donations that fund the taliban and possibly al-qaeda ,  particularly from individuals in the gulf region ,  is becoming a nightmare for the security agencies responsible for choking off the funding sources of both these groups . 
an arab diplomat ,  speaking on condition of anonymity ,  said that security agencies in the gulf have been able to track money transfers whose ultimate destination is believed to be the taliban movement . 
these transfers are estimated at <num>100</num>  $  million annually by the us media . 
the agencies that are tracking the money flow also noted a change in the way these donations are transferred in order to hide the real identity of the donors . 
security agencies leading the fight against taliban funding are concerned that some donors ,  whether they are from the gulf or other countries around the world ,  might not be aware that the money they give to the taliban ends up funding bombing operations whose victims are innocent people ,  even though the taliban claims to target western forces or soldiers of the afghan government . 
on february <num>3</num>  , the taliban in pakistan claimed responsibility for an attack near a girls' school that led to the killing of eight people ,  including four school girls and three american soldiers who were attending the opening of the school  ( built with american money )  . 
the movement has frequently targeted girls' school in the country ,  burning many of them to ground ,  and it is even suspected of being behind many attacks that took place in public places in pakistan last year . 
pakistan's taliban also claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed <num>43</num>  people in the commercial capital karachi on december <num>30</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
these attacks ,  which resulted in hundreds of civilian victims ,  especially one in peshawar on october <num>28</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , even led al-qaeda to condemn it as being un-islamic . 
in the aftermath of the september <num>11</num>  , <num>2001</num>  attacks in new york and washington ,  the united states and other western and arab countries led a massive campaign to shut off the funding sources of al-qaeda . 
it was also reported that those who wished to receive military training in camps linked with the taliban in pakistan were asked to bring money whereas in the past the training was free . 
but after years of this partial success of the campaign to dry up al-qaeda's funding sources ,  it appears that those willing to send donations to that organisation or to the taliban in afghanistan have been able to devise new ways of sending money without having to use financial institutions which might be under security monitoring ,  or which might reveal the sources of these donations . 
a diplomat from one of the gulf states ,  who spoke to this writer under condition of anonymity ,  said that gulf security agencies have in recent years tracked an increasing amount of donations that were funnelled to pakistan and afghanistan . 
he indicated that a high percentage of transfers are carried out by foreigners working in the gulf and not directly through gulf nationals . 
by not getting directly involved in the transfer of funds ,  the gulf national is able to avoid being accused of  " supporting terrorism "  . 
the gulf diplomat said that the high number of afghan and pakistani workers in the gulf allows for the transfer of large amounts of money from the gulf countries without any trace of its real origin . 
some of those who make the transfer - when asked about the origin of what they were transferring - say that the money belonged to them and their fellow compatriots ,  which they earned from work . 
they claim they would deliver the money to the families of these workers when they get back to their remote villages in their home country ,  whether it is in pakistan or afghanistan . 
after the funds leave the gulf ,  it is hard to track their final destination ,  but officials believe part of the money undoubtedly goes to fund the taliban ,  the diplomat said . 
although there are no exact statistics on the amount of money that is transferred to this organisation ,  estimates published last year indicate that the amount of donations received by the rebel movement exceed the amount it receives from taxes levied on drug traffickers in afghanistan . 
in the past ,  it was believed that most of the taliban funding came from duties levied on drug trafficking . 
some leaders in the movement obtained a specified percentage  ( sometimes reaching <num>10</num>  %  )  from the poppy  ( from which opium is extracted )  growers in the regions under taliban control in the south of afghanistan ,  particularly in helmand province . 
however ,  a report published in the washington post last year ,  said that taliban leaders and their associates received <num>10</num>  %  in <num>2008</num>  in foreign donations from the middle east and the gulf . 
foreign donations surpassed the amount of money gained by the movement from taxes on drug trafficking ,  estimated at <num>2008</num>  . 
a conference held this month in london to support afghanistan pledged to offer <num>2008</num>  in international funding to the afghan government in order to carry on with its programme to assimilate taliban fighters who abandon their violent activities and abide by the afghan constitution . 
the afghan government project seeks to provide financial support to fighters who agree to stop fighting ,  in consideration of the fact that a large number of the movement's fighters join the rebellion not because of ideological convictions ,  but because of personal circumstances ,  notably the lack of employment opportunities in their local areas . 
if it turns out that the afghan government is able to  " neutralise "  a particular group of rebels and help them assimilate into society ,  it would constitute a winning point against its enemies such as taliban leaders under mulla mohammad omar ,  who vowed to overthrow the government of hamid karzai and expel foreign forces .

serajuddin ,  a key taliban commander ,  and four arab insurgents linked to the taliban ,  died in an air strike in washir ,  said daud ahmadi ,  spokesman for helmand governor gulab mangal . 
serajuddin was a taliban chief in helmands neighbouring province of farah . 
afghan and nato officials claim to have cleared part of the two contested districts ,  nad ali and marjah . 
however ,  they acknowledge that improvised explosive devices and sniper fire have slowed the progress of operation moshtarak . 
afghan defence minister general abdul rahim wardak ,  interior minister mohammad hanif atmar and helmand governor gulab mangal addressed a joint press conference february <num>16</num>  in lashkargah ,  helmand ,  to discuss the course of the fighting . 
wardak invited armed taliban members under siege in marjah and nad ali to lay down their weapons and join the government . 
those armed taliban who are under siege in marjah and nad ali can return to the government . 
their lives will be protected ,  and work will be provided for them ,  said wardak . 
he said afghan forces were playing a key role and termed moshtarak a successful operation . 
he rejected rumours that <num>15,000</num>  troops had taken part and said that only <num>5,000</num>  troops ,  including afghan and coalition forces ,  were involved . 
after completion of the operation in marjah ,  a battalion of police will deploy to helmand to ensure security and to serve the public ,  atmar said . 
mangal lauded co-ordination among the troops participating in the operation . 
taliban accused of using helmand civilians as human shields

a nato military commander was quoted by rfe / rl february <num>17</num>  as saying afghan and coalition forces have significantly dislocated the militants local leadership . 
but news media also reported heavier fighting in marjah and the use of aircraft to support afghan and international troops . 
the area near marjah remains heavily mined . 
according to news reports ,  the mines are killing a significant number of civilians . 
according to the nation ,  saleem said the military increased security because only two afghan border checkpoints existed in helmand . 
he said the military had stationed more troops at the chaman border checkpoint adjacent to spin boldak and kandahar . 
pakistani forces are also carrying out aerial surveillance of the border ,  the nation reported . 
taliban takes aim at school buildings
teachers work outdoors as students assemble in the distance at a tent school in pakistan set up by the government to replace a school destroyed by taliban militants . 
peshawar ,  pakistan - militants have taught pakistan some tough lessons . 
among them is that the countrys education system is a prime target for militants trying to coerce the people and undermine the state . 
a senior police official in peshawar said such destruction is designed to pressure the government to stop action against the taliban or surrender to their dictates . 
to date ,  al-qaeda and the taliban have destroyed some <num>800</num>  schools in the pashtun belt ,  which includes pakistans north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  and the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  bordering afghanistan . 
such action literally leaves the government picking up the pieces to continue education programmes . 
azra ,  <num>14</num>  , a 4th-class student ,  shook as a cold breeze hit her face at the site of her destroyed school in kabal ,  in the swat district . 
it is very cold to sit in the open ,  azra ,  said . 
such conditions make the already difficult task of education that much more difficult ,  raising the prospect that already low literacy rates may slip . 
government figures for the nwfp indicate literacy is <num>26</num>  percent for females and <num>45</num>  percent for males . 
the swat ,  buner ,  upper and lower dir ,  shangla and malakand districts have <num>273</num>  destroyed schools ;  another <num>367</num>  are damaged ,  according to data from the provincial education department in peshawar . 
the conservatives ,  when they were not as armed as they are today ,  used to say whoever gets modern education will find a place in hell . 
the destruction of schools began in <num>2008</num>  and still continues . 
a militant spokesman ,  ikramullah mohmand ,  in the mohmand tribal district phoned local journalists february <num>21</num>  to say another school in lakaro region has been destroyed . 
some <num>100,000</num>  students in swat alone have been affected by the attacks . 
they do not want the pashtuns to prosper like others . 
the destruction of schools is continuation of their hatred of education ,  sardar hussain babak ,  the provincial minister for education ,  said . 
tribal areas along the afghan border have also suffered losses . 
the bajaur district reports <num>74</num>  schools destroyed ;  the mohmand tribal district ,  bordering bajaur ,  has lost <num>35</num>  schools . 
surprisingly ,  militants in north and south waziristan have not been destroying schools . 
the taliban in waziristan have not been destroying the schools ;  rather ,  they use them as bases ,  said dilawar wazir ,  a journalist in south waziristans wana town . 
the tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  used a government high school building in kotkai ,  south waziristan ,  to train suicide bombers . 
former ttp chief baitullah mehsud ,  who was killed in a missile attack last august ,  used the same building to talk to journalists in may <num>2008</num>  .
a preliminary damage assessment report by the provincial disaster management authority in peshawar said reconstruction of the schools will cost us <num>68.1</num>  $  million . 
there are serious concerns about when the schools will be rebuilt . 
in areas where militancy still prevails ,  reconstruction is difficult to start . 
but the money is elusive . 
the government is quick to make commitments but slow to release funds . 
about one-third of the money needed has been pledged by foreign countries and donors . 
naturally ,  we cannot bear these losses alone . 
the federal government and international donors must honour pledges to reconstruct these schools ,  sardar hussain said . 
suicide bombers hit kabul ,  killing <num>17</num>  and wounding <num>36</num> 
afghan security forces carry a wounded boy outside the park residence guesthouse at the site of a gun battle in kabul february <num>26</num>  .
a suicide bomber set off a huge explosion near a shopping and hotel complex early in the morning ,  and police killed two other would-be attackers ,  officials said . 
reports say <num>17</num>  died and <num>36</num>  were wounded . 
 [ behrouz mehri / afp / getty images ] 
initial reports say <num>17</num>  died and <num>36</num>  were wounded . 
rfe / rl ,  citing officials ,  said that the explosions killed a frenchman and an italian diplomat and wounded eight indian doctors . 
a number of afghan policemen also were reported killed as gun battles continued for several hours ,  and the news media circulated images of security personnel carrying wounded afghan citizens from the area . 
according to news reports ,  the taliban claimed responsibility ,  saying it sent five suicide bombers . 
afghan police said they fatally shot several attackers . 
siamak herawi ,  deputy spokesman for afghan president hamid karzai ,  condemned the attack ,  saying ,  those people who are carrying out these actions are the enemies of peace and the afghan people . 
he praised the quick response of afghan security forces . 
we appreciate their efforts to end the violence in a short period of time ,  he said . 
loan project in kunar province proves to be a great success
a small loans project is proving a great success in kunar with more than <num>1,000</num>  afghans so far having taken advantage of the scheme to improve their lives . 
already <num>1,346</num>  residents of the asadabad and sarkano districts have received funds and paid them back . 
another female loan recipient ,  who preferred not to give her name ,  is working as a seamstress . 
in this conservative society where many girls are still not allowed to go to school ,  maderas programme provides a unique opportunity for women to generate income for their families - and raise their social status by becoming breadwinners . 
now she is able to provide for her family with income from embroidery work . 
after my wedding ,  i didnt have a good life ,  haseema said . 
with madera income ,  my life improved . 
my husband wasnt working ,  so this eased our life and situation . 
im more independent now . 
madera has offered loans to people in kunar for three years now ,  explains said jauhar shah jalali ,  provincial coordinator at the kunar office . 
this is a good programme with good success ,  he said ,  sitting at maderas leafy ,  quiet compound near asadabad . 
pakistan demands baloch terror suspects in exchange for mullah baradar
pakistani mourners carry the coffin of baloch provincial education minister shafiq ahmed in quetta october <num>26</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
gunmen killed ahmed october <num>25</num>  , and hundreds of others have died since a baloch insurgency flared up in <num>2004</num>  .
intelligence sources tell central asia online that pakistan has demanded that afghanistan hand over baloch fugitives in exchange for mullah baradar . 
islamabad - the pakistani government has demanded that afghanistan hand over wanted baloch terrorism suspects living in afghanistan in return for mullah baradar and other taliban leaders arrested in pakistan . 
they are all wanted in pakistan on charges of committing acts of terror in balochistan . 
pakistan arrested baradar - the talibans no <num>2</num>  man - in karachi in february . 
it also captured other key taliban members - including mullah amir mohammad ,  mullah abdul salaam ,  and reportedly mullah kabir . 
soon after those arrests ,  the afghan government demanded that pakistan hand them over to kabul for trial . 
afghan president hamid karzai and interior minister hanif atmar have since talked to top pakistani political and military leaders about the extraditions . 
pakistan initially expressed a willingness to extradite the detainees to afghanistan ;  however ,  a pakistani provincial court ordered the government to comply with legal and constitutional formalities before performing any extraditions . 
pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gilani ,  addressing a march <num>14</num>  joint press conference with karzai ,  said islamabad would hand over the taliban leaders to kabul after fulfilling legal formalities . 
intellectual terrorism termed more dangerous than physical
members of the amn tehreek  ( peace movement )  demonstrate in peshawar against any form of terrorism and demand peace on their land in this file photo . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
having deemed intellectual terrorism far more dangerous than physical terrorism ,  religious scholars ,  intellectuals ,  educationists and government officials are seeking to take concrete steps against the trend . 
this is a very dangerous trend ,  said dr farooq khan ,  a psychiatrist and religious scholar . 
the reason is that having educated people somehow legitimises terrorism and that supports al-qaeda . 
intellectual terrorism is a far serious and challenging issue to deal with than physical terrorism ,  he told central asia online . 
khan pointed to the distinguished parentage of hamza amin ,  who died while making a bomb . 
his father was dr amin jadoon ;  his mother a former member of the national assembly from jamaat-e-islami . 
i know many people who are al-qaeda sympathisers while belonging to one or another religious party or group ,  khan said . 
prof pervez hoodbhoy ,  a faculty member at qaid-e-azam university islamabad ,  said ,  those who intellectually motivate others to kill those who are not like them are equally responsible  ( for such murders )  . 
in fact ,  they are more dangerous and lethal . 
they create paranoia ,  fear and hatred and generate all kinds of negative emotion resulting in physical terrorism . 
he called for the denial of media platforms and other forums to such agitators . 
khadim hussain ,  a political analyst and researcher ,  said intellectual terrorists have succeeded in seemingly rationalising physical terrorisms place within society ,  such as equating jihad with qittal  ( killing )  - even though they are not the same - and carrying out jihad through privatised militia . 
 ( intellectual terrorists )  construct intellectual discourses that create enemies and hostile entities ,  hussain said . 
for example the word ummah is used in a manner which leads to the clash of civilisation ,  and clash-of-civilisation theory is also floated by  ( the late us professor samuel )  huntington . 
these mentors guide the terrorists organisation on their goals and network among each other . 
it is enticement by exploiting peoples religious sentiments . 
they are continuing to use religion as a tool to achieve their personal policy goals ,  amir told central asia online of such leaders . 
it goes beyond the problems that we are seeing on the surface . 
they are encouraging people to sacrifice their lives in the name of their religion . 
simultaneously ,  this situation is resulting in a lack of tolerance and hatred towards those belonging to religions other than islam . 
citing certain state actors that he considers involved in promoting intolerance ,  he said ,  this is playing with fire ,  which will not serve the state in any way ,  either in the short or the long run . 
so-called intellectuals are busy corrupting the minds of young people and put them on the wrong path ,  said zar ali khan musazai ,  chairman of the pashtun democratic council ,  referring to some former army and intelligence officers ,  journalists and self-proclaimed intellectuals . 
they  ( intellectual terrorists )  have their own nefarious designs and vested interests . 
besides the religiously corrupt intelligentsia ,  university and colleges are also promoting dangerous propaganda against people other than pakistani muslims . 
he said ,  at the  ( pre-college )  level ,  some arabic-language and theology teachers instigate students to wage so-called jihad and fight the non-muslims ,  especially the west ,  the hindus and israel . 
students are taught that pakistani muslims are better than other people and that when doomsday approaches ,  the jihad will start from pakistan and that this country will lead other muslim countries . 
khan told central asia online that the ultimate danger of intellectual terrorism is that it can further divide the nation and provide more resources for physical terrorists . 
it provides the terrorists ground for good recruits ,  he said . 
the government is not giving due attention to fighting the terrorists on the ideological front . 
the provincial minister ,  mian iftikhar ,  disagrees with that criticism of the government . 
when the military operation in malakand against terrorism was successfully completed ,  i said at that time that now we have to break the terrorist mind-set that is still there . 
we will be fighting this intellectual terrorism on every front ,  namely ,  through our curriculum and education system ,  literature ,  speech ,  media and intellectual forums ,  iftikhar said . 
the people who are spreading the propaganda are no friends of pukhtuns or of pakistan . 
they are ruining our youth and our society . 
we will counter this expansion of hate ideology . 
 " the counter-narrative that promotes peace ,  tolerance ,  harmony and peaceful co-existence "  .

karachi finds peace again
the riots reportedly erupted may <num>18</num>  when nabi dad ,  an activist of the awami national party  ( anp )  ,  was killed in shah faisal and someone set the anp office in mehmood abad ablaze . 
some were members of the anp ,  pashtunkhwa milli awami party ,  mutahidda qaumi movement  ( mqm )  and jamaat-e-islami . 
the cause of the violence was not clear ,  but it involved the mqm - a political party of indian migrants - and anp ,  which represents pashtun migrants . 
both parties compete for influence in the city . 
another rift in the city is that between the pashtun and hazara communities . 
the mqm seeks control of karachi while the pakistan peoples party is resisting its plans for hegemony ,  political analyst manaan baacha said . 
on the other hand ,  the anp is emerging as a new political power in the city . 
yes ,  political motives could be involved in the recent targeted killings ,  said provincial interior minister zulfiqar mirza . 
more than <num>200</num>  people have been arrested from different parts of karachi . 
no one will be allowed to destroy the peace of the city . 
but one police officer ,  who spoke on condition of anonymity ,  predicted that officials would be unable to resist pressure from political parties to release their detained members . 
violence has flared up every two or three months in recent years in the town and takes scores of lives ,  but law enforcement agencies are not able to control it ,  the police officer said . 
he also said many members of the land and drug mafia have joined the political parties in karachi and are doing business in the shadow of these parties ,  which is the main reason for the recurring violence . 
human rights commission of pakistan statistics show <num>560</num>  homicides in karachi during the first four months this year ;  <num>148</num>  of the victims were activists of different political and religious parties . 
iqbal haider ,  co-chair of the commission ,  called the targeted killings a tug of war for control over the countrys financial hub . 
the latest trouble pales in comparison to the ethnic and political violence that killed thousands in the <num>1980</num>  second  and <num>1990</num>  second  ,  baacha said . 
karachis civil society organisations and opposition parties criticised the coalition partners in the sindh government for alleged involvement in the violence . 
for the first time in history ,  activists of the ruling parties are being targeted and killed haider said . 
targeted killing incidents ,  which started last year ,  got worse in <num>2010</num>  , and the government and the law enforcement agencies have completely failed to stop them . 
some said the ineffectual official reaction was purposeful . 
the government agencies dont want peace in the city ,  and they have deliberately given a free hand to the mafia to kill innocent people in order to let the law-and-order situation get worse ,  said ishaq khan ,  district leader of jamaat-e-islami . 
khurshid khan ,  deputy attorney general of pakistan ,  has set up a kiosk outside a sikh temple in the dabgari bazaar ,  where he collects worshippers shoes and shines them while their owners pray . 
he performs this act of humility to improve the image of muslims and pakhtuns with the sikh community . 
 [ javed aziz khan ] 
peshawar - a shoe shine stand near the dabgari bazaar serves a unique purpose . 
but khurshid khan ,  deputy attorney general of pakistan ,  does more than store the shoes . 
we appreciate the gesture ,  said worshipper gulab singh . 
khurshid ,  who often wears a yellow headscarf like the sikhs ,  began his mission after kidnappers killed jaspal singh ,  a sikh ,  february <num>20</num>  .
a military operation rescued jaspals two companions . 
around <num>3,000</num>  sikh community members live in peshawar . 
afghan peace jirga concludes ,  invites taliban to talks
the three-day afghan peace jirga ended june <num>4</num>  with an invitation to the taliban to talk to the government . 
no militant groups participated in the jirga . 
 [ abdulhadi hairan ] 
kabul - the three-day afghan peace jirga concluded june <num>4</num>  with a call for afghan president hamid karzais government to take formal steps toward negotiating with the taliban and other islamic militants . 
we are committed to bringing peace and stability to this country . 
he asked the taliban to join hands with the government in order to block foreign conspiracies that are hatched against our country . 
chairmen of all <num>28</num>  jirga committees presented their recommendations for an effective peace process in the country . 
 *  removal of taliban and hizb-e-islami members from un and united states blacklists as a goodwill gesture ; 
 *  immediate release of all afghans who have been arrested for alleged taliban membership or terrorism but have not yet been charged ; 
 *  protection and inclusion within the political system of taliban and hizb-e-islami members willing to join the peace process ; 
 *  formation of a powerful and independent commission with branches in all provinces ,  so insurgents can contact it when they want to do so ; 
 *  widespread government reforms to eliminate corruption and injustice ,  which are major recruiting tools for the insurgency ; 
 *  and co-operation by afghanistans neighbours  ( particularly pakistan and iran and regional powers such as india ,  china ,  russia ,  and fellow islamic countries )  with kabul in its peace plans . 
presidential spokesman waheed omar told media that <num>97</num>  %  of those who received invitations attended the jirga . 
among the participants were officials from all <num>34</num>  provinces of afghanistan . 
although two prominent former taliban officials - mullah wakil ahmad mutwakkil ,  foreign minister during the taliban regime ,  and mullah abdul salam zaeef ,  taliban ambassador to pakistan - did not attend ,  some former taliban members took part in the national discussion . 
some of these former taliban members said the taliban had warned them to be ready for the consequences of participating in the jirga ,  well-informed sources said . 
the taliban delivered the same warning to all participants of the jirga . 
however ,  many said they did not care . 
one participant from an eastern afghan province told central asia online that he was aware of the threats . 
i am not afraid of any taliban attack ;  i work for peace and i have the support of my people in my province ,  he said . 
many of the participants expressed hope that the peace efforts can continue and told central asia online that ,  although many of the recommendations might not be new or practical ,  they still thought it was important for the government ,  international community and insurgent groups to work on them . 
however ,  some attendees and some afghan analysts told central asia online they did not see anything significant in the three-day jirga . 
karzai and many of the speakers simply repeated things they have been saying for more than eight years ,  one participant complained . 
this is an emotional decision ,  said an afghan analyst ,  who declined to be identified . 
it may prove dangerous <abbr>…</abbr>  in the past ,  there were people who were released in such conditions who later proved to be the most dangerous terrorists . 
he had a largely negative view of the jirga ,  he told central asia online . 
pashtuns oppose taliban
nawab ayaz khan jogezai ,  convener of the pashtun ulasi quami jirga ,  tells central asia online in an exclusive interview that pashtuns have suffered from terrorism and oppose the taliban . 
 [ ghani kakar ] 
critics denounce the pashtuns for allegedly supporting insurgents ,  thus making the counter-insurgency more difficult . 
nawab muhammad ayaz khan jogezai ,  leader of the pashtun tribe and the convener of the pashtun ulasi quami jirga ,  talked exclusively with central asia online about some of the negative perceptions of pashtuns as a nation and the struggle to overcome them . 
 ( the misperception occurs )  because these foreign jihadi groups are using pashtun soil for their aims and in the name of jihad and holy war ,  they are creating hurdles to peace ,  jogezai said . 
in his leadership role ,  jogezai said he supports a united and peaceful pakistan ,  and that terrorists and other troublemakers should be dealt with harshly . 
the counter-militancy strategy can be successful in pakistan if foreign militant groups can be targeted and weakened ,  jogezai said . 
one factor strengthening the persistent stereotype that pashtuns back militants is the impression that tribal elders support them . 
but ,  jogezai called that argument wholly a forged claim and said the tribal population has always demonstrated a resolve to oust the militants and re-establish peace and security . 
but here i want to mention that in this strike against terror ,  hundreds of innocent pashtuns lives were also ended ,  which is a matter of great concern ,  he said . 
i must say it is very irresponsible behaviour of those reporters to make such claims without any facts ,  he said . 
it should be clear that if tribal leaders were in such support  ( of the militants )  ,  then balochistan would also be a place for the taliban . 
the media also frequently report that the taliban has an active shura in quetta . 
over and over again ,  this issue has come up ,  jogezai said . 
but there is not any solid information that would make these claims accurate . 
the talibans presence in quetta has dwindled as pakistan has ratcheted up its war on terror in the past few years ,  he said . 
even as terrorism has lost its grip in some places ,  it remains an issue ,  though . 
indeed ,  jogezai said inclusion of the pashtuns in peace talks is something that has been missing from past efforts . 
he hinted that pashtuns suffer discrimination as a minority . 
pashtuns live on land rich in water ,  mineral and natural resources ,  he said . 
but they are deprived of access to these resources and have complete ignorance of the countrys political ,  economic and social decisions and policies ,  jogezai said . 
as a result ,  they are shunted into a life of poverty ,  hunger and misery . 
a joint effort in pakistan and afghanistan will be needed to improve the situation for pashtuns and for both countries ,  he said . 
pashtuns in afghanistan ,  too ,  face a struggle for their rights and status ,  he said . 
but both pakistan and afghanistan are facing the common threat of terrorism ,  and because of this ,   ( we need )  a mutual strategy to eliminate that threat ,  he added . 
besides that ,  though ,  education ,  culture ,  economy ,  language ,  society ,  family and environment all matter ,  jogezai said . 
pashtuns must protect their interests ,  he said . 
islamabad terrorist attack kills <num>8</num>  , destroys dozens of trucks
islamabad - suspected taliban militants killed eight people and wounded ten others as they set fire to an estimated <num>50</num>  or more trucks parked at the tarnol truck terminal outside islamabad june <num>8</num> -<num>9</num>  .
among the many trucks carrying general cargo ,  some were carrying military equipment ,  fuel and supplies for coalition forces in afghanistan . 
police have arrested at least six suspected militants and a case has been registered against unidentified individuals for murder ,  attempted murder and terrorism at the tarnol police station ,  geo news reported . 
the attack began between <num>11</num>  and <num>11</num>  : 30p local time june <num>8</num>  , and eyewitnesses said it went on for more than an hour . 
authorities provided no exact number of destroyed vehicles ,  but truckers put the losses at <num>50</num>  to <num>100</num>  trucks and vehicles being transported on them . 
trucker gul muhammad told central asia online that more than <num>20</num>  insurgents committed the attack . 
they shot at anyone who came their way ,  he said . 
i was sleeping with my colleagues in our truck ,  he said . 
in my sleep i heard a few rounds of gunfire ,  but thought that it might be  ( distant )  . 
but when i saw a truck on fire ,  i alerted the others and we jumped out of the truck and tried to reach a safe area . 
the wreckage of destroyed trucks smoulders the morning after the attack . 
 [ raheel khan ] 
the militants attacked the parking compound from different sides . 
they were carrying kalashnikovs and were indiscriminately firing and guarding other attackers who were holding pistols and long sticks with chemicals and putting the trucks on fire ,  gul said . 
they first fired at men who happened to be in front  ( of them )  . 
they were not trying to scare them ;  in fact ,  they killed them . 
two workers from my area have been killed ,  a few injured . 
most of the truckers informed the owners who informed the police and concerned authorities ,  but their response was very slow ,  a truck terminal worker who did not identify himself said . 
the militants were torching these trucks one by one ,  and they stayed here for more than one and a half hours . 
there was no police in sight for a long time . 
 ( when the )  police and fire brigade reached here ,  very little was left to save or protect . 
the man said he and others had been concerned about security at the terminal . 
and it is now proved . 
road and transportation disruptions due to last weeks cyclone phet caused more truckers than usual to park there . 
delays that occurred in transferring cargo from the karachi trucks to afghanistan-bound vehicles created a target for the militants ,  the terminal employee said . 
kaleem imam ,  inspector general of police ,  islamabad ,  told reporters <num>10</num>  to <num>12</num>  armed men stormed the terminal and all escaped . 
this is the first assault of its kind in the islamabad / rawalpindi area . 
trucks ,  especially those carrying supplies to coalition forces in afghanistan ,  have come under attack in peshawar ,  khyber agency and parts of balochistan .

dushanbe - an agreement between the governments of tajikistan and russia on efforts to combat the illegal trade in drugs and psychotropic substances was signed in dushanbe on <abbr>dec.</abbr> 
<num>3</num>  by chief of the tajik narcotics monitoring agency  ( nma )  rustam nazarov and russian ambassador to tajikistan yuri popov . 
the agreement makes provisions for cooperation between the relevant authorities in both countries to align their policies on drugs and implement coordinated programmes that ,  in addition to efforts to combat the illegal trade in drugs ,  will also include rehabilitation for drug addicts . 
the agreement lays particular emphasis on cooperation in the area of criminal investigations ,  nazarov said ,  where improved officer training is required . 
nazarov revealed that the russian national institute for advanced staff training run by the russian federal ministry of internal affairs has already trained more than <num>50</num>  nma officers who will play an important role in this area . 
the russian ambassador commented that the agreement would enable authorities in both countries to forge closer ties as they attempt to reduce the threat posed by drugs and also to make a positive contribution to international cooperation over efforts to tackle organised drug-related crime ,  which is a source of finance for international terrorism . 
thus far ,  tajikistan and russia have worked together in this field on the basis of a multilateral cis agreement ,  but experts now believe the time has come for closer bilateral agreements . 
tajik and russian law-enforcement agencies are also actively involved in all anti-narcotics programmes of the cis ,  the collective security treaty organisation and the shanghai cooperation organisation . 
since the beginning of <num>2009</num>  , officers of the tajik and russian ministries of internal affairs have carried out eight joint controlled delivery operations ,  resulting in the seizure of a total of <num>84</num>  kilogram  of drugs . 
iran criticizes turkmen-based nuclear monitoring station
the associated press reported that abolfazl zohrehvand ,  an adviser to irans nuclear negotiator ,  told the state news agency irna that ,  with the disclosure of the identity of such stations ,  it clears the activity … is to monitor iran . 
but other international officials say the monitoring station has no motives other than to measure seismic events and that turkmenistan is merely keeping up the diplomatic promises it previously made with the international community . 
annika thunborg ,  a spokesperson for the preparatory commission for the comprehensive -test-ban treaty organization  ( ctbto )  ,  said the test detection site in alibeck is one of <num>340</num>  sites in <num>89</num>  nations used to monitor compliance of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty . 
of the <num>340</num>  monitoring stations that are proposed or already operating ,  <num>120</num>  are stations that monitor seismic waves within the earth to determine potential underground nuclear test detonations . 
alibeck was designated to be a seismic detection location . 
the monitoring stations are an integral element of the treaty ,  thunborg said . 
both turkmenistan and iran are member states and were part of the negotiations for where these monitoring stations would go . 
this station is nothing new . 
kenley butler ,  an executive officer with the center for non-proliferation studies ,  said there is no reason to believe that irans allegations indicate any sort of dispute between its government and that of turkmenistan ,  which borders iran . 
this is simply turkmenistan complying with their obligations as a member of the test ban treaty ,  butler said . 
iran is merely posturing and any complaints by iran of turkmenistan having the station would simply fly in the face of reason . 
butler noted that turkmenistan has signed and ratified the test ban treaty ,  meaning it has vowed not to test any nuclear weapons and will help monitor other nations nuclear testing status . 
butler and thunborg said iran ,  itself ,  has monitoring stations . 
butler said that in addition to its role in monitoring nuclear tests ,  turkmenistan is also providing regional geological support with its station . 
that is a very earthquake-prone region ,  so to have a seismic monitoring station located there will provide more data on seismic events ,  nuclear and non-nuclear ,  he said . 
in <num>1948</num>  , ashgabat ,  which is about kilometres of alibeck ,  was devastated by an earthquake registering <num>7.3</num>  on the richter scale ,  according to ctbtos website . 
almost <num>110,000</num>  people died in the earthquake . 
the disappearance of pashtun art and culture needs government attention
peshawar ,  pakistan -- in some areas of pakistan ,  the arts have faded faster than disappearing ink . 
the five-year rule by the conservative-dominated muttahida majlis-e-amal  ( mma )  and the advent of islamic militancy in early <num>2007</num>  brought cultural activities and performing arts in the north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  of pakistan to a virtual halt . 
it also laid the groundwork for the talibans cultural invasion ,  art promoters and performing artists say . 
there have been no performing arts for the last three years because of militancy-linked threats ,  stage performers khurshid ali and muhammad akbar khan said in mingora ,  a city in the northern swat valley where the taliban have wreaked havoc since early <num>2007</num>  .
the message against the arts is clear . 
female singer ,  shabana ,  was beheaded by the taliban ;  several writers and artists have been kidnapped ;  others have been forced to move to safer places or to seek asylum abroad ;  and hundreds of cd shops have been blown up . 
the result is that many have quit their creative pursuits to avoid being physically eliminated . 
the headquarters of cultural activities in peshawar ,  nishtar hall ,  has yet to stage any art-related show or concert . 
the government minister for arts and culture ,  syed aqil shah ,  cited the threat of militancy ,  despite the fact that a coalition government of liberal pakistan peoples party and the secular awami national party has been ruling the province for almost two years . 
the mma ,  a conglomerate of right-wing islamic parties ,  set the tone for islamization in the province with the closure of the nishtar hall for cultural activities and a ban on music in november <num>2002</num>  .
the conservative-led government ,  in power from <num>2002</num>  to <num>2007</num>  , displaced hundreds of members of the orchestra from dabgari garden ,  removing these artists under the guise of alleged public complaints lodged against them . 
previously ,  the pukhtoon land was renowned for producing great poets like khushal khan khattak ,  rehman baba ,  baba-e-ghazal amir hamza khan shinwari and ghani khan ,  whose poetry kept music tantalizing in the nwfp . 
these poets gave a new lease on life to music in this part of the world and they all focused on beauty . 
tariq jamal ,  president of the artist welfare association  ( awa )  in peshawar ,  stresses the need for special measures to help artists . 
the artists have severely been affected by militancy and the poor security environment ,  he said . 
their economic woes have multiplied and they need special care by the government and other art-loving peoples . 
swat artist khurshid ali ,  <num>38</num>  , said he has worked as a salesman the past three years to feed his family . 
muhammad akbar khan ,  <num>47</num>  , recalled staying at home most of the time because of fear of the taliban . 
the first time he performed in the past three years was august <num>14</num>  , to mark pakistan independence day in post-taliban swat . 
that was a great feeling having been on the stage again to perform after such a long time ,  he said . 
lets fight the insurgency first ,  then we will resume art and cultural activities ,  aqil shah said when asked when art and cultural activities will resume in the province . 
he brushed aside suggestions from the awa that the minister was unwilling to support the organizations efforts to help the artists . 
tajik islamist ,  social-democrat parties ready for elections
dushanbe - two opposition parties held pre-election conferences december <num>19</num>  to select candidates and unveil their platforms ahead of the februrary <num>28</num>  parliamentary elections . 
the islamic renaissance party of tajikistan  ( pirt )  ,  and the social democratic party  ( sdpt )  announced lists of <num>22</num>  candidates for the madjlisi namoyandagon ,  the lower chamber of parliament . 
pirt chairman muhiddin kabiri said his party has grown and expects to do better in the upcoming elections . 
in the last elections ,  we had only <num>20,000</num>  members and we received about <num>10</num>  percent  ( of the vote )  ,  and now our party has <num>35,000</num>  members ,  so we hope the number of votes in the elections will increase by the same number ,  kabiri told central asia online . 
the party currently has two seats in the madjlisi namoyandagon . 
according to kabiri ,  the pirt will campaign on improving the political ,  social-economic and cultural situation in tajikistan . 
he said they will propose a major change in government personnel ,  formation of a new ministry for defending the right of tajik migrant workers ,  and an anti-corruption campaign . 
the social-democratic party of tajikistans  ( sdpt )  list of <num>22</num>  candidates includes former judge batan abdurahmonov ,  former state customs committee chairman makhmudjhon kosimov ,  and nuclear physicist faiz nurmurodov . 
according to spdt party leader rakhmatillo zoyirov ,  the party candidate list could change if individual candidates decide to run in single-representative districts . 
our party has a very good chance to raise itself up through the elections to a significant level and our own tactics . 
but our problem is that the election commission is in the hands of the local executive government ,  and to the extent that they interfere with the voting and engage in falsification ,  the social-democratic party will suffer ,  zoyirov told central asia online . 
the sdpt has yet to win a seat in the parliament since its founding in <num>1998</num>  .
pirt is the only legal islamist party in central asia and began advocating its platform before the collapse of the soviet union ,  resulting in surveillance of leader ,  said abdullo nuri . 
during the civil war ,  pirt was a member of the united tajik opposition . 
in <num>1997</num>  nuri and tajik president emomali rahmon signed a peace agreement . 
nuri died of cancer in <num>2006</num> 
deputies in the <num>63</num> -seat madjlisi namoyandagon are elected for five years . 
elections to the <num>33</num> -seat upper-chamber madjlisi milli take place march <num>25</num>  , with <num>25</num>  deputies elected by local milli ,  and eight appointed by the president . 
there are eight political parties registered in tajikistan . 
the other parties are the communist party ,  the democratic party ,  the socialist party ,  the party of economic reform ,  and the agrarian party . 
christmas in peshawar
younatan yunas ,  yameen khan younatan ,  julia parvez and marriott marry ,  right to left ,  are some of the pakistani christians who will be celebrating christmas . 
the militancy in pakistan ,  particularly peshawar ,  is causing some to tone down celebrations ,  a practice that has spread to all religions as threats of attacks on places of worship have escalated . 
 [ abdullah jan ]  . 
peshawar ,  pakistan -- christians will ring in christmas a little more quietly this year . 
pakistan today is known for the most dreaded terrorist networks and for being a land of intolerance . 
few in the outside world may know that more than <num>3</num>  million christians and other religious minorities live serenely in this majority muslim country . 
christians are the biggest religious minority in pakistan ,  comprising about <num>2</num>  percent of the population . 
religious minorities live in almost every corner of pakistan ,  even the volatile northwestern parts and tribal regions . 
besides christians ,  hindus ,  sikhs ,  buddhists and other religious minorities live with islamic pakistanis ,  forming an excellent example of co-existence among the followers of different faiths . 
i was born a pakistani and am proud to be so ,  said waseem bhatti ,  <num>37</num>  , a pentecostal christian pastor from the northwestern city of peshawar . 
as a christian ,  i enjoy all the freedoms for religious minorities available under the pakistani laws . 
otherwise considered a conservative town ,  peshawar represents religious tolerance . 
a catholic church ,  saint michaels ,  and a faisal mosque have been located next to each other on its mall road for decades . 
there are more than a dozen churches in peshawar . 
hindus and sikhs also have places of worship in the city and elsewhere in pakistan . 
ejaz also visits muslim friends on their religious festivals to share greetings . 
ejaz told central asia online he has never had a problem with his muslim colleagues . 
but this time its an altogether different story ,  said peshawar housewife zanobia robinson ,  referring to the wave of terrorist attacks across pakistan . 
she is planning to celebrate this christmas with less fervour due to threats of attacks on places of worship . 
the pakistani army has launched a massive offensive against the militant outfits in tribal regions since may of this year . 
the operation against the taliban came after a wave of terrorist attacks across pakistan . 
peshawar was the worst-hit town ,  where two dozen bomb blasts have killed more than <num>300</num>  people . 
the entire pakistani nation is confronted with terrorism and so are the christians ,  robinson told central asia online . 
the christian community has decided to celebrate christmas as silent christmas ,  with no outdoor activities and smaller gatherings . 
instead of going for more fervour ,  we should sympathize with those who lost their loved ones in terrorist attacks ,  said waseem ,  who plans to spend christmas visiting families who have lost loved ones to terrorism . 
police records confirm the deaths of at least two christians in bomb blasts in peshawar since october . 
many non-muslims have also been maimed in such attacks . 
rafail bhatti ,  <num>35</num>  , a receptionist at the church of pakistan offices in peshawar said ,  with only two days left i have yet to buy christmas stuff for my kids . 
the father of two said ,  this will be the first time that i wont take my kids outside on christmas day . 
these bomb blasts have scared us ,  said samina ,  whose husband normally hosts a big party at their place on christmas eve . 
this time we are inviting just a few friends and relatives . 
other religious minorities are facing similar problems as they observe religious festivals . 
the entire country is suffering and so are we christians ,  said joseph saleem ,  <num>39</num>  , of peshawar . 
he said he thinks the bad situation will bring the people of pakistan closer together . 
saleem said christians do face problems in a muslim majority society . 
but pakistan is our motherland and all pakistanis are brothers and sisters he said . 
kazakhstan considers doctrine of national unity
president nursultan nazarbayev has proposed a doctrine of national unity that has left his country divided . 
 [ getty images ] 
this doctrine of national unity of kazakhstan is a strange thing . 
about <num>90</num>  percent of those who talk about it probably didnt even read it . 
its like in soviet times - nobody read solzhenitsyn ,  but everybody condemned him . 
it is very complicated ,  nobody really knows what it is about ,  said gulnar nadirova ,  professor of kazakhstan university in the name of al-farabi . 
in a move to further break away from its soviet history ,  kazakhstan is trying to build nationalism in ways that are not currying favor with everybody . 
they may seem like small changes on the surface ,  but they are creating big waves as kazakh nationalists and oppositionists go head-to-head against the government . 
she said its fine to use the kazakh language instead of russian :  i dont know kazakh that much ,  but my granddaughter understands it and can speak it too ,  so she will be fine . 
those who had a place to go ,  left long ago ,  and those who stayed in the country will figure out their way . 
serik ,  <num>32</num>  , who works at a market as a cleaner ,  says he doesnt care about the document :  i care more about earning money so there is enough for food and clothes . 
i think kazakhs need more work to live normally . 
the doctrine of national unity was proposed by president nursultan nazarbayev during the assembly of kazakh people xv session in astana october <num>26</num>  this year . 
the debate about it was temporarily stopped in early december ,  according to a press release distributed by the akymat  ( executive authority )  . 
a number of assembly council members were contacted ,  but none commented . 
the question of being called kazakh or kazakhstani also hearkens to the days of the soviet regime . 
kazakhstani would be used to refer to all citizens of kazakhstan ,  the country ,  as opposed to just the ethnic kazakhs . 
central asia online asked national minorities what they think about the doctrine ,  and nearly all of them said they dont like that only kazakhs are deemed the only nationality embodying the state in the doctrine . 
the ethnic minorities believed that it puts the kazakhs on unequal ground . 
aydos sarym ,  chairman of the altynbek sarsenbayul foundation ,  told central asia online that those who protest the doctrine usually propose their own variants . 
the biggest lack is that the document … does not reflect those deep ,  titanic changes which occur in our society ,  sarym said . 
on december <num>16</num>  about <num>30</num>  people tried to hold a protest at the square of the republic ,  but they were detained by the police and left three hours later . 
a day later about <num>3,000</num>  national-patriotic supporters ,  together with popular kazakh writer and leader of the state language movement mukhtar shakhanov ,  gathered at the square demanding that their opinion be considered . 
shakhanov says he is going to present his version of the doctrine soon :  why did our ancestors defend this land ? 
so that now we are deprived of it ? 
the idea of building the kazakh nation on a state and not ethnical basis is not right . 
according to the state statistics agency ,  <num>15.9</num>  million people live in kazakhstan . 
about <num>65</num>  percent of residents are kazakhs ,  <num>30</num>  percent are slavs . 
there are also uzbeks ,  uyghurs and tatars . 
according to the kazakh constitution ,  russian is the language of cooperation between the nationalities within the state . 
the national minorities of kazakhstan also had their say after the doctrine project was presented . 
the coordination union of the russian associations applied to nazarbayev proposing to create ethnic parties ,  liquidate the current parliament and run a new election with an ethnic basis . 
head of the russian community in kazakhstan yuri bunakov told central asia online ,  this will not cause an ethnic dissociation in the country . 
to build a country which is united and strong - this is a task for all the people of kazakhstan ,  said chairman of the chechen-ingush centre vaynakh akhmed muradov . 
iran ,  tajik presidents meet ,  sign cooperation agreements
dushanbe ,  tajikistan - agreements and protocols on iranian-tajik cooperation in hydroelectric energy ,  geological exploration ,  extradition and completion of the istiqlol tunnel were signed january <num>4</num>  during an official visit by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . 
we support irans peaceful nuclear program ,  which is directed toward the development of the peaceful atom and energy ,  and we support a diplomatic decision to this issue ,  rakhmon told tajik state television . 
the two leaders issued a statement on mutual cooperation between tajikistan and iran . 
agreements were also signed for extradition of suspects between the two countries ,  and an agreement for study of land and geological information systems . 
tajik energy and industry minister gul sherali told journalists the two countries signed a memorandum pledging funding for the completion of the istiqlol tunnel . 
construction of the tunnel was started six years ago ,  but has been stopped a number of times due to a lack of funds . 
a central asia online correspondent reports that iran has signed a number of similar agreements for funding the tunnel in the past . 
a memorandum for a feasibility and economic benefit study for the <num>150</num>  mw ayni hydroelectric dam project was also signed . 
sherali said agreement was also reached to speed up construction of the <num>220</num>  mw sangtuda-2 hydroelectric dam ,  <num>120</num>  kilometers southeast of dushanbe . 
this project will cost us <num>220</num>  $  million ,  of which us <num>180</num>  $  million will be provided by the iranian side . 
rakhmons expressed support for irans nuclear program ,  along with the memorandum for cooperation in geologic exploration and information systems ,  raises questions whether iran may see tajikistan as a potential source of uranium . 
rakhmon has expressed similar support for irans nuclear program in the past . 
tajik president calls dam critical for energy independence
tajik president emomali rakhmon called on families nationwide to support the rogunsk hydroelectric dam ,  which he said is vital to energy security for the country . 
 [ getty images ] 
dushanbe - in a speech broadcast nationwide on all television stations ,  tajikistans president emomali rakhmon called on every family january <num>5</num>  not to remain on the sidelines of the construction of the rogunsk hydroelectric dam . 
the president said that in addition to construction of rogunsk ,  other measures are also being implemented to ensure the countrys energy independence . 
at a cost of more than <num>4</num>  billion somoni  ( us <num>900</num>  $  m )  we are creating a modern energy infrastructure ,  building high voltage transmission lines ,  and carrying out repairs and modernization of electric generating stations built decades ago ,  rakhmon said . 
in the course of <num>18</num>  years of independence we have ,  under difficult conditions ,  achieved peace ,  calm and national unity ,  and have returned to the motherland more than one million of those forced to become refugees ,  he said . 
saying that ,  in the future ,  water will become a serious problem for humanity ,  rakhmon said the country will nonetheless flourish . 
tajikistan ,  regardless of its lack of significant oil and gas resources ,  has endless hydroelectric potential ,  and because of this is one of the leaders in potable water reserves ,  he said . 
but ,  he added ,  despite this huge potential to generate hundreds of billions of kw of electricity a year ,  only <num>5</num>  percent of this national treasure has been harnessed . 
as a result ,  tajiks face electricity shortages during the fall and winter . 
this ,  the president said ,  is a fundamental barrier to economic growth . 
and rogunsk ,  said rakhmon ,  will break down that barrier . 
rogunsk is not just a source of light ,  but a national honor and achievement ,  the power and the strength of the state ,  the main factor for guaranteeing the national and state security of tajikistan ,  he said . 
rakhmon called upon entrepreneurs ,  tajik migrant workers and the entire tajik nation to support the construction of rogun ,  and said that this investment will be valued by future generations as a symbol of self-sacrifice in the name of the development of the motherland . 
but khakimov said the government is funding rogunsk the wrong way . 
khakimov said that according to various estimates ,  the cost for such forced-voluntary acts amount to more than us <num>100</num>  $  m ,  but nothing official has been announced anywhere . 
there is also a downside to forcing people to buy shares in the project . 
such an inappropriate approach magnifies the level of discontent and forms a negative opinion in society . 
at the same time completion of construction of rogun is critically important ,  which will provide not only energy independence to tajikistan ,  but will increase the countrys potential for exports .

in this context we believe that settlement of this conflict should occur in the legal space defined by the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  charter ,  the helsinki final act of the osce ,  and the <num>1966</num>  international pacts on civil and political rights and on economic ,  social ,  and cultural rights ,  the diplomat emphasised .

according to krotov ,  one of the main subjects at the meeting will be a report of a trip taken by a group of cis inter-parliamentary assembly representatives to tskhinvali ,  and an assessment of the humanitarian catastrophe that has occurred as a result of the conflict . 
the humanitarian catastrophe is a theme being sounded in many of the speeches by russian officials and pro-russian political figures abroad . 
the letter noted in particular that the russian side has received with gratitude the communication from the president of the republic of uzbekistan ,  islam karimov ,  who has given the government of the country <num>250,000</num>  $   [ usd ]  to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population that has suffered as a result of the armed conflict in south ossetia . 
central asia not free says freedom house report

kyrgyzstan was downgraded from part free to not free in an annual assessment of freedom around the world . 
 [ photo by joe raedle / getty images ] 
kyrgyzstan has been downgraded in an annual assessment of freedom ,  joining the other central asian countries and afghanistan ,  already designated as not free . 
the assessment ,  contained in freedom in the world <num>2010</num>  :  global erosion of freedom by the non-governmental organization freedom house ,  annually evaluates <num>193</num>  countries based on restrictions on freedom and government oppression . 
calling <num>2009</num>  the year of global declines in freedom for the first time in almost four decades ,  christopher walker ,  director of studies at freedom house said no country showed improvement in the latest assessment . 
freedom house began their annual freedom reports in <num>1972</num>  .
kyrgyzstan was moved from partly free to not free as a result of last years presidential elections ,  walker said . 
the country was right at the edge of partly free ,  but during last year ,  the presidential elections ,  the pressure of the executive powers ,  moved kyrgyzstan to a not free category . 
there were hopes that media freedom will be supported ,  but on the contrary - there has been noticed growing pressure . 
according to the freedom house report ,  pakistan is still partly free ,  but there have been many cases of corruption and violence . 
but walker added that there were still positive signs as the government implements a number of reforms ,  such as restoration of judicial independence . 
walker said there was a noticeable decline in political rights during the nations presidential campaign and election in august . 
the election was marred by allegations of electoral fraud by outside surveyors . 
he said there were also some government corruption cases ,  so the country remains ranked as not free . 
walker said uzbekistan and turkmenistan are among the <num>47</num>  most repressive countries in the world . 
ministers discuss water use and allocation for <num>2010</num> 
shymkent ,  kazakhstan - representatives of kazakhstan ,  uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  turkmenistan and tajikistan wrapped up two days of discussions on water pumping limits and operation of hydroelectric dams on trans-border rivers in the central asian basin january <num>15</num>  .
the 54t meeting of the interstate commission for water coordination commission of central asia brought together water resource ministers to discuss water allocation during the spring <num>2010</num>  growing season ,  the operating area of the narin-sirdapinsk hydro-cascade during the <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  winter inter-vegetal period ,  and measures to improve the environmental situation in the amu darya and syr darya river deltas . 
attendees were reminded that they failed to reach agreement on water use for the first half of the <num>2009</num>  vegetation season in the syr darya river basin . 
facing shortages of gas supplies for generating electricity ,  kyrgyzstan released large amounts of water from the toktogul reservoir to generate electricity during the winter ,  leaving too little water for irrigation in the downstream countries . 
the departure of uzbekistan from the unified energy system has created electricity supply problems for tajikistan ,  which had received up to <num>30</num>  percent of its electricity from uzbekistan during the winter months ,  as well as electricity from turkmenistan transmitted through uzbekistan . 
uzbekistans withdrawal from the electrical system has cut off both uzbek and turkmen electricity to tajikistan ,  orman said . 
this has out pressure on tajikistan to use hydroelectric power throughout the winter . 
tajikistan is insisting on the re-creation of the unified energy system in the central asian region . 
orman said there could be a meeting by the commission in the near future to address that issue . 
to improve the environmental situation in the trans-border river basins ,  the members of the commission have decided to organize associations of water users in the regions . 
meeting attendees agreed to develop a long-term water supply strategy for the central asian republics . 
during the meeting ,  commission participants voiced suggestions and criticisms on the draft agreement between the governments of kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and uzbekistan for use of hydroelectric resources of the syr darya river basin . 
this agreement must become the main legal document regulating the allocation of resources in the syr darya river basin between countries of the central asian region ,  said viktor dukhovny ,  director of the commission research centre . 
it will not only include the rights ,  but will detail the responsibilities of all parties for the rational use ,  protection and development of the natural resources of the syr darya . 
the asian development bank will finance the project . 
the water commission was established in <num>1992</num>  by a treaty signed by the water resource ministers of kazakhstan ,  uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  turkmenistan and tajikistan . 
tajikistan reports to un on rights of children

the un committee on the rights of the child met in geneva to hear how tajikistan is trying to improve the situation for children ,  but many challenges remain . 
 [ maxim marmur / afp / getty images ] 
tajik deputy prime minister rukiya kurbonova told the committee ,  state support for the family and on childrens issues was recognised by the government as the highest priority ,  according to the committee press service . 
kurbonova said a key condition for the development of children is education and that the tajik government is working to ensure that education is provided for all . 
she told the committee that schools allow no corporal punishment and that no schools had recorded any incidents of violence or humiliation inflicted on children by their personnel . 
listing achievements of the tajik government ,  kurbonova said it had cut the maternal mortality rate in half in recent years and that the government had taken steps to improve the conditions of vulnerable children ,  such as those with disabilities . 
however ,  kurbonova acknowledged ,  much work remains undone ,  especially concerning access to quality health and education . 
implementation of these goals has become the responsibility of several ministries through new laws and decrees adopted in recent years ,  she said . 
committee expert dainius puras ,  the rapporteur for the report on tajikistan ,  noted that tajikistan was facing a difficult transition ,  but fortunately the country had had peace for the past <num>10</num>  years . 
puras said ,  the committee would recommend tajikistan substantially strengthen resources and infrastructure for health ,  education and juvenile healthcare and services ;  that it work further to combat violence against children ;  and that it strengthen support for nongovernmental organisations  [ ngos ]  working in the area of child protection ,  according to the committee news service . 
committee experts asked if the tajik commission on the rights of the child can adequately monitor the effectiveness of legislative and other measures involving children and whether a mechanism exists for investigating complaints raised by children or on their behalf . 
they also asked what measures the government was taking to support ngos working for childrens rights . 
other committee concerns included financial allocations for children and protection of children from sexual exploitation ,  fees for birth registration ,  and the recent lowering of the minimum age for marriage to <num>17</num>  .
committee members expressed concern that some young women are involuntarily entering polygamous marriages . 
giesiddin karayev ,  director of nasli navras ,  an ngo that works on childrens issues ,  told central asia online ,  the government of tajikistan is working to improve the situation ,  but problems exist in childrens access to health care and education ,  especially for girls . 
also the use of child labour is a problem . 
child labour ,  especially in the cotton industry ,  remains a problem in tajikistan and in other central asian countries ,  as do early marriages ,  a lack of attention to children and limited educational opportunities . 
tajikistan adopted the convention on the rights of the child in <num>1993</num>  , which requires it to periodically report to the committee on its progress in achieving the conventions goals . 
the committee also wants to see an alternative report on tajikistans performance in these matters ,  which ngos wrote at the uns request . 
kazakhstani foreign minister kanat saudabayev attends an osce meeting in vienna january <num>14</num>  .
kazakhstan has chaired the osce since january <num>1</num>  , <num>2010</num>  .
 [ samuel kubani / afp / getty images ] 
astana -government officials and civil society representatives are finding mixed results in assessing kazakhstans successes and failures five months into its one-year chairmanship of the organisation for security and co-operation in europe  ( osce )  . 
central asia online also interviewed individuals who did not attend the seminars . 
all the commitments kazakhstan made are nothing more than rhetorical devices ,  said institute of political solutions scholar maksim kaznacheyev . 
in exchange for this  ( chairmanship )  ,  we guaranteed the european countries stability in natural-resource contracts . 
the world is not expecting kazakhstan to meet its promises ,  he added . 
kazakhstans democratic practises need considerable work ,  said jeannette kloetzer ,  deputy director of the osce centre in astana . 
but she praised the countrys role as a peacemaker in the april <num>6</num> -<num>8</num>  events in kyrgyzstan . 
we managed to establish conditions under which osce dialogue was effective ,  she said . 
mp kamal burkhanov said kazakhstan had contributed in other foreign locations . 
among the innovations that kazakhstan introduced ,  abdykarimov noted the osces involvement in afghanistan ,  meetings in corfu on european security and the upcoming osce summit that kazakhstan intends to host . 
in the beginning ,  the decision  ( to convene a summit )  was met rather negatively ,  but now that view seems to have changed ,  zellner said . 
what i hear from vienna is that even many western delegations are rather positive about the summit . 
indeed ,  all the european countries have agreed to participate in the osce summit - the first in more than ten years - this autumn ,  kaznacheyev said . 
the summit is an image thing ,  an effort by kazakhstan to assert itself in a european format . 
a date for the summit has yet to be announced . 
however ,  assessments of kazakhstani adherence to promises on democracy and freedom of speech are less rosy . 
in terms of democracy ,  kazakhstan did not make good . 
whereas two journalists celebrated the <num>2009</num>  new year in prison ,  the number had increased to six within a year ,  said tamara kaleyeva ,  president of adil soz ,  an organisation defending freedom of speech . 
she said the government increased the number of criminal-code articles allowing the imprisonment of journalists . 
that extends across society ,  an ngo representative said . 
the situation regarding freedom of assembly ,  freedom of speech and torture <abbr>…</abbr>  in some cases ,  has even worsened ,  said roza akylbekova ,  executive director of the kazakhstan international bureau for human rights and rule of law . 
law enforcement often uses torture and psychological pressure to extract confessions . 
zhaina aidarkhan ,  whose husband - poet and activist aron atabek - received an <num>18</num> -year prison sentence in <num>2007</num>  for inciting disorder that led to the death of a police officer ,  agreed . 
authorities transferred him to a higher-security prison and added two years to his sentence for an article he wrote in his prison cell about nazarbayev ,  she said . 
another condition for osce chairmanship was a multiparty parliament . 
nur-otan remains the only party in parliament five months after kazakhstan became osce chair . 
he predicted that in future elections ,  the government might find a way to seat a party that receives only <num>5</num>  %  of the vote ,  even though the threshold for parliamentary representation is <num>7</num>  %  . 
when the osce chose kazakhstan as the chair ,  it knew that we had a one-party parliament ,  he told central asia online . 
kazakhstans chairmanship of the osce has destroyed many of the stereotypes that exist in europe regarding the cis countries ,  kuanysh sultanov ,  chairman of the senate committee for international relations ,  defence and security ,  said proudly . 
there is still quite a lot of time ahead ,  and we will see later if kazakhstan will manage to fulfil its commitments ,  zellner concluded . 
kazakh weightlifters worth their weight in gold
svetlana podobedova competes at the world weightlifting championships in south korea in november . 
after her success in goyang shes setting her sights on bringing home the gold from the <num>2012</num>  london olympics .

 " i think  [ the team ]  will win at least one gold medal in london ,  maybe even four or more "  ,  she told central asia online in an exclusive interview . 
she lifted a total of <num>292</num>  kg ,  <num>23</num>  kg more than cao lei of china ,  and <num>25</num>  kg more than riksima khurshudyan of armenia . 
after returning from the korean championship ,  podobedova took a short break at home before returning to the weightlifting training center in ushtoba ,  <num>300</num>  km from almaty . 
despite her muscular physique ,  svetlana is a very eloquent speaker ,  a person easy to communicate with ,  but at the same time ,  very goal-oriented . 
naturally ,  the first question was what inspired her to choose such an unfeminine sport as weightlifting . 
when asked about the reason for changing her citizenship and competing for kazakhstan ,  she said that the competition for a spot on the russian team was too tough and unfair ,  as  " moscovites "  are given preferential treatment despite showing moderate results . 
podobedova was sidelined from international competitions for three years in spite of her achievements . 
she missed the beijing olympics despite already being a citizen of kazakhstan . 
however ,  russia blocked her bid to travel to beijing ,  citing a regulation that bars athletes who change citizenship from taking part in the olympics for three years without permission from their home country . 
but aleksei ni is more specific . 
he wants the weightlifting team to capture at least two gold medals . 
explaining his successful bet on foreign-born athletes ,  he said ,   " after the athens olympics ,  it was decided to invite athletes who can set the pace for our girls . 
 "  he noted that the medals earned at the recent world championships along with the two medals won at the beijing olympics ,  were a result of  " our girls trying to be as good as the internationals .  " 
kazakh television viewers remember aleksei ni as he tensely watched the latest competition and reacted passionately to victories . 
he literally jumped onto the male and female athletes ,  giving them kisses . 
hopefully podobedova and the rest of the team will give him ample reason for jumping in london . 
tajik skier prepares for olympics in extreme conditions
 [ vancouver olympic committee ,   ( C )  vanoc / covan ] 
for kudratov ,  the road to vancouver began at an early age . 
my father brought me here  [ the ski centre in safedorak ,  white valley ]  . 
he worked here as the head warehouseman . 
by age <num>12</num>  i began professional mountain skiing ,  recalls the <num>23</num> -year-old tajik master of sport . 
drygin chose to represent tajikistan because of the lack of local competition in the sport . 
but ,  whereas drygin trains at the best ski resorts in his homeland in krasnoyarsk and in germany ,  kurdatov has only had the safedorak centre available to him . 
there is an excellent four-kilometre route . 
even if there is only one  [ route ]  ,  nature has provided everything the slopes need - both for beginners and professionals ,  kudratov said in an interview with central asia online . 
but ,  it is just <abbr>…</abbr>  he boils over ,  no one believes that we  [ students ]  trample this route down with our own feet . 
sometimes ,  there is only enough time to use the route for a day and then on the next day it is again buried in snow . 
training for tajik teenagers is done at a childrens and youth winter sports school ,  which has been in tajikistan as long as safedorak - <num>35</num>  years . 
school director ibodullo kurbonov ,  said neither the centre ,  nor the school has been renovated in the last15 years . 
just to outfit one athlete costs a minimum of us <num>3,000</num>  $   ( <num>13000</num>  tjs )  . 
we simply do not even have electricity ,  said kurbonov . 
the rest of the time ,  the children have to climb the slope on their own . 
how many times can a teenager get up to a height of <num>1,500</num> -<num>2,000</num>  metres ? 
well ,  two times-a well-trained one will be able to cover this distance three times . 
that is the whole exercise . 
kurbonov said that children are not fed at the school ;  they eat at home . 
all <num>85</num>  students live in the villages surrounding the centre . 
among them ,  there is not a single city dweller . 
twenty years ago we taught mostly city kids . 
many of them were girls . 
now ,  only boys from the nearby kishlaks  ( villages )  are on skis . 
there is only one girl-my daughter ,  said kurbonov . 
i was born and raised in the kishlak of safedorak in the township of takob ,  said kudratov . 
all the boys go to this school . 
however ,  most of them ski on homemade skis . 
i am the only one with good equipment . 
in recent years ,  kudratov has won gold medals at all of tajikistans skiing championships . 
he doesnt remember how many medals he has ,  but there is not one international medal among them . 
the safedorak centre has attracted attention from would-be foreign investors who want to buy the ski resort . 
this information reached the president ,  and in <num>2006</num>  he personally visited safedorak . 
afterward ,  two russian designers visited here and drafted a project for a new ,  future centre for us <num>14</num>  $  m  ( <num>61</num>  million tjs )  . 
in march ,  the vancouver olympic committee awarded kudratov and drygin monthly stipends of us <num>1,500</num>  $   ( <num>7500</num>  tjs )  to prepare and participate in the 21st olympic winter games . 
they only receive us <num>300</num>  $   ( <num>1300</num>  tjs )  in their own hands . 
the remainder goes to training or ,  more specifically ,  to participating in international competitions and organising rest and exercise for them to the utmost ,  said kurbonov . 
i had already planned to go to russia to work in the spring . 
i cannot just sit around all the time on my parents backs . 
but ,  then i changed my mind . 
i will perform and then well see ,  said kudratov . 
asked what kind of work he would do in russia ,  the athlete laughed ,  is there any other work for tajik men there besides construction or a loader ? 
skiing has become my life . 
my only wish is to one day raise the flag of tajikistan ,  added the tajik skier . 
kazakhstan to lift grain export ban in midst of new harvest
the price should be so that the current situation with the price of bread does not change upwards . 
if it goes down ,  we will only welcome it ,  he said . 
the price of grain on the domestic market should not fluctuate ,  however if it does fluctuate do not be surprised when we close everything . 
amid the continuing difficulties in the countrys banking and construction sectors following the global credit crunch that hit kazakhstan last august ,  the government is very concerned that rising food prices coupled with other socioeconomic problems may lead to large-scale public discontent . 
the corporation purchased <num>1.2</num>  million tonnes of grain in <num>2007</num>  , including <num>344,000</num>  tonnes for the state reserve . 
according to agreements ,  the akmola region will supply <num>50,000</num>  tonnes of grain and <num>30,000</num>  tonnes of flour to south kazakhstan ,  <num>10,000</num>  tonnes of grain to zhambyl region ,  <num>90,000</num>  tonnes of grain to almaty region and <num>75,000</num>  tonnes of grain and <num>15,000</num>  tonnes of flour to east kazakhstan . 
maria disenova ,  an analyst at the almaty-based institute for economic strategies-central asia ,  believes that farmers are trying to place their output now because of a possible ban on grain exports in future ,  which may push the domestic prices down . 
grain prices will be going down this year because major grain producers ,  such as russia and ukraine ,  have corrected forecasts of their grain harvests upwards ,  disenova added . 
kazakhstan is expected to reap up to <num>16</num>  million-17 million tonnes of grain from the acreage of <num>17</num>  million hectares this year against a bumper harvest of <num>20.1</num>  million tonnes last year . 
it produced <num>16.5</num>  million tonnes of grain in <num>2006</num>  .
the country consumes about <num>9</num>  million tonnes of grain and exports about <num>5</num>  million-5 . 5 million tonnes a year . 
thanks to the record harvest last year ,  kazakhstan exported <num>7</num>  million tonnes of grain before the ban was imposed . 
the government plans to increase annual grain output to <num>25</num>  million tonnes through increasing the acreage of grain by adding <num>2.5</num>  million hectares of fallow land . 
this measure will enable kazakhstan to be among the worlds top <num>5</num>  largest grain exporters .

it was the second disappointment of the day for the kazakh olympic contingent after the womens team failed to reach the finals in the womens cross-country team sprint .

pakistani hockey fans had reason to cheer march <num>2</num>  .
a 67th-minute goal by abdul haseem gave pakistan a much-needed <num>2</num> -<num>1</num>  victory over spain to keep hope alive in the mens hockey world cup in new delhi after pakistan lost its opening match to archrival india . 
the victory gave the pakistani players back the confidence they lost in falling to india . 
it was spains first loss in this world cup after it drubbed south africa <num>4</num> -<num>2</num>  .
departing from its strategy in the previous game ,  pakistan attacked spains defence early from both the left and right flanks ,  with fullbacks backing up the forward line . 
haseem scored off a perfect pass from experienced forward rehman butt . 
pakistan took a <num>1</num> -<num>0</num>  lead into halftime . 
spain attacked early in the second half ,  hoping to tie ,  but pakistani goalkeeper salman akbar did not allow the spanish team to convert any of its five penalty-corners . 
in the 65t minute of the game ,  with only five minutes before the final whistle ,  spains david allegre tied the game . 
pakistani forwards responded with increased pressure ,  scoring with three minutes left when haseem deflected a penalty-corner shot by abbas . 
the team has upcoming clashes with the formidable trio of australia ,  england and holland . 
meanwhile ,  australia stunned india <num>5</num> -<num>2</num>  to record its first points after england surprised the aussies . 
indias chances of qualifying for the semi-finals now depend on how it fares in its remaining matches against england ,  holland and south africa . 
bleak chances for pakistan to reach semi-final
new dehli - a <num>5</num> -<num>2</num>  victory by england march <num>4</num>  likely killed pakistans hopes to reach the semi-finals of the 12t mens hockey world cup in new delhi . 
the win clinched the top position in group b for england with nine points in three matches . 
previously ,  england beat australia <num>3</num> -<num>2</num>  and south korea <num>6</num> -<num>4</num>  .
after being down <num>2</num> -<num>0</num>  in the first half ,  pakistan came from behind to score two goals in the second half . 
a classic goal by shakeel abbasi in the 45t minute and rehan butts deflection off a penalty-corner in 48t minute brought pakistan back into the game . 
in the last three matches ,  sohail scored just one goal . 
englands second goal came from ashley jackson . 
pakistans march <num>4</num>  loss all but eliminates its chances to reach the semi-finals . 
england and australia are sure to top in the group . 
if india wins its remaining three matches and spain does not lose ,  pakistan will not advance .

astana -- silver medal-winning biathlete elena khrustaleva saved her fellow kazakh athletes from humiliation ,  kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said ,  as reported on march <num>5</num>  by novosti-kazakhstan . 
meeting khrustaleva and other notable kazakh women march <num>2</num>  , nazarbayev said ,  elena saved all kazakh athletes from humiliation . 
elena khrustaleva shows off the olympic silver medal she won in vancouver at a press conference in almaty march <num>9</num>  .
 [ timur batyrshin ] 
almaty - central asias lone olympic medalist ,  elena khrustaleva ,  wasnt expecting to win a medal at vancouver . 
i wanted this victory ,  but didnt expect it . 
i knew there were strong competitors and took that into account ,  she told central asia online . 
khrustaleva said her goal was to finish fifth - the minimum required by her contract with kazakhstans olympic committee . 
but khrustaleva beat norways ture begrer by <num>20</num>  seconds to win silver in the womens <num>15</num>  kilometer  individual pursuit biathlon . 
despite her unexpected win ,  the <num>29</num>  year-old says she wasnt surprised . 
i was awfully happy - but not surprised . 
she failed to make the russian olympic team ,  so in <num>2002</num>  , she represented belarus at salt lake city ,  utah ,  where she came in seventh . 
afterward ,  she moved to kazakhstan ,  and last year became a citizen . 
if youre comparing it to russia ,  of course training conditions in kazakhstan are much worse . 
but i had my own advantages . 
i decided to give up more comfortable conditions ,  in part good target ranges and roller tracks ,  but i get an advantage from training in the mountains ,  living in a home environment ,  and eating natural food . 
at the moment good ski-biathlon training centres are being completed in kazakhstan ,  and the training conditions are improving ,  although this is only for the coming years . 
she said winning the silver in vancouver has given her confidence . 
i know that i can do it ,  and will continue training ,  and will go further . 
i dont promise the gold in the future ,  but i will strive to represent the country with honour ,  she said . 
after so many years without a win ,  khrustaleva seems to be enjoying her fame . 
upon her arrival in kazakhstan she was greeted at the airport :  with an orchestra ,  music ,  posters ,  and a tonne of flowers . 
the akim of almaty akim has promised her an apartment . 
there was an official celebratory meeting with the president ,  who said she saved kazakhstan and central asia from humiliation . 
ahead for khrustaleva in <num>2010</num>  is the kazakhstan championship and the petropavlovsk-kamchatsk competition in russia . 
while she is currently the darling of kazakhstan and central asia ,  khrustaleva said her lifes work is to continue training . 
my own demands and those of my leadership have grown . 
so i am going to work harder ,  she said . 
but right now i cant pledge to win everything everywhere .

peshawar ,  pakistan -- pakistani hockey is in tatters . 
chief selector hasan sardar says the country selected the best team that it could . 
but that squad has never fallen as low in world rankings as it has following the 12t mens hockey world cup in india . 
after finishing eighth in the <num>2008</num>  beijing olympics ,  the team expected to improve in new delhi ,  where the worlds <num>12</num>  best teams gathered for the coveted title . 
instead ,  its standing plunged further . 
its match with canada will determine whether pakistan ranks 11t or 12t in the world . 
the team ,  a blend of youth and experience ,  has won just one match - against spain - while losing to india <num>4</num> -<num>1</num>  , england <num>5</num> -<num>2</num>  , south africa <num>4</num> -<num>3</num>  and australia <num>2</num> -<num>1</num>  .
after the loss to south africa ,  which observers had considered one of the world cups weaker entrants ,  coach shahid ali khan said he had never seen the team play so poorly . 
pakistans prowess at its own national sport has been on the decline since it won its last world cup in <num>1994</num>  .
militancy has played a part ,  keeping foreign teams away and depriving the team of opportunity to give new players international exposure . 
former assistant team manager waqar maroof called the teams performance a disaster . 
former olympian rahim khan said either management did not plan well or the team failed to follow the plan properly . 
sardar blamed the senior players for a disappointing show . 
former team coach naveed alam and ex-captain islahuddin siddiqui called for management officials to resign . 
rahim khan also said a coaching change is needed . 
shahid ali khan ,  an ex-olympian ,  was nominally the coach ,  but it looked as if asif bajwa ,  who is secretary of the pakistan hockey federation and also team manager ,  did more coaching . 
bajwa ,  who is an international hockey federation-trained coach ,  would have been a good choice for this important position during such a big tournament ,  rahim khan opined .

another tashkent football team ,  bunyodkor ,  lost a home match to the zob ahan squad of isfahan ,  iran ,  <num>1</num> -<num>0</num>  .
this is the second defeat for the bunyodkor swallows to zob ahan . 
six days earlier in isfahan ,  zob ahan thrashed bunyodkor <num>3</num> -<num>0</num>  .
the second defeat by the isfahan team put bunyodkor in a tough position .

to qualify ,  bunyodkor will have to beat the saudi al-ittihad in the fifth round . 
furthermore ,  two bunyodkor players will be unavailable in the fifth round . 
brazilian-born rivaldo received a red card in the most recent game ,  while anvar gafurov has accumulated two yellow cards . 
however ,  swallows coach luiz felipe scolari said teams shouldn't play with the same lineup all the time . 
 " in our remaining two matches ,  we have to get the maximum result ;  there's no way out "  ,  he said after the game . 
zob ahan coach mansour ebrahimzadeh said everything worked out as planned ,  despite some burdens for the iranians . 
bunyodkor was playing at home and had strong players ,  including foreign-born stars . 
 " thank god ,  success smiled on us today "  ,  he said . 
the champions league leader board after the fourth-round matches shows :

pakistan hopes to perform better in next months azlan shah cup after disappointment in the world cup . 
 [ saeed khan / afp / getty images ] 
peshawar -- newly elevated pakistani field hockey coach khawaja junaid is trying to put the pieces together after his teams dismal performance in the world cup in new delhi last month . 
a fortnight of intensive training began april <num>23</num>  at the hockey club of pakistan stadium in karachi . 
the team intends to regain its pride next month at the sultan azlan shah cup in ipoh ,  malaysia . 
field hockey fans and observers will be watching closely to see how the team responds to its new coachs ideas . 
junaid was coaching the junior team when the pakistan hockey federation  ( phf )  cleared the way for his promotion by firing coach shahid ali khan and team manager asif bajwa . 
he insists that the same team will fare better than average in future international tournaments . 
the entire team quit after its failure in new delhi . 
the phf ,  though ,  might have to retain some of the members ,  since it lacks the young players it needed to reload . 
critics are wondering why anybody should expect a team likely to contain numerous retreads from the world cup to do any better . 
we will be relying again on those players who disappointed the nation in new delhi ,  former team official waqar maroof told central asia online . 
we will not improve our standing . 
new chief selector and former olympian hanif khan named <num>33</num>  probables for the training programme in karachi . 
three players from the world cup team - zeeshan ashraf ,  waseem ahmed and akhtar ali - excused themselves from that programme . 
phf president qasim zia accepted their request for a rest after playing too much hockey . 
but many others involved in the new delhi fiasco are competing for slots on the malaysia-bound team . 
among them is penalty-corner specialist sohail abbas . 
detractors remember that he scored only two goals in the world cup when his team badly needed his firepower . 
his selection will deny a budding junior player a chance to get international exposure ,  waqar argued . 
his poor defence allows rivals to score against pakistan effortlessly . 
the federation has not named the team captain for the may <num>6</num> -<num>16</num>  malaysian tournament . 
management is looking for a captain who can unite the team rather than disunite it "  ,  sources close to the phf told central asia online . 
pakistan might want to try assembling a proper team rather than entering a tournament unprepared ,  critics suggested . 
 " our tragedy is that we first eye a tournament and then prepare a team "  ,  waqar said . 
 " we don't need to eye the asian games in november <abbr>…</abbr>  or the <num>2012</num>  london olympics . 
let's eye the <num>2016</num>  olympics ,  but before this ,  we need to build a strong team "  . 
bunyodkor ,  pakhtakor advance to afc champions league tournament
tashkent -- fc bunyodkor tashkent won its crucial april <num>28</num>  match with fc al-wahda of the united arab emirates april <num>28</num>  .
the <num>4</num> -<num>1</num>  win sends bunyodkor to the round of <num>16</num>  in asian football confederation  ( afc )  champions league play ,  along with fc pakhtakor tashkent . 
al-wahda lost because it changed its lineup for the game ,  bunyodkor head coach luiz felipe scolari said . 
the uae squad was resting key players for a very important local championship ,  he explained . 
al-wahda faces another uae team ,  bani yas ,  may <num>2</num>  .
scolari said al-wahda for still play ( ed )  rather well ,  calling it a a strong team . 
rivaldo scored bunyodkors first goal . 
fellow brazilian ,  denilson ,  scored twice ,  and azizbek haydarov completed the uzbek side's scoring . 
the only al-wahda player to score was talal abdulla ,  who converted a penalty kick . 
two uzbek players- goalkeeper ignati nesterov and denilson - received yellow cards . 
bunyodkor has two weeks to prepare for its first match in the knockout round ,  scolari said after the game . 
the champions league schedule calls for bunyodkor to visit fc al-hilal of saudi arabia on may <num>12</num>  .
scolari also said he has no intention of leaving before his contract expires in <num>2011</num>  .
team management was pleased with the victory ,  a source within fc bunyodkor told central asia online . 
however ,  the issue of scolari's departure could rise again if the team loses that playoff game ,  the source said . 
fc pakhtakor of tashkent advanced to the round of <num>16</num>  in the afc champions league ,  despite losing to fc al-shabab <num>2</num> -<num>1</num>  in riyadh on april <num>27</num>  .
the saudi victory put al-shahab and pakhtakor in first and second place ,  respectively ,  in group <abbr>c.</abbr> 
pakhtakor consequently has to start the knockout round on the road . 
sherzodbek karimov scored pakhtakor's lone goal . 
afghanistan to play for international cricket title for first time
afghan national cricket team captain nawrooz mangle  ( centre )  hoists the championship cup at the icc twenty20  ( t20 )  world cup qualifier february <num>13</num>  in dubai . 
the afghan cricket team will participate in this years icc world t20 for the first time ever . 
 [ farzad lameh ] 
kabul - militancy ,  financial problems and lack of facilities arent stopping the afghan national cricket team . 
afghan cricket gained world attention when they defeated ireland twice in the international cricket council  ( icc )  world cup qualifier in <num>2009</num>  .
they went on to beat scotland ,  the united states and the uae in that qualifier . 
afghanistan lacks a rich sports history because the taliban restricted sports for years . 
indian skipper mahendra singh dhoni warned his teammates not to slip up against the afghans in their opening match in the icc world twenty20  ( t20 )  ,  according to news media . 
he issued that warning even though the afghans have never played in the t20 . 
afghanistan begins competition against india in the west indies may <num>1</num>  , then meets south africa in barbados may <num>5</num>  .
the taliban banned cricket and used kabuls main sports stadium as a stage for public executions ,  but analysts predict that success at the t20 could be a climactic chapter in afghanistans evolving sports history . 
when afghan refugees returned to their homeland ,  the country formed a cricket team that attracted broad support ,  despite a lack of funding and facilities . 
the afghan squad has to play all its matches abroad because it lacks security and facilities . 
afghanistan is competing in group c with india and south africa and needs to defeat one of them to join the super eight of the <num>12</num>  teams playing in the tourney . 
nawrooz mangle ,  <num>25</num>  , will lead the afghan t20 team . 
he took three wickets when afghanistan beat ireland by eight wickets in februarys qualifying final . 
although cricket is a new sport in afghanistan ,  i trust my national teams capabilities and victory ,  saghar rashidi <num>26</num>  , a cricket lover ,  told central asia online . 
its not a matter of strength or weakness . 
australia is the strongest team in the world ,  but it was out of two consecutive t20 world cups ,  said shafiq shaheed ,  an afghan cricket commentator . 
no one can really predict the outcome of the game in the t20 ,  but im sure our heroes will make us proud . 
malaysian tourney seen as learning experience
with the sultan azlan shah cup at stake ,  the pakistani hockey team sees the tournament as an opportunity to rebuild rather than as a chance for a victory . 
 [ iqbal khattak ] 
peshawar - malaysia might be where pakistani field hockey begins the long climb back to glory . 
pakistan aims to use the 19t sultan azlan shah cup as a learning experience for junior players . 
they replaced senior players who disappointed the nation during the mens hockey world cup in new delhi in march . 
in india ,  the team finished a humiliating 12t - last place . 
fans expected such drastic changes after the fiasco in new delhi . 
the chief selector was diplomatic in saying the senior players were being rested ,  former olympians said . 
hanif actually dumped them and they will need to demonstrate top fitness to regain their slots ,  the ex-stars added . 
muhammad imran ,  muhammad irfan ,  muhammad rashid ,  fareed ahmad ,  haseem khan ,  muhammad zubair ,  umar bhutta and muhammad rizwan are among the players retained from the world cup squad . 
goalkeeper imran butt ,  kashif ali ,  zeeshan ali ,  muhammad tauseeq ,  abdul qayyum ,  and kashif ali are making their international debut . 
imran ,  fullback and former vice-captain ,  is the new captain . 
he promised to push the team to play as a unit in the azlan shah cup . 
we <abbr>…</abbr>  request you not to associate too many hopes with us ,  imran said . 
we are only just now recovering from the debacle in the world cup . 
pakistan has won the azlan shah cup only twice - in <num>2000</num>  and <num>2003</num>  .
it views the malaysian tourney as a chance to give junior players experience for more important tournaments :  the asian games in china this november and then the <num>2012</num>  london olympics . 
the underdog pakistani squad will become acquainted with international exposure ,  former olympian rahim khan told central asia online . 
the teams real target is the asian games ,  hanif said . 
the azlan shah cup and commonwealth games  ( in delhi in october )  are just practise events ,  he continued . 
world cup holder australia is the favourite in ipoh ,  while india and south korea will challenge for the crown ,  field hockey observers predicted . 
however ,  the malaysian home team ,  china and egypt might pull out some surprising victories ,  they added . 
<num>157</num>  runs is not enough

australia eventually prevailed . 
peshawar -- pakistan no longer controls its fate in the icc twenty20 world cup ,  after losing to australia by <num>34</num>  runs sunday night . 
the pakistani team now needs a specific scenario of wins and losses by other teams in order to move into the second round of the tournament in the west indies . 
 " it was not a good rally by pakistan "  ,  shaukat ali ,  a shopkeeper in jahangirabad ,  said after the defeat . 
pakistan's hopes vanished after top-order batsman misbahul haq also returned to the dressing room . 
he scored <num>41</num>  runs with the help of two sixes . 
however ,  hard-hitting afridi's departure dashed those hopes . 
earlier ,  australian captain michael clarke won the toss and elected to bat first on a wicket tailored for batting . 
openers shane watson and david warner were key for australia . 
watson made <num>81</num>  off <num>49</num>  balls ,  hitting seven boundaries and four sixes . 
pakistan's chances to play in the second round will depend on the match between australia and afghanistan . 
pakistan will return home if its neighbour ,  playing for the first time in such a major tournament ,  surprises australia .

argentina-greece world cup match to be called by central asian referees
uzbek referee ravshan irmatov participates in training june <num>21</num>  in pretoria . 
 [ shakar saadi ] 
pretoria ,  south africa -- fifa surprised some by choosing ravshan irmatov ,  a little-known referee and one of the youngest at the tournament ,  for one of the world cups most prestigious assignments :  the opening game between south africa and mexico . 
now ,  hes already preparing for his third match as a world cup referee . 
now ,  they will officiate a group b clash between argentina and greece june <num>22</num>  .
argentines journalists asked what irmatov thought of being on the field with some of the worlds best players ,  including lionel messi . 
when i referee a match ,  i dont know who the best player in the world is ,  he said . 
for me all football players are equal ;  all teams are identical . 
the game has rules that i must follow ;  nothing about argentina and greece matters . 
central asia online asked irmatov what it was like to officiate the cups first match . 
for me it was more important to concentrate on my own actions . 
only in this case will the judging be successful . 
he said it was important for the three officials to work together . 
it would have been very difficult for me to achieve this level without ilyasov and kochkorov ,  he said . 
thats why im obligated to share my success with them . 
irmatovs father ,  also a referee ,  taught him to strive for perfection . 
my father always finds fault in my refereering . 
he constantly points out to me that in some episode i was wrong ,  irmatov said . 
i try to explain to him that we cant always take a position where we can clearly see everything that happened . 
on tv ,  everything is easier to see and from different angles ,  too . 
irmatov said that when he referees in central asia ,  he tries to watch matches of teams he is going to officiate so he will know what might require special attention . 
at the world cup ,  a technical observation team has recordings of all the games for officials to watch . 
the pace of the world cup is challenging . 
june <num>22</num>  second  match will be the third in ten days . 
tournament referees have special instructors for physical training and postgame recovery . 
some referees have already been relegated to assistant referee status after making bad calls in the world cup . 
irmatov said he has no idea what will happen after the third match . 
drugs treatment fails to keep pace with addiction
salma baryalai and her <num>40</num> -year-old husband ,  abdullah ,  started using opium seven years ago while living as refugees in iran . 
now ,  the mother of three children is looking forward to getting the help she needs to stop using opium . 
ive been told i am now enrolled and my turn will come in october ,  says salma . 
as i quit using opium ,  ill make my husband quit it too ,  she adds hopefully ,  her eyes sunken and tired . 
they are indirectly becoming addicts ,  she says . 
they feel pain ,  they talk with others about this problem ,  then their experienced friends advise them to take more drugs to feel better ,  she explains . 
since <num>2001</num>  , afghanistans annual poppy production has eclipsed the previous years harvest by a wide margin . 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  state departments annual report on narcotics says the flourishing drugs trade is undermining the fight against the taliban . 
it also warned of a possible increase in heroin overdoses in europe ,  north america ,  central asia and the middle east . 
there are a lot of cases of addiction throughout the country ,  but most addicts are not able to seek treatment ,  zazai says . 
in the last six years ,  many treatment centres for addicts have opened in afghanistan . 
every province in the country has at least one or two treatment or drug reduction centres . 
as the number  [ of addicts ]  is growing - and there are already lots of addicted men and women - we need more centres and bigger centres ! 
we are trying to increase the number again in <num>2009</num>  .
afzali says there are about <num>920,000</num>  addicts in afghanistan ,  with an estimated <num>120,000</num>  of them women . 
afzali says most of these addicts are believed to be refugees who have returned to afghanistan from iran and pakistan in recent years . 
some of the addicts are believed to be victims of drugs trafficking . 
suliman says they welcome addicts interested in starting a normal life ,  declaring ,  i think its a big chance for them to come for treatment . 
there are many treatment centres in the country ,  he explains . 
but the number of addicts is very high and afghanistan needs more centres . 
united nations works to repatriate afghan refugees
the rise of food prices has been a major factor in the decision of thousands of afghan refugees living in pakistan to leave . 
the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  high commissioner for refugees  ( unhcr )  reports they are assisting over <num>1,000</num>  voluntary afghan returns daily . 
last year <num>360,000</num>  afghans living in pakistan returned home . 
with ramadan and the winter approaching ,  we are expecting the number of returnees to slow down for the next few months ,  says baloch . 
while thousands of afghans are willing to return ,  getting them home is not always easy . 
baloch says that escalating violence in nwfp sometimes causes delays . 
the peshawar centre is the area from which the bulk of returnees begin their journey back to afghanistan . 
we have had hundreds of families kept on lockdown in our peshawar centre because rival groups in nwfp were fighting . 
there have been more reports of violence in nwfp in comparison to baluchistan ,  he said . 
this year's total returnees come from all four pakistani provinces . 
today nearly two million registered afghan refugees live in pakistan . 
most come from conflict-affected areas of southern and eastern afghanistan or the drought-affected northern provinces . 
insurgents continue to harm afghan communities
no one has suffered more than innocent afghan civilians . 
after three decades of war ,  insurgents continue to try and stop the rebuilding process and disrupt afghans who are trying to carry on with their day to day lives . 
the insurgents have proved that there are no limits in how far they will go to cause harm or how many innocent people they are willing to kill . 
the talibans most disturbing tactic of using animal carcasses and human corpses to hide bombs has outraged afghan officials . 
according to the nato-led international security assistance force  ( isaf )  ,  more than <num>350</num>  civilians have been killed and <num>800</num>  wounded in taliban attacks this year . 
most victims of these attacks were caught in suicide bombings . 
the afghan interior ministry condemned the explosion and said the tactic shows the weakness of the taliban and its disregard for human beings . 
religious scholars continue to speak out against the taliban ,  saying that abusing and torturing dead bodies ,  whether human or animal ,  is against islam . 
what the taliban is doing with dead bodies is against islamic law ,  said kefayatullah qaneh a mulawi from ministry of hajj and islamic religious affairs . 
islam condemns such brutal action ;  it has no place in our religion ,  he added . 
hanif shah hosaini ,  a member of parliament from khost province who sits in the lower house ,  said :  torturing a dead body is not allowed in islam . 
if somebody does it he is an offender . 
if there is a dead body ,  and you use the corpses to hide bombs or other explosives ,  it is completely against islam and afghan culture . 
in farah province ,  a group of <num>20</num>  suspected taliban militants recently attacked a group of afghan and indian engineers who were repairing a dam for the local people . 
taking a stand against the evil criminal activity ,  <num>150</num>  men from the local village joined police to attack the militants ,  forcing them to run away . 
turkmen universities drop ideological baggage
in the educational establishment of turkmenistan the rukhnama essentially replaced philosophy ,  history ,  social studies and a number of other disciplines . 
the book was declared to be the source of wisdom . 
knowledge of the sacred book was also obligatory for graduates of foreign universities in order for their credentials to be recognised in turkmenistan . 
in <num>2006</num>  , rukhnama was immortalised on gold and silver coins issued on the occasion of the 66t birthday of the turkmenbashi . 
in that same year the turkmen leader decided to acquaint the outside world with his creation by sending more than <num>2,000</num>  copies of the rukhnama to libraries abroad . 
the turkmenbashis work was translated into dozens of foreign languages . 
there were also a number of international scientific conferences on matters concerning studies of the sacred rukhnama . 
the present president has also advanced some of his own innovations ;  last year mr . 
berdymukhammedov ,  who has a medical education ,  was awarded the degree of doctor of medicine and the title of professor . 
it is apropos to note here that the abolition of the mandatory study of the rukhnama still does not mean that a university education in turkmenistan has returned to modern standards . 
the appearance of this new discipline in turkmenistans universities was planned for <num>2008</num>  .
the amendments have also affected the articles concerning the countrys economic development by introducing new concepts and formulations regarding the use of a market economy . 
observers say that despite statements from the authorities about starting a national debate ,  no special interest in political reform has been noticed among the public . 
observers in various fields in turkmenistan note the low levels of activity and poor interest of citizens in the fate of the new constitution . 
in their opinion ,  a period of many years of political stagnation has led people to think that only the authorities make decisions in the country . 
rights and freedoms are declared in the draft but nowhere does it say that these rights and freedoms correspond to the universal declaration of human rights . 
a practicing barrister from ashgabat agrees with this opinion :  the proposed draft is declarative in nature and so i personally have no faith in it .

colombian drug experts train afghan forces
while much of afghanistans northern provinces have been able to successfully combat poppy growth and sway farmers toward growing alternative crops ,  badghis province in north-west afghanistan is a key battleground in the fight against poppy . 
to help the afghan government and the spanish-led provincial reconstruction team based in badghis ,  colombia plans to send expert government officials to the province . 
they will assist both afghan and spanish troops in combating illegal harvests . 
throughout the <num>1970</num>  second  and <num>80</num>  second  ,  colombia had one of the worlds largest illegal drugs trades . 
like afghanistan ,  the country had a large number of militia groups causing violence and destruction . 
colombia drugs traffickers in the <num>1980</num>  second  controlled <num>80</num>  percent of the worlds cocaine . 
but initiatives to strengthen the government and national unity have helped the country battle armed groups and drugs cartels . 
having faced similar challenges to afghanistan ,  colombia continues to lend its support . 
afghanistan has been sending military officers who are part of anti-drugs campaigns to be trained by colombian military . 
and now the colombian military is planning to send their troops to help train both afghan and nato soldiers . 
according to officials from the spanish contingent of the international security assistance force  ( isaf )  led by nato ,  the colombian military experts will be of great assistance in helping to plan out how to effectively combat taliban guerrillas who dominate the northern areas of the province . 
the afghan government wants to have more control ,  but the area is very dangerous to work in because the taliban still dominate ,  said an official from the spanish-led prt in badghis . 
the taliban have been coming from the southern provinces and have been demanding they receive a <num>10</num>  percent profit from the sale of poppy and the people are too scared to confront them ,  added the official . 
since neither the afghan government nor prt has been able to work in these areas ,  the drought has forced many residents of northern badghis to move and find better opportunities elsewhere . 
the situation has become worse and the growing threat has convinced many afghans living in northern badghis that the situation is not going to get better and they are better off leaving ,  said the spanish official . 
new traffic laws aim to block insurgents
the traffic department in balkh province is introducing new regulations for drivers . 
 ( shah marai / afp / getty images ) 
for example ,  cars that are parked on the road and not in a proper parking spaces ,  and those exceeding certain speed limits ,  will be fined <num>3,000</num>  afghanis  ( <num>60</num>  $  usd )  . 
he also said that the new laws will help force drivers to be responsible and improve safety in the city . 
mohammad mosa ,  a resident of mazar-e shari ,  said while he finds it difficult to pay such a fine ,  he supports the new laws . 
bashir ahmad pajhwak a student at law faculty in balkh university believes tickets are the best ways to get local citizens to abide by new laws . 
i am sure people will want to avoid fines and follow the rules . 
one is unlikely to see people breaking the law as long as the rules are enforced ,  added bashir . 
it is not just the traffic department that is creating and enforcing new laws . 
the mazar-e sharif municipality has begun to clear garbage from the streets and close down shops that are not properly disposing of their trash
the traffic department and municipality are running advertisements on local media outlets such as tv ,  radio stations and newspapers throughout the province to ensure that citizens are aware of the new laws .

one cannot fail to notice how expensive back-to-school supplies are . 
by way of example ,  an ordinary satchel costs between <num>120,000</num>  and <num>170,000</num>  manat  ( <num>12</num>  $   [ usd ]  )  . 
there are more expensive satchels ,  but no cheaper ones . 
perhaps that is why trade at school bazaars-even with only a week to go before the beginning of the new school year-did not seem particularly brisk . 
the afghan chamber of commerce in kunduz province is working with americas department of commerce to teach afghan businessmen how to package dried fruits to meet international trade standards . 
more than <num>60</num>  fruit traders from the north attended a three day conference in august where they were taught about international laws and standards ,  the deputy head of the kunduz chamber of commerce ,  haji abdul rasool amiri ,  said . 
an afghan vendor sells dried fruits on a street . 
currently ,  dry fruits from the north are only exported to pakistan ,  india ,  iran and tajikistan because they fail to meet western trade standards ,  mr . 
amiri said . 
in the <num>1960</num>  second  ,  high value horticulture and dried fruit provided afghanistan with almost half of its export revenue . 
afghanistan also provided about <num>60</num>  percent of the worlds dried fruit before the soviets invaded in <num>1979</num>  .
now ,  there is a sense among afghan traders that ,  given the chance ,  they could turn the clock back to a golden period in their countrys dried fruit industry .

containers of dried fruits are lined up for sale at a stall on a street in kabul . 
investment in kunduz province has increased by <num>50</num>  percent this year over last ,  and the number of merchants has risen from <num>200</num>  to <num>3,000</num>  .
but kunduz is not the only success story . 
over the last year ,  kandahar farmers have braved the taliban insurgency to export <num>96,000</num>  $  worth of dried and fresh fruits . 
from dubai ,  the pomegranates reached markets in india ,  the uk ,  canada and singapore . 
in august ,  the ministry of agriculture launched a three-day agricultural fair displaying fresh and dry fruits ,  grains ,  plants ,  animal products and afghan carpets . 
the purpose of holding this exhibition was to find markets for afghanistans agricultural crops ,  and to support the afghan farmers ,  minister ubaid ullah ramin said . 
about <num>60</num>  private sector representatives from america ,  germany ,  turkey ,  tajikistan and india visited the exhibition . 
the ministry plans to hold more trade conferences in the future to find more markets for afghanistans agricultural products . 
kyrgyzstan legalises incomes from shadow economy
after completing these steps ,  the businessperson would need to wait while all materials were transferred to law-enforcement agencies and a criminal case was opened on the basis of the businessperson's own declaration . 
then the taxpayer was expected to willingly go to jail for large-scale evasion of taxes ,  customs duties or payments to the state . 
changes to the <num>2007</num>  amnesty law have revolved around criminal code articles <num>210</num> -<num>213</num>  and tax withholding rates . 
thus the tax rate here is ,  to put it bluntly ,  mere window-dressing ,  "  mokenov explains . 
 " someone who has legalised a million dollars will pay only a thousand . 
the ministry of economic development and trade believes that the largest change in the law relates to privacy of information obtained during the legalisation process . 
 " this information will never be used to prosecute businesses ,  "  mokenov states . 
 " to put it simply ,  nobody will ever ask about the origin of legalised income . 
the law forbids it .  " 
the final stage of the weapons training exercises will involve over <num>1,500</num>  soldiers and more than <num>300</num>  units of armoured vehicles and artillery including tanks ,  grad rocket launchers ,  fighter aircraft and helicopters . 
the scenario for the exercises is that the trainees are supposed to neutralise terrorists at an industrial facility . 
the exercises are being presided over by major-general alexei zavizyon ,  the commander of the 201st russian military base . 
russia and tajikistan are attaching great importance to cooperation through the creation of effective mechanisms for safeguarding security and stability in central asia ,  it was announced at a meeting of the sco heads of state council held at the end of august in dushanbe . 
during the summit the heads of state of both countries expressed their satisfaction with their growing cooperation with regard to counterterrorism ,  the illegal trade in drugs and transborder crime . 
moscow and dushanbe are also cooperating closely both through regional and international bodies and also bilaterally . 
the russian and tajik authorities intend to continue with their active cooperation and coordination efforts regarding these issues ,  according to the newspaper . 
moscow and dushanbe are stepping up their military and technological cooperation ,  writes valery guk in an article entitled russia secures use of aini base . 
officials have revealed that su-25 fighter aircraft ,  mi-24 and mi-8 helicopters and also <num>30</num>  ground and other aviation units will be based there . 
prior to the break-up of the soviet union aini had an aircraft maintenance facility with an airstrip ,  but this later fell into disuse . 
aini is now home to tajikistans air forces . 
it has been agreed that russia will complete construction works on a number of unfinished facilities . 
meanwhile ,  russia is continuing to step up its active military cooperation with tajikistan . 
on his visit to tajikistan president dmitry medvedev was accompanied by russian defence minister anatoly serdyukov . 
development of tajikistan's export potential
aluminium screening
according to kendzhayev ,  this programme plans to balance foreign trade by creating new processors and enhancing the growth in the country's export potential . 
despite the fact that the country's foreign trade is growing substantially each year and the geography of trade with foreign countries is expanding ,  the balance remains negative . 
this means the import of goods exceeds the export of goods . 
aluminium and raw cotton are the chief indicators of tajikistan's export potential . 
according to the first deputy director of the tajik government's customs service ,  negmatboi rakhmatov ,  aluminium makes up nearly <num>75</num>  percent of the republic's export potential ,  ginned cotton accounts for <num>8.1</num>  percent and electricity accounts for <num>3.2</num>  percent . 
consequently ,  the sale of primary aluminium makes up the lion's share of the country's foreign trade . 
local analysts contend this situation could hurt the country when tajikistan joins the world trade organisation unless real steps are taken to accelerate the formation of enterprises that will process local raw materials . 
this primarily pertains to non-ferrous metallurgy and agricultural products . 
the main agricultural product - ginned cotton - is mostly exported in raw form . 
local enterprises process just <num>15</num> -<num>20</num>  percent of the cotton grown in the country . 
according to makhmadsharif khakdodov ,  the deputy minister of energy and industry of tajikistan ,  five textile mills to process cotton will be opened by the end of this year using private capital . 
under the government programme to develop light industry through <num>2015</num>  , several more factories will be built ,  making it possible to process all of the ginned cotton produced in the republic . 
according to the tajikistan committee for investment and management of state property ,  norwegian ,  russian ,  indian ,  and qatari companies are showing keen interest in the republic's aluminium industry . 
the sale of electricity will dominate the country's export potential in the coming years ,  according to the ministry for economic development and trade . 
the commissioning of new large energy capacities will facilitate this . 
moreover ,  tajikistan and its neighbouring countries have signed cooperation agreements in the energy sector ,  specifically to supply electricity from tajikistan to afghanistan ,  pakistan ,  and other countries of southern asia . 
international organisations ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  and the eu are also actively participating in this project . 
pakistan must awaken and fight the terrorists
pakistan is full of contradictions . 
it used to be a moderate and liberal country where people ,  at the time of its formation ,  had aspirations and hope . 
these days ,  in many of the major cities ,  women don their jeans and drive themselves to health clubs and beauty salons . 
there is a lot of socialising too - at home ,  in the restaurants and hotels and at the bazaars . 
the president and prime minister were due to dine at the hotel that night ,  a claim which was later denied . 
whether this was an assassination attempt or a clear warning to the government that the situation cannot continue ,  is irrelevant . 
what matters is that yet again ,  ordinary pakistanis are the real victims of such an attack . 
this is the 11t suicide attack in pakistan this year . 
arabiya television has reported that a group called fedayeen islam  ( partisans of islam )  have claimed responsibility . 
the group has made several demands ,  the main being that pakistan stop co-operation with the united states . 
the authenticity of the tape is still under question . 
but this is yet another group that is playing with the fragile existence of the country . 
al-qaeda and the taliban militants in the federally administered tribal areas  ( fata )  close to the afghan border have also been named by the government of pakistan as culprits who have blood on their hands . 
what matters now is how the people of pakistan move forward . 
ordinary people are coming together ;  in the face of adversity there must be hope ,  and there are signs that it exists . 
sadruddin hashwani ,  the owner of the marriott said he will have the hotel rebuilt and running by december <num>31</num>  .
nariman residents claim kyrgyz police destroyed passports
nariman ,  kyrgyzstan -- police raided an ethnic uzbek village near osh june <num>21</num>  , killing two and prompting allegations of human rights abuses ,  news media reported . 
raiding police beat residents with rifle butts and destroyed their passports ,  saying uzbeks did not deserve kyrgyz citizenship ,  according to some nariman residents . 
citizens who have lost their documents might not be able to vote in the june <num>27</num>  constitutional referendum . 
police came to dismantle barriers that local uzbeks placed on the roads ,  officials said . 
authorities denied that the officers destroyed citizens documents and said they were forced to put down armed resistance . 
the police were seeking to avenge the slaying of their commander in last weeks unrest ,  another activist ,  aziza abdirasulova ,  told media . 
in other news ,  uzbekistan ,  after opening a criminal investigation of the violence in southern kyrgyzstan ,  has begun questioning ethnic uzbek refugees about their ordeal ,  according to the uzbek ngo expert working group . 
the investigators are likely to forward the evidence to kyrgyz counterparts or to an international body for prosecution of suspected murderers or abusers of uzbeks ,  the group said . 
human rights activists such as tashkent-based yelena urlayeva contend the investigators are intimidating refugees and denying them access to independent monitors . 
about <num>35,000</num>  uzbek refugees have returned to kyrgyzstan ,  the kyrgyz border guard press service told central asia online . 
foreign journalists are complaining ,  too ,  that authorities are hindering their work in the south . 
tv viewers can watch only state-owned or nationalised tv channels version of events ,  said an osh resident ,  identified only as nizameddin . 
a planeload of relief supplies arrived in osh june <num>21</num>  , a un press release said . 
at least <num>12</num>  planeloads of aid have arrived in uzbekistan . 
most of the medicine was passed its expiration date upon arrival in osh ,  however ,  media report . 
georgias ministry of health denied that claim . 
the government has also announced plans to build high-rise apartments in osh to prevent future misunderstandings caused by ethnic segregation . 
the buildings will be intended for both uzbeks and kyrgyz ,  acting deputy finance minister arzybek kozhoyev told reporters . 
the osce is sending <num>300</num>  observers to monitor the june <num>27</num>  referendum ,  the organisation announced . 
it also held a half-day workshop in bishkek june <num>22</num>  for <num>20</num>  kyrgyz journalists ,  editors and journalism instructors on covering the referendum . 
province pushes to boost quality health care
neelam jabbar chaudhry ,  punjabs minister for population welfare ,  said that the number of skilled midwives reaching the poor in both rural and urban areas must increase . 
she also said the country is in need of better health education initiatives ,  and that without proper education on preventative care and how to recognise illnesses ,  improved health facilities can only do so much . 
she called on ngos to support the government in running health information campaigns . 
relatives of a pakistani patient push a stretcher through floodwaters to reach a hospital ward in lahore . 
millions in pakistan ,  especially in the rural areas ,  are unaware of preventative healthcare and lack proper medical knowledge to properly diagnose illnesses . 
many street doctors and untrained midwives are misdiagnosing people ,  often causing them more harm than good . 
pakistani health officials have called on ngos to support their efforts by helping to create public awareness campaigns for preventative healthcare in vulnerable areas of the province . 
chaudhry says that disseminating even basic knowledge regarding the proper diet of an expectant mother and other facts on pregnancy could help minimise the maternal and infant mortality rates .

study highlights lack of openness and transparency of tajik authorities
on september <num>8</num>  , the coordinator of the study ,  doctor of philosophy abdulvokhid shamolov said that the aims of the study were to gauge the level of corruption in the country and the potential of state agencies and society to tackle corruption ,  and also to create an environment that is conducive to consolidating an atmosphere of integrity in the country . 
… over the last few years a number of steps have been taken in tajikistan to tackle corruption . 
in particular ,  an anti-corruption law has been passed and a state agency for financial monitoring and the fight against corruption has been created . 
despite that ,  the scale of corruption continues to threaten the development of the stability of the state . 
civil servants at all levels have created a system governed by bribery and other illegal acts against citizens . 
for this reason we have made recommendations to increase the transparency and accountability of state bodies and make civil servants more accountable ,  shamolov said . 
meanwhile ,  as shamolov points out ,  efforts to tackle corruption are viewed by the public with a sceptical eye . 
a survey of civil servants showed that only <num>40</num>  percent are aware of the existence of the code of ethics for civil servants . 
in order to strengthen efforts to tackle corruption in the country ,  in addition to legislative and financial measures covering pay raises ,  improving the efficiency of financial institutions ,  increasing public trust in banks ,  cutting taxes and simplifying business registration and licensing ,  the strategic research centre and undp report asserts that it is necessary to create an anticorruption coordinating council under the command of the president and anticorruption ngos . 
the president of tajikistan is concerned about the food crisis
the president of tajikistan is concerned about the food crisis
the world food crisis has touched two out of three families of tajikistan . 
the president of the central asian republic ,  emomali rakhmon ,  announced this in his address to the 63rd session of the <abbr>u.n.</abbr> s general assembly . 
according to him ,  because of rapid rises in prices for food and utilities the achievement of millennium development goals has become problematic . 
the food crisis has had the most negative impact on the poorest segments of the population . 
in tajikistan where <num>93</num>  percent of the territory is mountainous and only <num>7</num>  percent of the land can be cultivated ,  the crisis has touched two thirds of families . 
it is necessary to undertake additional joint efforts and effective measures in order to prevent further aggravation of the situation with the worlds food supply . 
under these conditions ,  the use of food for the production of bio-fuel appears to be anti-humanitarian and immoral ,  he stated . 
we also expect that ,  to an increasing degree ,  official international aid will be sent for the development of agriculture and artificial trade barriers will finally be removed ,  said rakhmon . 
adding that ,  it is completely obvious that the un must play a decisive role in overcoming the food crisis through an urgent change to the world agricultural policy . 
in rakhmons opinion the leading countries of the world must approach the world financial ,  food and energy crises in a more responsible manner ,  especially with respect to the poor and developing states where the disastrous results of these phenomena are more sharply felt .

masimovs report to parliament during government hour ,  focused on the raging global financial crisis . 
after listing the stabilisation measures the government has already implemented ,  the prime minister talked about new steps in this area . 
the purpose of the draft law is to hold the large shareholders of financial organisations responsible for making the organisation insolvent ,  and define the procedure by which the state can acquire the authorised shares of a bank in the event its financial situation deteriorates . 
the prime minister also discussed fuel problems . 
he said that the state has already obtained controlling interest of atyrau and shymkent ,  two of the countrys three oil refineries ,  and the situation with the pavlodar refinery will be determined in the next couple of weeks . 
all three existing refineries will be under state control to some extent … to ensure stability in our society ,  he promised . 
masimov also announced the planned reform of the customs control system . 
a draft law on that has already been submitted to parliament .

afghan refugees flee pakistan violence
islamabad ,  october <num>8</num>  - an ongoing military crackdown on islamic extremism in pakistans bajaur tribal agency has forced many families to move to the relative safety of kabul ,  and to afghanistans north-eastern kunar province ,  the afghan refugee ministry said earlier this month . 
pakistans army says it has killed about <num>1,000</num>  militants and wounded more than <num>2,000</num>  during the crackdown ,  which was launched in august . 
kunars provincial governor said he would send food and medical aid to the refugees who had escaped the fighting and fled to his province ,  which is located on the border . 
pakistani refugees who have sought refuge in kabul say they have received no aid from the government despite similar promises of food and medicine . 
the afghan defence ministry said pakistans crack-down on rebel fighters in its tribal areas had reduced the soaring levels of violence seen in recent months inside afghanistan . 
meeting of leaders of eurasec member states held in kyrgyzstan
participants also reviewed measures not implemented during the <num>2003</num> -<num>2007</num>  period related to the creation of an energy market and transport union ,  cooperation regarding the non-financial sector of the economy ,  food safety ,  social and humanitarian issues ,  migration policy ,  and efforts to improve the way eurasec is run .

kyrgyzstan prepares for referendum
bishkek - the interim government of kyrgyzstan plans to hold a june <num>27</num>  referendum despite concerns about low turnout ,  and safety in some areas . 
the main reason for the bloody events was the lack of laws and legitimate authority . 
voters will decide on a new constitution ,  the appointment of roza otunbayeva to the presidency until january <num>1</num>  , <num>2012</num>  , and the replacement of the constitutional court with a constitutional chamber of the supreme court ,  central election commission  ( cec )  acting chairman akylbek seriyev said . 
the planned referendum compels citizens to cast a single yes-or-no vote on all three measures . 
interim government officials warned of potential violence during the vote . 
we know for a fact that destructive forces are preparing a coup ,  acting deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev said . 
a transfer of forces from the countrys south is under way . 
kyrgyz outside the government have also voiced concerns . 
weve had a lot of rumours here at the market ,  said aigul ,  a bishkek resident who sells vegetables . 
she plans to stay home june <num>27</num>  .
the interior ministry and volunteer patrols are charged with ensuring security ,  but such small forces cannot prevent potential provocations ,  said asanbek ,  a patrol member . 
they simply shot the patrol members  ( in dzhalal-abad )  ,  and we still dont know who did it ,  he said . 
patrols can stand up to looters but not to armed fighters . 
other obstacles also portend a poor turnout . 
we are having problems arranging polling stations ,  osh mayor melis myrzakmatov said . 
many buildings were damaged ,  but we are setting up stations in undamaged buildings . 
we are working through the possibility of having people not necessarily vote according to their registered residence but by simply showing their passport ,  a cec source said . 
some non-governmental organisations have asked otunbayeva to help refugees recover their documents ,  but many voters might lack motivation to cast ballots . 
i do not see a desire to vote in the refugees ,  nor in most southerners for that matter ,  special interim government representative on refugee matters in the south aigul ryskulova said . 
a low turnout could compromise the legitimacy of the referendum . 
the refugees need to return so that the vote is more legitimate ,  acting justice minister aida salyanova said . 
every citizen should have the opportunity to vote . 
the interim government decreed that the referendum will take place even if a state of emergency prevails in individual oblasts . 
the vote will proceed as long as the voting oblasts represent at least <num>50</num>  %  of the countrys total population . 
decreeing there is no minimum turnout for the referendum was quite timely ,  political scientist jolbors jorobekov said . 
even if one person votes ,  it will be declared valid . 
such a strategy ensures the interim government against a failed turnout in the south . 
the referendum must proceed ,  acting deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev said . 
any serious conflict in the country will turn into war on a regional scale . 
some have called for a postponement of the vote . 
i requested the referendum be postponed ,  saying that it will only catalyse new riots ,  interim coordinator for social issues in the south elmira ibraimova said . 
the south needs to find its relatives corpses and bury the dead . 
holding the vote in this situation ,   ( the government )  is betraying its own people . 
the osce withdrew <num>300</num>  short-term observers from the country for security reasons ,  leaving only <num>90</num>  members of the mission ,  cec member guliya alynbekova said . 
some plan to monitor the vote . 
the osce sends such limited referendum observation teams to avoid validating referendums taking place under conditions that do not permit free and fair voting ,  eurasianet reported . 
a total of <num>108</num>  accredited observers from seven international organisations will monitor the referendum ,  the cec said . 
the new constitution is not worth possible bloodshed ,  said former security council secretary miroslav niyazov . 
this is fetishism ,  he said . 
for the sake of a piece of paper ,  we are ready to cause a massacre in bishkek . 
others have resigned themselves to the situation . 
bishkek resident mirza abdyldayev said he will support the referendum even though he lacks enthusiasm about the government and knows little about the draft constitution . 
electoral fraud has become commonplace for us during the <num>20</num>  years of independence ,  abdyldayev said . 
the previous authorities did all they could to kill faith in honest elections . 
you cannot change everything in two months .

kazakhstan renews dialogue on cooperation in asia
the dialogue was started in <num>2000</num>  and brings together asian and middle eastern nations in an intergovernmental forum for consultation ,  decision-making ,  and practical implementation of consensus agreements relating to political and economic cooperation . 
the underlying idea of the dialogue is to raise asias profile on the world arena so that this region is viewed as a tight-knit community that uses its authority to encourage global development ,  kazakhstans foreign affairs minister marat tazhin said in his opening remarks .

the ministers' discussions centered on furthering pan-asian cooperation ,  including issues relating to energy ,  food ,  security ,  transportation ,  finance and it development .

 " in light of the dynamic growth of the banking and finance sectors in kazakhstan ,  we plan to renew the dialogue's work on creating an asian securities market through such instruments as a regional financial centre ,  "  tazhin said .

press day celebrated in kyrgyzstan
bishkek-kyrgyzstan marked press and information day on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>7</num>  .
in conveying his good wishes to journalists ,  president bakiyev vowed to do everything in his power to promote freedom of speech . 
he also presented prizes and certificates to honoured journalists ,  most of whom are employees of government publications . 
kyrgyz human rights and media organisations ,  however ,  believe the situation with regard to freedom of speech has been steadily worsening over the last two years ,  said ilim karypbekov ,  head of the institute of media representatives . 
no laws have been passed to provide legal safeguards for journalists . 
on the contrary ,  a number of legal regulations severely curtailing the activity of the mass media have been adopted . 
in <num>2007</num>  , more than <num>30</num>  attacks on media representatives were recorded . 
according to karypbekov ,  the number of actual attacks was greater but many journalists who have been physically assaulted do not file reports with the police because they regard such action as futile . 
elena voronina ,  a representative of the public chamber for mass media issues ,  claimed that a new clampdown on journalists is beginning in kyrgyzstan . 
were very pessimistic . 
everything that is happening now indicates that a new crackdown is beginning on the press ,  and on the expression of independent alternative opinions . 
commenting on freedom of speech in kyrgyzstan ,  the head of the central asian association of independent media ,  rozlana taukina ,  said that by comparison with the other republics in the region ,  kyrgyzstan appears to be doing relatively well ,  but the situation is changing for the worse .

kabul - a new railway line linking iran with the afghan city of herat is almost two thirds complete ,  the ministry of public works reported last month . 
the khawaf-herat railway is expected to be completed by the end of the year and officials hope the track will boost trade between the two countries . 
the public works ministry said it planned to build more railway lines to meet the growing demand for transportation links between afghanistan and its neighbours ,  who use afghanistan as a transit route for the shipment of goods to other parts of the region . 
deputy minister for public works rasooli said ,  after the completion of road construction throughout the country ,  and with the increase of transported goods ,  we are now turning our attention to railroad construction in the country . 
we plan to connect our borders with our neighbouring countries via rail . 
the ministry claims that shipping goods by rail costs only one-fifth as much as transporting goods by road . 
the construction of one kilometre of railway in afghanistan ,  however ,  costs about <num>2</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  ,  the ministry added . 
at that rate ,  a planned railway line between herat and tajikistan will cost about <num>4</num>  $  billion . 
the ministry said the construction of railways between afghanistan and its neighbours would speed up the flow of goods across the countrys borders .

i pay the same amount of money in taxes ,  but power and water outages have had a real impact on my quality of life . 
minister ashraf said the government is devising a plan that will protect industries in pakistan and help them stay competitive in the international market . 
when the new government took over ,  pakistans electric power company  ( pepco )  had a deficit of <num>185</num>  billion rupees  [ <num>2.3</num>  $  billion usd ]  . 
but ,  the government has already helped cut the deficit by <num>65</num>  billion rupees ,  says the minister . 
the government plans to cover the remaining deficit with tax hikes . 
that issue is currently under review to ensure that its impact will not impose a massive burden on poorer families and the industrial sector . 
the minister added that an increase in water releases from dams to generate electrical power has helped to reduce load shedding and power outages in some areas . 
day of kazakhstan at eurasian teleforum
 " a programme has been adopted in kazakhstan to implement a digital television format ,  "  said erlan bayzhanov ,  the director of arna-media at a press conference . 
 " and if the kazakhstanis plans come to fruition ,  it will become the first country of the former soviet union to completely digitalise its television system .  " 
islamabad - the talibans hijacking of vehicles carrying nato supplies along the peshawar-torkham highway has led pakistani observers to argue that islamabads authority over its frontier territories is tenuous at best ,  and raises concerns about its security force capabilities . 
while pakistan continues to defend its sovereignty from foreign interference ,  the hijacking reinforces the fact that pakistans security forces alone cannot stamp out insurgency or foreign intervention and enforce the rule of law over all of its territory . 
the current pakistan administration had been warned about the increase in taliban activity in the region and that greater security was needed there . 
of considerable concern now is that the successful taliban hijacking could inspire copycats . 
experts are worried that a lack of coordination among pakistani authorities is allowing the taliban to act freely within pakistans borders and seriously compromise its sovereignty . 
there is no agreement among pakistanis today on whether or not the taliban pose a threat to our state and society ,  said dr rasul basksh rais ,  professor of political science at the lahore university of management sciences ,  in a daily times report . 
this creates a dangerous disconnect between the security forces battling against militants in the tribal areas and a section of society that believes the taliban insurgency to be legitimate ,  he added .

tajik capital parts with soviet era monuments
the dzerzhinsky monument was dismantled because the square in front of the interior ministry and state committee for national security is being reconstructed . 
the latest soviet era monuments to be dismantled follow a number of others in post-soviet tajikistan .

along with monuments to the communist era ,  tajikistan is also eliminating old soviet names . 
in <num>2006</num>  , the names of the highest peaks in the pamir mountains were changed by government resolution from lenin peak to independence peak ,  and revolution peak was renamed after abu ali ibn sina ,  the famous medieval doctor ,  philosopher and founder of tajik-persian poetry known as avitsenna .

kazakh government offers to share in economic losses
large construction projects in almaty and astana have ground to a halt due to the financial crisis . 
 ( photo by sean gallup / getty images ) 
kazakhstan - in a speech at the council of foreign investors earlier this month in almaty ,  kazakh prime minister karim masimov announced that the cabinet plans to resolve the biggest problem affecting bank loan portfolios ,  namely loans that were made for purchases of property and land which have lost one-half to two-thirds of their value since august <num>2007</num>  .
with these problems not yet resolved ,  the government has offered to cover some of the losses so that unfinished construction projects can be completed and sold at fair prices ,  about <num>800</num>  $  per square metre in astana and <num>1,000</num>  $  or higher in almaty . 
these are the prices the samruk-kazyna national welfare fund will pay to acquire <num>1,350</num>  flats in astana and <num>500</num>  in almaty in a bid to stimulate the property market . 
the government is also planning to use the funds resources to recapitalise the banking system in order to stimulate a new mortgage programme offering affordable prices . 
aleksandr kalinin ,  an association of kazakh property valuers council member ,  believes that banks caused the current crisis by ploughing more than half of their assets into construction ,  which artificially inflated property prices . 
he argues that with their collateral assets tied up in commercial and residential land and properties ,  the prices of which are falling ,  they are left with inadequate liquidity . 
previous reports indicated that the country planned to join the wto either this year or next . 
other requirements still unresolved include the five-year transitional period for foreign banks and insurance companies to open affiliates in other member countries . 
kazakhstan is concerned about developing appropriate legislation and preparing its financial system for competition with foreign companies before joining the wto . 
kazakhstan also insists that foreign companies providing services in the energy ,  transport ,  construction ,  auditing ,  and trade sectors register as subsidiaries ,  rather than as foreign affiliates as is required by wto regulations .

dushanbe - tajikistan's cotton harvest may have fallen well short of its target in <num>2008</num>  , but in at least one district in the central asian nation potatoes are doing very well . 
however ,  officials at the ministry of agriculture in dushanbe insist they will keep growing  " white gold "   ( cotton )  at the expense of potatoes and other edible crops . 
currently ,  the nation is heavily reliant on food imports and international assistance . 
in some areas ,  the output of potatoes has quadrupled since <num>2001</num>  .
the tavildara district is one such area that reported a bumper potato crop this year . 
 " the district has produced <num>9,557</num>  tons of potatoes ,  "  said ahliddin karimov ,  an official with the district administration . 
cotton remains tajikistan's premier crop ,  but bad weather and other factors have resulted in a raw cotton harvest of only <num>249,022</num>  tons ,  just <num>63.2</num>  percent of the government's target .

tajikistan - individuals and companies wishing to legalise undeclared property in tajikistan have been granted yet another extension to do so under the current amnesty law .

parviz mullodzhanov ,  a political analyst ,  believes that the amnesty extension is unlikely to push government bureaucrats to legalise their illicit gains ,  since declaring their income and property would be tantamount to exposing their corruption to the public . 
the current law ,  amnesty for individuals and companies legalising property ,  was adopted on may <num>16</num>  , <num>2007</num>  , with the goal of bringing gray assets into the real economy ,  identifying the property rights of actual owners ,  improving the country's investment climate and encouraging entrepreneurship .

tajikistan - in december ,  the global fund to fight aids ,  tuberculosis and malaria transferred a new laboratory for diagnosing hiv infection among prisoners to the correctional affairs directorate  ( uid )  of the tajikistan ministry of justice . 
the laboratory will make it possible to diagnose hiv in a timely manner through immunoenzymatic analysis and to provide the prisoners with the necessary treatment ,  said zulfiya bakhtibekova ,  the tajik representative of the global fund of the un development programme  ( undp )  . 
in <num>2005</num>  , the global fund opened an office for the prevention and treatment of aids in tajikistans prisons to provide prisoners with medical consultations ,  free condoms and treatment . 
the small room in the prison medical unit is called the friendly office . 
for prisoners this is practically the only place where they can talk without the presence of prison wardens . 
in <num>2007</num>  , more than a thousand people with a serious form of tuberculosis and <num>115</num>  hiv-positive people were serving time in tajik prisons .

jafarov says that <num>80</num>  percent of cases are due to failure to seek medical treatment in time . 
the problem is being made worse by the fact that healthcare facilities do not receive enough funding to purchase gamma globulin and rabies vaccines ,  among other treatments . 
furthermore ,  the lack of a national agency to catch and destroy stray animals has led to a rise in their numbers across the country . 
while in <num>2001</num>  the ministry of health recorded only around <num>8,000</num>  cases of bites by stray dogs ,  including <num>660</num>  cases in dushanbe ,  in <num>2002</num>  the figure exceeded <num>10,000</num>  .

shadow economy makes up half of kyrgyzstans gdp

experts believe the growth of unregistered home businesses and keeping double books is responsible for the increase in the shadow economy .

independent experts believe the shadow economy is actually larger than official figures indicate and may constitute more than half of the countrys gdp . 
national statistics committee experts believe the growth of home businesses in the country is responsible for the increase in the shadow economy ,  although they accounted for just <num>12</num>  percent of gdp in <num>2008</num>  .
trade and the repair of cars ,  household and personal items also constitute a significant amount of shadow business accounting for <num>14.3</num>  percent of gdp . 
high taxes have caused many small and medium-size enterprises that provide <num>30</num>  to <num>40</num>  percent of gdp to maintain two sets of accounting records . 
authorities tried in <num>2008</num>  to legalise light industry ,  starting with nearly <num>3,000</num>  underground garment factories ,  but did not succeed fully in drawing them out of the shadow economy . 
government experts point to a loss of trust and loyalty by businesses toward state institutions combined with a decline in taxpayer ethics . 
shadow businesses have come to be considered a normal part of life in kyrgyzstan . 
in fact ,  not a single corruption case has been heard in kyrgyzstan since it gained independence <num>18</num>  years ago . 
authorities are pinning hopes on new laws and programmes ,  but the law on amnesty to legalise cash ,  personal property ,  and real estate signed by the president in <num>2007</num>  has failed thus far to have the desired effect . 
nonetheless ,  the government remains optimistic because the law will remain in effect until <num>2010</num>  and has not yet been fully implemented .

yet this is the first step in a training programme that will turn the dogs into highly skilled mine detectors . 
dogs have been used to trace mines in afghanistan since <num>1988</num>  .
the mine detection and dog centre  ( mdc )  afghanistan started back then as a tiny operation with just <num>14</num>  dogs donated from thailand and a trainer from the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> 
but over the past two decades the organisation has grown steadily into a large organisation that has more than <num>300</num>  dogs working or being trained to work in the field . 
when the organisation started out it was permitted only to support other demining organisations in their work . 
since <num>1989</num>  , the mine action programme for afghanistan  ( mapa )  has cleared more than <num>1.3</num>  billion square meters of land ,  and more than <num>300,000</num>  anti-personnel mines have been found and destroyed . 
however ,  afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world . 
they can clear an area eight times faster than humans can . 
they can also sniff out plastic mines that cannot be discovered by metal detectors . 
initially ,  mine dogs were imported from germany and holland but now all the puppies are bred in afghanistan . 
the first stage of training is socialisation or familiarising the dogs with humans and vehicles and assessing their aptitude for working as mine dogs . 
after seven months of socialisation training ,  the dogs progress to the next stage of their schooling :  ball training . 
the dogs learn to love chasing and playing with the ball as a reward for good behaviour . 
at this stage ,  if any dog shows a lack of interest in the ball ,  then the animal is sent off to be retrained as a guard dog or is given away as a pet . 
the dogs have to be eager to do anything their instructor commands them to get to play with the ball . 
this initial training lasts four months . 
the last two months of the programme is devoted to explosives training . 
the dog learns to recognise the smell of explosives . 
they are taught to walk in straight lines up and down a site and to sit immediately on picking up the smell of an explosive . 
that way their handler can place a red stone on the spot the dog has sat . 
in the evening ,  controlled explosions are carried out to destroy the mine . 
many afghans may see it as an unusual choice for young men to work with dogs as these are animals not greatly liked in afghan culture . 
but the handlers soon come to love their dogs . 
most dogs have a working life of about eight years . 
mdc has a very good safely record . 
in the past seven years the organisation has had no accidents directly as a result of its demining work . 
sadly ,  however ,  handlers have been killed in the course of their duties . 
last year ,  three mdc employees were shot dead by unidentified gunmen in kandahar province
as well as the headquarters in kabul ,  mdc has five substations in qargha  ( to the northwest of kabul )  ,  jalalabad ,  gardez ,  mazar-e sharif and kunduz with a total of <num>32</num>  mine dog teams . 
because of the deteriorating security conditions handlers and their dogs no longer work in kandahar . 
afghanistan is committed to being mine-free by <num>2013</num>  .

masimov said that he reads all messages personally and tries to answer as many questions as he can . 
im ready to enter into virtual dialogue . 
please write ,  make suggestions and discuss things ! 
the prime ministers blog is currently in russian ,  but a kazakh version is likely to be launched in the near future . 
in <num>2006</num>  and <num>2007</num>  , masimov was the only kazakh politician to have a personal website . 
according to research by independent firm ict-marketing ,  the number of kazakh internet users was set to reach <num>2.3</num>  million people or <num>14.8</num>  percent of the population by the end of december <num>2008</num>  .
the mass transition to high-speed internet has been accompanied by a change in user habits . 
whereas in the past people mainly used the internet for browsing and e-mailing ,  <num>2008</num>  saw a growth in the number of surfers who downloaded music and video clips ,  participated in chat forums ,  used the instant messaging platform icq and similar programmes and played online games . 
the average cost of home internet access in kazakhstan is between us$30 and <num>40</num>  $  a month .

kyrgyzstan - the kyrgyzstan government ,  on the eve of the new year ,  decided that energy company stock will be sold in a single packet in the first half of <num>2009</num>  .
the coalition for democracy and civil society ,  an influential social organisation ,  criticised the government for its attempt to resolve energy sector problems in this manner and organised a petition against the sale of strategically important facilities . 
top-level officials claim that a lack of water is the cause of the energy crisis . 
however ,  academician duishon mamatkanov ,  the director of the institute of water resources and hydraulic power of the kyrgyzstan national academy of sciences ,  believes that the real problem lies in the irrational use of hydraulic power resources . 
criminal offenders with epaulets
according to khayrullo gafurov ,  docent of the department of judicial law and prosecutorial oversight of the law school of tajik national university ,  who spoke at a human rights conference in dushanbe last november ,  over nine months in <num>2008</num>  nine cases concerning the torture of detainees by police were examined by judges in dushanbe . 
in those nine months ,  however ,  only <num>12</num>  police officers were brought to trial . 
international programme centre will assist tajik university students in studying abroad
in the <num>2008</num> -<num>2009</num>  academic year ,  <num>842</num>  tajik students went abroad to study at foreign universities under the ministry of education quota .

according to minister of education abdudjabbora rakhmanova ,  the resolution specifies guidelines for the scholarships and rules for candidate selection . 
there will also be a republic commission created for the training of personnel abroad in non-academic programs . 
almost us$1 . 4 million from the presidential fund will be allocated for university study abroad this year . 
after completing their studies ,  students who were granted opportunities for foreign study will be required to work for <num>10</num>  years in tajikistan ministries and agencies . 
tajikistan becomes vital part of supply line
russian border guards keep watch at the new bridge over the river panj between tajikistan and afghanistan . 
technical personnel are to make a number of visits to dushanbe in connection with the details of the negotiations . 
these will end in february when tajik president emomali rahmon visits brussels . 
zarifi stated that tajikistan is making great efforts to achieve stability and restore peace in afghanistan . 
until there is stability in afghanistan we will help all those who want to see peace in the country ,  he said . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and nato decision-makers are showing interest in alternative routes for the delivery of supplies to afghanistan because the khyber pass ,  the main corridor used by the anti-terror coalition in afghanistan ,  has effectively been cut off as a result of attacks by militants on supply convoys . 
the pakistani army began to lose its grip on the khyber after the resignation of general pervez musharraf . 
the plan for a transit bridge across russia and the central asian states ,  approved in the spring of <num>2008</num>  at the nato summit in bucharest ,  has now become vitally important for the coalition forces ,  especially since the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  intends to increase the number of its troops in afghanistan by <num>20,000</num> -<num>30,000</num>  .
this was the focus of a visit made by general david petraeus ,  the chief of <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  central command ,  to central asia . 
according to the new york times ,  tajikistan will obviously become an important part of the new transit corridor planned by the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>

taliban broadcasts wanted list in swat valley
masked pakistani pro-taliban militants ,  who support maulana fazlullah ,  a hardline cleric ,  stand guard at a taliban stronghold near mingora ,  the main town of pakistan's swat valley on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>2</num>  .
in one of his notorious radio broadcasts ,  taliban leader maulana fazlullah named politicians and government officials  " wanted "  by the militants . 
 " these people encouraged military operations in the area and are responsible for the killings of taliban and civilians "  ,  said the cleric . 
taliban spokesman muslim khan said the wanted list was drawn up following a meeting ,  or shura ,  chaired by fazlullah . 
 " all of them will have to appear before the taliban court ,  or they will face action "  ,  he told the news newspaper . 
those who have dared stand up to the taliban in this part of pakistan ,  once famed for its orchards and trout fishing ,  have been treated brutally and often publicly to deter others from resisting their control . 
local tribal leader pir samiullah ,  who was killed after he and his followers confronted the militants at his home in the village of mandal dag ,  was exhumed and his body strung up in a public square . 
followers who refused to indicate where his body had been buried were beheaded by the taliban . 
to counter the militants' increasing domination of the valley ,  located in the north west frontier province and just five hours from islamabad ,  the army has boosted the number of troops in the area . 
 [ uk independent ,  the news ] 
in the resolution of the energy crisis in tajikistan ,  a word for uzbekistan
press secretary of the barki tochik power generating firm nozirdzhon yedgori reported further cuts in the power supply to regions that now receive it only two to three hours over a <num>24</num>  hour period . 
<num>1</num>  uzbekistan halted the transmission of power supplied by turkmenistan to tajikistan ,  which heightened the severity of the countrys power shortage into an even more severe crisis . 
the two sides also outlined joint projects for civilian nuclear power . 
nuclear power corporation of india limited and kazakh national atomic energy company kazatomprom will jointly mine uranium ore ,  and kazakhstan will supply indian reactors with uranium fuel pellets and assemblies . 
in return ,  india will provide kazakhstan with technical assistance to develop indian-designed nuclear reactors . 
earlier ,  nurbakh rustemov ,  the chairman of the international affairs ,  defence and security committee of the lower chamber of parliament ,  said that kazakhstan and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  have signed a new five-year military cooperation plan .

the government will spend the money through the samruk-kazyna national welfare fund and the kazagro national holding ,  devoting <num>4</num>  $  billion to support the financial sector ,  <num>3</num>  $  billion to stabilise the real estate market and <num>1</num>  $  billion each to the small and medium-sized business sector ,  the agricultural sector and the infrastructure and industry sector to implement innovative projects . 
to avoid the inefficient or illegal use of funds ,  nazarbaev ordered the creation of a working group headed by financial inspection agency director elena bakhmutova who will monitor the spending of the stabilisation funds . 
the money should be used in a way that is open and transparent to the public ,  nazabaev said . 
tajikistan to construct more small hydroelectric plants
dushanbe - tajikistan will build more than <num>30</num>  small hydroelectric plants this year . 
the plans have been drawn up and they will cost more than us$5 million to construct and make operational according to expert estimates . 
head of energy policy at the tajik energy and industry ministry abdullo kurbonov said the plants will all be built on small rivers and will each have the capacity to produce <num>2,000</num>  to <num>5,000</num>  kilowatt hours of electricity . 
the islamic development bank will finance part of the work and the government will allocate foreign investments and state subsidies to cover the rest of the cost . 
tajikistan opened <num>27</num>  small hydroelectric plants in <num>2008</num>  and now has a total of <num>150</num>  .
last year they produced about <num>40</num>  million kilowatt hours of electricity . 
the national programme to develop the energy sector for the next <num>11</num>  years includes the construction of <num>72</num>  small and about <num>10</num>  medium-size hydroelectric plants . 
economist shukhrat zukhurov notes the governments decision is a strategic one and the development of small power plants is just as important as building big hydroelectric plants . 
small hydroelectric plants ,  which are low-cost and take little time to build ,  are most suitable for mountain villages that are difficult to connect to the national centralised power supply system .

daughter traded for fighting dog
gul shah is overcome with grief as she recalls how her <num>11</num> -year-old daughter was traded for a fighting dog . 
a gang of <num>12</num>  afghan men broke into her home at midnight and kidnapped her daughter ,  sanobar ,  dragging her from her bed . 
 " they were strangling me and stabbing me ,  "  shah said . 
 " i almost died . 
i had no one to protect me ,  no men .  " 
the intruders set upon shah in her single-room mud hut ,  beating her and stabbing her in the back four times . 
they dragged her daughter off into the night . 
sanobar vanished from her home in the ali abad district of the kunduz province of afghanistan five months ago . 
her mother has not seen her since ,  but has no doubt what became of her daughter . 
shah claims that sanobar was kidnapped under the orders of the district governor ,  to fulfil a marriage that was arranged when her daughter was only six months old . 
when sanobar's father died four years ago ,  her mother vowed that the arranged marriage would not go ahead ,  and refused to allow her daughter to become the wife of a man almost <num>30</num>  years older . 
she hid sanobar ,  and used a disguise to protect her identity . 
but the impoverished woman was unable to avoid one of the most powerful men in the region . 
the man who had drawn up the agreement with the husband of shah is a wealthy and influential villager named namatullah ,  who wanted the girl for his son ,  a deaf man who is over <num>40</num>  and suffers from mental health problems . 
 " the agreement was not legal and i didn't want her to marry him ,  "  shah said ,  shivering in her unheated hut ,  the ground outside covered in snow . 
when he told the district governor ,  mullah nazar shah ,  of the problem ,  he found an ally . 
shah enlisted the help of the local press and the afghan independent human rights commission . 
the abductors took the girl away to pakistan . 
the district governor denies all the charges . 
he said :   " the woman  [ gul shah ]  is completely crazy . 
she begs and in afghan culture no one can tolerate a women begging .  " 
the commission has launched an investigation into the case ,  but mohammad zahir zafari ,  the regional programme director ,  is not optimistic . 
i know our society and the mother is a poor woman without options .  "

pretoria ,  south africa -- fifa surprised some by choosing ravshan irmatov ,  a little-known referee and one of the youngest at the tournament ,  for one of the world cups most prestigious assignments :  the opening game between south africa and mexico . 
now ,  hes already preparing for his third match as a world cup referee . 
now ,  they will officiate a group b clash between argentina and greece june <num>22</num>  .
its just another match to me ,  irmatov at a press conference . 
argentines journalists asked what irmatov thought of being on the field with some of the worlds best players ,  including lionel messi . 
when i referee a match ,  i dont know who the best player in the world is ,  he said . 
for me all football players are equal ;  all teams are identical . 
the game has rules that i must follow ;  nothing about argentina and greece matters . 
for me it was more important to concentrate on my own actions . 
only in this case will the judging be successful . 
he said it was important for the three officials to work together . 
it would have been very difficult for me to achieve this level without ilyasov and kochkorov ,  he said . 
thats why im obligated to share my success with them . 
my father always finds fault in my refereering . 
he constantly points out to me that in some episode i was wrong ,  irmatov said . 
i try to explain to him that we cant always take a position where we can clearly see everything that happened . 
on tv ,  everything is easier to see and from different angles ,  too . 
irmatov said that when he referees in central asia ,  he tries to watch matches of teams he is going to officiate so he will know what might require special attention . 
at the world cup ,  a technical observation team has recordings of all the games for officials to watch . 
the pace of the world cup is challenging . 
june <num>22</num>  second  match will be the third in ten days . 
tournament referees have special instructors for physical training and postgame recovery . 
some referees have already been relegated to assistant referee status after making bad calls in the world cup . 
irmatov said he has no idea what will happen after the third match . 
the judging committee will make that decision about who will officiate in the final ,  he said . 
but i will do everything to be in the final . 
just as every soldier dreams of becoming a general ,  every judge dreams of working the world championship final .

human rights activists claim the verdicts were handed down hurriedly and are excessively harsh . 
ombudsman tursunbek akun ,  a kyrgyz human rights activist ,  said he believes the authorities had clearly gone too far with the various sentences handed down for the <num>32</num>  defendants . 
torture was widely used to get testimony . 
there were just four actual supporters of the khizb ut-takhrir party  ( among the accused )  and the rest were placed in the same category . 
i plan to draw public attention to this ,  he said . 
the kyrgyz human rights council asked ombudsman tursunbek akun to conduct an independent investigation into the nookat events . 
the gross violation of the basic right to a free trial ,  the mass repression of ordinary citizens ,  torture ,  and blackmail by the law-enforcement agencies could undermine confidence in the state and trigger anger against its representatives and increase radicalism in the region ,  the human rights activists said . 
at the same time ,  lawyers for the <num>32</num>  people convicted of involvement in the nookat events are preparing an appeal to the supreme court of kyrgyzstan .

the building of the rogun hydroelectric station  ( hes )  on the river amudarya has been on hold since soviet times . 
the station would generate <num>3,600</num>  megawatts of electricity ,  and its dam would be the highest in central asia . 
tajikistan has high hopes for the hes in light of its catastrophic electricity shortage . 
for tajikistan ,  the rogun hes would not only solve its energy shortage but would allow the country to export electricity to afghanistan and other countries .

a full programme of scientific research experiments have been developed for the kazakh cosmonauts to perform on the international space station . 
the research includes a series of experiments in space-based materials science ,  and studies of the optical properties of the earth's upper atmosphere ,  genetic engineering ,  and human physiology and nutrition . 
electrical power returns to energy-starved tajikistan
the decision to restart transmitting turkmen-generated electricity to tajikistan via uzbekistan was made in mid-february in tashkent by power engineers from both countries . 
uzbekistan also agreed to supply tajikistan with power generated within its borders . 
under the new agreements ,  reached during the initial stage of implementation ,  more than <num>8</num>  million kwh and <num>1.5</num>  million kwh will be supplied daily by turkmenistan and uzbekistan respectively . 
tajikistan itself generates around <num>40</num>  million kwh per day ,  which is insufficient to meet domestic needs . 
the tajik aluminium company ,  which alone consumes more than half that amount daily ,  had to cut its output by ten percent during the power shortage .

tashkent - the woman born to be happy information campaign was presented at the mukimi theatre in the capital on march <num>3</num>  .
the presentation featured clips to be broadcast on the countrys radio and television stations ,  and brochures and posters . 
the campaign aims to draw attention to discrimination against women ,  prevent the illegal trade of people ,  promote the joint raising of children ,  and advocate equal access to education and decision-making . 
organised by the uzbek womens committee ,  the un development programme and the un population fund ,  the campaign is aimed at increasing the role of women in society as an indispensable instrument for reducing poverty . 
uzbekistan has more than <num>80</num>  laws directly related to protecting womens rights and interests . 
the country joined the un convention on the elimination of discrimination against women  ( cedaw )  in <num>1995</num>  .
according to gender issues specialist natalia kurganovskaya ,  even though women are full-fledged members of society and have equal rights under the law ,  uzbek society still assigns them the traditional role of housewife . 
campaign organisers said they have received support from both state and several independent television and radio stations that will donate airtime for broadcasting the information clips throughout the year . 
creating a common electric power market in central and south asia
the nurek power plant-the largest in the world with an earth-fill dam
creating a common electric power market within the framework of the states of central and south asia will depend largely on implementation of tajikistans power projects ,  the head of the administration for energy policy in tajikistans ministry of power and industry ,  abdullo kurbonov said . 
it is his opinion that tajikistan possesses a great deal of energy resources ,  which when developed ,  will be able to provide not only for local demand ,  but also for exporting large quantities of electric power to the countries of the asian region . 
only three percent of the <num>527</num>  billion kilowatt hours  ( kwh )  of annual potential are being used at this time . 
of special importance for tajikistan itself and for the neighbouring countries is the work on the project to build the rogunsk and sangtudinsk power plants ,  and also the <num>500</num>  kv south-north power transmission line ,  and the <num>220</num>  kv sangtuda  ( tajikistan ) -sherkhan bandard  ( afghanistan )  line ,  the director of the centre for implementing power projects in tajikistan ,  sanyat rakhimov said . 
the annual capacity of the <num>3,600</num>  mw rogunsk plant alone will be more than <num>13</num>  billion kwh . 
the south-north transmission line will make it possible to move large volumes of electric power from the states of central asia into the south asian countries ,  rakhimov notes . 
these power projects are being implemented using state assets ,  and also by attracting foreign investments and loans from international financial institutions . 
afghanistan ,  pakistan ,  india and kyrgyzstan are as interested as tajikistan in completing these projects . 
afghanistan ,  pakistan ,  and india have an interest in obtaining electric power ,  for those countries the demand is keeping up with growth as the population expands . 
in kyrgyzstan there is a real possibility for exporting its power via the energy system . 
kazakh worker defends his right to wear a beard
almaty - the aktobe city court has ruled that talgat kyrkymbai who was fired for wearing a beard must be allowed to return to work . 
this was the first time a lawsuit had been filed in kazakhstan for workplace discrimination related to religious beliefs . 
he converted to islam in <num>2006</num>  and grew a beard . 
workers in the department where kyrkymbai works must have gas masks available for emergencies ,  but standard gas masks arent designed for men with beards . 
the chinese managers refused to buy a special gas mask for kyrkymbai and he was sacked from his job last november . 
kyrkymbai filed a lawsuit that reinstated him in the job and obtained the wages he was due from the time he was sacked . 
the kyrkymbai case represents progress on religious rights in kazakhstan ,  where there are numerous prejudices . 
for example ,  according to madina churina ,  director of the womens madrassa bereket in almaty ,  muslim women who wear headscarves have difficulty finding jobs ,  a case of blatant discrimination . 
while kazakhstan declared itself a secular state in its constitution ,  religious consciousness is still growing in the country . 
tolerance for the rights of believers ,  however ,  remains low . 
eighty percent of marriages in rural kyrgyzstan involve abduction
most experts believe the problem is due to traditions that do not discourage violence against women . 
kyrgyzstan - according to statistics released by the office of the kyrgyz procurator-general ,  <num>268</num>  complaints were lodged over the last three years regarding women being forced into marriage . 
head of the parliamentary committee for gender policy cholpon abdullayeva said that in rural areas up to <num>80</num>  percent of marriages involve the abduction of the bride-to-be . 
 " many of the women involved are between <num>18</num>  and <num>25</num>  , but in southern regions girls are often forced to marry even younger "  ,  abdullayeva said . 
a total of <num>71</num>  criminal cases were brought against <num>98</num>  people following investigations ,  and a variety of sentences were imposed on those found guilty . 
the kyrgyz criminal code makes provision for fines of between us$800 and <num>1,600</num>  $  or up to three years' imprisonment for the crime . 
according to figures published by law enforcement agencies ,  <num>19</num>  percent of officially registered cases of forced marriage involve minors . 
underage marriages are often associated with complex social and moral issues such as teenage motherhood and low-paid work . 
 " maternal death and child mortality in kyrgyzstan are directly linked with the low level of education of young mothers "  ,  says nurgul asylbekova ,  the gender issues coordinator of the un development programme in kyrgyzstan . 
she also says that more than <num>33</num>  percent of children in kyrgyzstan are born out of wedlock . 
underage couples have their marriages witnessed by mullahs . 
asylbekova says that religious officials should be obliged to demand official registration documents before officiating at weddings and also keep records of the ceremonies they conduct . 
government agencies in tajikistan cut expenses
tajikistan government offices cut costs ;  no more blackberries for bureaucrats . 
the president also ordered responsible parties to ensure timely payments of pensions and salaries . 
his press office stated that strict measures will be taken based on the results of the first quarter . 
the countrys agro-industrial sector was also examined at the meeting . 
rakhmon ordered an acceleration of the rate of spring field work ,  an increase in the amount of small loans for the sector and the introduction of measures to ensure food security . 
on march <num>10</num>  , two of the countrys banks ,  agroinvestbank and the state amonatbank ,  announced they are unable to issue loans for agricultural needs due to a lack of funds . 
almost all banks in tajikistan now are having liquidity problems . 
economist davlat ismailov noted that while the banks have not yet openly aired their difficult situations ,  customers know about them from the lack of cash in atms and bank cash offices . 
to get money from their banks people must stand in line for several days . 
according to ismailov ,  support from world financial institutions will not be enough to save the banking sector because such funds would be just a drop in the ocean compared to the value of remittances from migrant tajiks before the crisis ,  which last year amounted to nearly <num>45</num>  percent of the countrys gdp . 
secondly ,  given the extensive corrupution in tajikistan ,  there is no certainty that international financial assistance would reach designated destinations . 
according to sabokhat mirzoyeva ,  an employee of the land management ,  geodetics and cartography agency ,  government employees have not received their salaries in two months . 
mirzoyeva complains that management has stated that employees should not expect salaries because this month there are no funds in the account . 
kyrgyz ex-foreign minister arrested
during interrogation ,  dzhekshenkulov said that he had never given his prize pistol to anyone . 
he has repeatedly said in the past that he was neither acquainted with the turkish businessman nor had any business dealings with him . 
his attorney ,  nina zotova ,  plans to appeal the courts decision . 
attorneys are asking why the police investigating the two-year-old murder have only now announced that the ex-ministers pistol may have been used in the crime . 
in <num>2005</num>  , dzhekshenkulov was an active member of the tulip revolution and the closest ally of president kurmanbek bakiev who came to power as a result of the uprising . 
as soon as news of dzhekshenkulovs detention became known ,  colleagues gathered before the court in the centre of bishkek and responded with harsh words . 
head of the ata meken party omurbek tekebaev announced that ,  the political struggle in kyrgyzstan has entered a phase of political terrorism . 
the ak shumkar party demanded the authorities end political persecution and called on the countrys leadership to use honest ,  civilised methods of political struggle . 
the interior ministry announced the opening of the criminal case in chetkins murder more than a year ago . 
at the time ,  an active member of the abdykadyrov organised criminal gang was detained in connection with the case . 
kazakhstan's national bank backs move to shutter private currency exchange bureaus
non-bank currency exchange bureaus generally work around the clock and offer better rates than banks . 
 ( photo by natalia kolesnikova / afp / getty images ) 
astana - kazakhstan's national bank is endorsing a draft bill to limit all currency exchange operations to banks only ,  said national bank chairman grigoriy marchenko on march <num>2</num>  .
he said money changers have been engaged in a deliberate campaign to encourage people to buy dollars by spreading rumours of a second wave of devaluation of the tenge . 
according to marchenko ,  the country's citizens bought up us$1 . 2 billion and <num>240</num>  million euro at exchange booths in january following the slide of the russian rouble and strong expectations that the tenge would be devalued . 
 " this was a record amount ,  the highest in our entire history "  ,  the national bank head noted . 
following the devaluation ,  stability returned to kazakhstan's money market and long lines at exchange bureaus disappeared . 
by that time ,  however ,  the majority of kazakhstan's citizens had moved their savings into dollars and euro . 
talgat akuov ,  the president of kazakhstan's independent association of entrepreneurs ,  is categorically against the national bank's move . 
he believes that besides inconveniencing the population ,  shuttering the private exchange bureaus may discredit kazakhstan in the eyes of foreign investors . 
but marchenko ,  appointed only a few months ago ,  enjoys a high level of trust among the people of kazakhstan ,  and popular opinion on this controversial move appears to be on his side for the time being .

kyrgyzstan - according to general secretary of the kyrgyz state committee for migration and employment toktosun sadyrov ,  kyrgyz traders in kazakhstan will soon be able to conduct business without work permits . 
new rules easing the registration of kyrgyz traders in kazakhstan have been laid down in an inter-governmental sole tradership arrangement that will be negotiated next month in astana . 
agreement would halt disputes between the two countries on the issue . 
a number of kyrgyz traders arrested during past raids at marketplaces in almaty have been deported from kazakhstan . 
under the new rules ,  kyrgyz traders will only have to register with local tax and migration authorities and will not be required to obtain work permits . 
we sell honey ,  walnuts and medicinal herbs . 
the new rules will be a huge help to us . 
they will make it easier for us to work here ,  and trading will become more profitable here than it is at home ,  said kyrgyz entrepreneur sergey tomatsky . 
there are two schools of thought in kazakhstan on migrant workers . 
some support a quota system that would deal equitably with the problem of the shortage of domestic workers . 
others ,  primarily in law enforcement ,  consider migrants from neighbouring countries as a threat to national security . 
tajik banks unable to repay government loans
tajik cotton farms were unable to pay government loans on time . 
 ( photo by burak kara / getty images ) 
tajikistan - the management of open joint stock company orienbank asked the tajik finance ministry march <num>12</num>  for extensions on the repayment of loans provided in <num>2008</num>  to finance cotton farms . 
orienbank first deputy chairman umed davlatzod said the bank wont be able to repay more than us$900 , 000 by april <num>1</num>  because cotton farms to date have repaid only <num>30</num>  percent of the government loan the finance ministry provided in <num>2008</num>  to support the countrys cotton industry . 
the bank forecasts that no more than <num>40</num>  to <num>45</num>  percent of the loan amount will be repaid by april <num>1</num>  .
farmers cant pay back the loans because prices and demand for cotton have fallen ,  and naturally they are having problems selling their product . 
furthermore ,  <num>2008</num>  was a drought year and farmers had problems with harmful insects ,  which reduced the harvest ,  davlatzod said . 
in <num>2008</num>  , the tajik government provided more than <num>36</num>  $  million to five banks to make loans to agricultural enterprises . 
the banks received the money at an interest rate of <num>12</num>  percent annually and the farms got loans at interest rates between <num>14</num>  and <num>22</num>  percent depending on their risk factors . 
davlatzod said loan repayment periods should be extended for a year or two and not just for one or two months . 
the management of agroinvestbank made a similar request to the finance ministry . 
the bank thus far has repaid the finance ministry just <num>3.5</num>  $  million of the <num>13</num>  $  million it received for loans to cotton farmers . 
a mechanism to finance farms using budget money was used to reduce the debt of cotton growers to foreign creditors last year . 
the farms were previously financed through futures companies using money the national bank of tajikistan raised on foreign markets . 
repayment was slow and the farmers debt to investors grew each year . 
the debt reached <num>409</num>  $  million in <num>2008</num>  and the decision was made to switch to government financing through tajik banks .

kazakhstan-according to minister of industry and trade vladimir shkolnik ,  an increase in import duties on used imported vehicles could lead to an increase in domestic car production in kazakhstan by <num>30</num>  to <num>35</num>  percent . 
shkolnik noted that his calculations are based on automobile market development statistics compiled by the russian federation after the introduction of measures to restrict imports of used passenger cars in <num>2002</num> -<num>2003</num>  .
they take into account the purchasing power of kazakh citizens . 
human rights organization call for defence of independent media in kyrgyzstan
in kyrgyzstan ,  <num>21</num>  journalists have been attacked ,  six newspapers were closed and five journalists and editors fled the country since the beginning of <num>2007</num>  .
kyrgyzstan - the savage march <num>3</num>  attack on syrgak abdyldayev ,  a political correspondent for the independent newspaper reporter bishkek ,  has inflamed an already heated discussion concerning freedom of speech in kyrgyzstan . 
at a meeting with the opposition social-democratic party on march <num>11</num>  , the director of the human rights organisation coalition for democracy and civil society ,  dinara oshurakhunova ,  called for the creation of a special commission to defend independent media and journalists . 
 " recent attacks on journalists and the country's media are clear evidence that human rights ,  freedom of speech and dissent are all under assault in kyrgyzstan ,  "  said baktybek beshimov ,  the parliamentary leader of the social democratic party . 
since the beginning of <num>2007</num>  , <num>21</num>  journalists have been attacked ,  six newspapers were closed and five journalists and editors fled the country following personal threats ,  according to statistics compiled by the party . 
beshimov plans to deliver a speech at the european parliament requesting that international organisations reconsider their relations with kyrgyzstan's leadership . 
there are more than <num>20</num>  professional organisations for journalists in kyrgyzstan including two unions ,  one of which is independent . 
but lacking any real clout ,  they play more of an advisory than a juridical role in defending independent media and journalists .

shadievs colleague ulugbek ormonov noted that it is impossible to end a centuries-long tradition with a single decree . 
its important to take into account the way people think ,  consult with elders and rely on their support ,  he said . 
isabekov ,  the initiator of the proposed restrictions ,  noted that in <num>2006</num>  parliament adopted a decree on conducting family events by government employees which exists only on paper . 
against that background ,  local media reported briefly that the vice-speaker himself recently held a lavish celebration for his son's wedding ,  inviting <num>700</num>  guests to the expensive dasmiya restaurant for the reception .

for example ,  the akmolinsk and karagandinsk regions and city of astana are included in saryarka sec . 
the goal of secs is to manage state assets in all regions effectively through partnerships between the government and the private sector . 
in other words ,  secs are intended to establish commercial enterprises that will benefit the state .

tajik bill on freedom of conscience and religion concerns experts
religious posters on the streets of dushanbe . 
in tajikistan ,  <num>95</num>  percent of muslims belong to the hanafi sect . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
the bills reference to the sunni hanafi branch playing a special role in the development of tajikistan reduces the significance of the shiite ismaili minority in the gorno-badakhshan region ,  according to the press release . 
tajik islamic renaissance party leader mukhiddin kabiri asserts that the decision to specifically reference hanafi in the bill reflects the fact that <num>95</num>  percent of tajikistans muslims are hanafi . 
kabiri ,  however ,  also says the bill contains a series of articles that limit the rights of religious minorities . 
for example ,  one provision states that government approval is necessary to establish contacts with members of other confessions located abroad ,  which is an absurd violation of both international and national rights …  [ and constitutes ]  direct interference in the activity of religious organisations . 
furthermore ,  registering a religious organisation will require confirmation from a local branch of the executive authorities attesting that its followers lived in the country for the previous five years and practiced the faith . 
according to victor kim ,  chairman of the association of koreans in tajikistan and a member of the civil council ,  it will be impossible for islamic organisations in tajikistan to provide such a record . 
local administrations dont keep statistical information on the populations nationality or religion ,  so no administration is going to be able to supply any such record ,  he said .

 ( photo by reuters /  stringer russia ) 
dushanbe - chairman of orienbank khasan asadullozoda has given tajikistans jewish community a building he owns in downtown dushanbe to use as a synagogue . 
according to head rabbi of dushanbe synagogue mikhail abdurakhmanov ,  after the only synagogue in tajikistan was demolished in june <num>2008</num>  under a decision by the city government ,  the jewish community had nowhere to conduct religious services for nine months . 
currently ,  the jewish community in dushanbe consists of slightly more than <num>300</num>  people ,  many of whom are elderly and poor and depend on the synagogue to provide them kosher meals either in its cafeteria or through home deliveries . 
built more than <num>100</num>  years ago and nationalised in <num>1952</num>  , the synagogue officially belongs to the state . 
arguing that the government could not provide money to religious institutions ,  the city declined to compensate the community for the loss of the building . 
the old synagogue was completely razed in late june <num>2008</num>  to provide space for a park adjacent to the presidential palace .

turkmenistan - a presidential decree reinstating payment of salaries and fees to broadcasters ,  which had been ended during the rule of turkmenbashi ,  entered into force on april <num>1</num>  .
television and radio in turkmenistan still bear the hallmarks of soviet influence ,  and little has changed since independence . 
heavy-handed state control and censorship is still in place . 
there are five state television channels ,  altyn asyr turkmenistan  ( golden age of turkmenistan )  ;  yaslyk  ( youth )  ;  miras  ( heritage )  ;  channel <num>4</num>  , which is broadcast via satellite ;  and the music channel turkmen owazy ,  which hit the airwaves in <num>2008</num>  .
they all carry programmes <num>17</num>  hours a day and ,  with the exception of channel <num>4</num>  , broadcast in turkmen . 
the majority of their air time is taken up by music shows featuring concerts performed by song and dance ensembles ,  folk and variety groups and old films and cartoons . 
most songs that are broadcast praise the president . 
a cabinet meeting attended by the head of state ,  however ,  is always aired live and regularly scheduled programmes are aired at different times . 
much time is taken up by such events and reports on them are repeated several times over the days that follow . 
tajikistan assesses risk from glacial melting
tajikistan- tajikistan has begun work on a project to assess and avert the risk of glacial lake outbursts ,  or catastrophic flooding when meltwater suddenly breaches naturally dammed lakes . 
combined funding of us$1 . 47 million for the project was provided by the british department for international development ,  the swiss agency for development and cooperation ,  and international aid organisations focus humanitarian assistance and the aga khan foundation . 
the project will evaluate the risk of glacial lake outburst flooding and take steps to reduce the threat in the zerafshan valley in the countrys north and the dzhirgatel district and the gorno-badakhshan autonomous region in the east . 
approximately <num>200,000</num>  people in these regions are expected to benefit from the projects work . 
focuss communications specialist soro marodaliyeva explains that ,  following the risk-assessment stage ,  the organisation will turn to education efforts in local communities to help prepare inhabitants for an emergency . 
the organisation is also providing scientific instruments to measure water levels and current flows in the glacial lakes . 
experts expect tajikistan's glacial cover to shrink by around ten to <num>15</num>  percent in the near-term as a result of the rise in average temperatures ,  a warming effect that will soon lead to reduced water levels in the country's rivers . 
this in turn will have cascading negative effects on tajikistan's agriculture ,  energy production and manufacturing sectors .

kyrgyzstan decides not to add tabligi jamaat to list of terrorist and extremist organisations
kyrgyzstans presidential security council cites islamisation of the republics population as a threat to the political system . 
 ( phoTo :  vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
on april <num>2</num>  the office of kyrgyzstans general prosecutor unexpectedly withdrew its legal action to have tabligi jamaat recognised as a terrorist and an extremist organisation . 
earlier ,  when it announced the filing of the action with the court ,  the prosecutors press office described tabligi jamaat as an organisation which is distinguished by its radicalism and intolerance of other forms of religious denomination . 
in the opinion of kyrgyz authorities ,  the press office statement said the doctrine of this religious-proselytising network established in india in <num>1927</num>  contradicts the principle of the equality of all religions and frequently leads to different interpretations of the canons of islam… the movements proponents are convinced that islam must supersede all other religions . 
this could in future lead to the occurrence of serious clashes and destabilisation within the country ,  the press office concluded . 
in several countries ,  members of tabligi jamaat have been accused of involvement in terrorist activities ,  particularly with al-qaeda ,  while in others the organisation is regarded as an influential religious missionary network . 
the centre of tabligi jamaats activities in kyrgyzstan is the town of balykchy . 
in the new edition of its concept of national security adopted last year ,  kyrgyzstans presidential security council cited the islamisation of the republics population among threats to national security . 
the kyrgyz ministry of the interior puts the number of sympathetic or active participants in religious organisations recognised within the country as extremist at about <num>10,000</num>  .
turkmenistan - at turkmenistans museum of visual art ,  an unusual exhibition has opened in a hall recreating the workshop of master artist izzat klychev ,  one of turkmenistans greatest painters . 
no museum of visual arts in turkmenistan has done such a thing before . 
the hall displays not only the masters work ,  but the personal items and effects that were in his workshop while he was alive and working there . 
ancient african sculptures ,  silver indian teapots and water pipes ,  a hand-painted uzbek table ,  leather beanbag chairs from egypt ,  woven policemans headgear from lesotho and antique clocks are just some of the items that surrounded the artist . 
izzat klychev was a peoples artist of the soviet union ,  an academic at the russian academy of arts ,  a national prize laureate and holder of a number of others including the makhtumkuli prize . 
during the soviet era ,  the artist was well known to art lovers and specialists . 
albums of his works and books about him were widely published and his works were exhibited in the worlds greatest museums .

his artistic heritage is not only a national treasure ,  but a contribution to the treasury of world culture . 
local leaders rebuild their communities
in afghanistan ,  the national solidarity program  ( nsp )  has shown that when it comes to development ,  local communities know best . 
former world bank economist william easterly has often emphasised ,  it is the local people that understand problems more than high-level officials . 
run through the ministry of rural rehabilitation and development  ( mrrd )  ,  the nsp ,  was created by the government to enable afghan communities to identify ,  plan ,  manage and monitor their own development projects . 
since the beginning of the program in <num>2003</num>  , <num>31,000</num>  community led projects have been funded in over <num>352</num>  districts in afghanistans <num>34</num>  provinces . 
map of the districts of baghlan province of afghanistan . 
one example of nsp at work is in the dahana-e ghori district of baglan province . 
the district also had no access to clean drinking water . 
the road running through district was in a horrible condition and bad weather made it even worse . 
it was dusty in the summer and muddy in the winter . 
the bad roads also made travelling for water nearly impossible for villagers . 
a truck used to bring drinking water to our village . 
it would cost each family at least <num>50</num>  afghani a day to buy enough water for their families ,  said karimullah ,  a resident of kanadahari qeshlaq village . 
a total of <num>100</num>  construction projects have been implemented in all <num>65</num>  villages of the dahana-e ghori district since the nsp program started in <num>2003</num>  .
community development councils  ( cdcs )  have been formed across the country allowing for residents to discuss the most pressing needs and help oversee initiatives . 
nsp has enabled local communities to build schools ,  roads ,  water supply facilities ,  health centres and hydro-power stations in the most remote areas of the country . 
in many areas ,  strong local community structures such as cdcs have been an important foundation to strong local government . 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  for example ,  has traditionally had an influential local government providing fire protection ,  sewer services ,  transit services and water resources . 
also ,  many school districts are managed locally . 
in afghanistan ,  communities realize that waiting for the federal government to reach them is not the most effective route for change . 
it is often up to local communities to come up with the best strategies . 
this year ,  the international community pledged an additional <num>65</num>  $  million to afghanistan to support nsp . 
transit of heroin and opium through tajikistan down ,  cannabis up
dushanbe - the drug control agency under the tajik president reports that the flow of heroin and raw opium to tajikistan from afghanistan has dropped ,  but the import of cannabis drugs  ( marijuana and hashish )  has increased . 
agency director fakhriddin dzhonmakhmadov said this is owing to a reduction in the opium poppy crop in north-eastern afghanistan bordering tajikistan and a decline in the supply of precursors and other components needed to produce heroin . 
a report by afghan law-enforcement agencies said <num>11,000</num>  litres of precursors and <num>600</num>  tons of narcotic substances were confiscated from narcotics producers in the country last year ,  and <num>34</num>  heroin laboratories were destroyed . 
the drug control department in afghanistans interior ministry said precursors for heroin production come primarily from pakistan and iran . 
only one attempt to import precursors to afghanistan using the termez  ( uzbekistan )  - khairaton  ( afghanistan )  route was reported in <num>2008</num>  .
that attempt to smuggle <num>1,600</num>  litres of the substance was prevented by uzbek special forces .

tajikistan adopts new system for funding comprehensive schools
this classroom in a comprehensive school outside dushanbe is in serious need of repairs . 
when the schools board of governors gains control over spending ,  it will have more opportunities to transform the appearance of its school building . 
 ( photo by akbar borissovafp / getty images ) 
tajikistan - tajik minister of education abdujabbor rahmonov announced april <num>13</num>  that a new state school funding system will be introduced at the start of the next academic year . 
money will be allocated according to the number of students at each school ,  its type and its location . 
fathiddin ismonov ,  the head of the budget implementation ,  planning and forecasting department at the ministry of education ,  says that schools in mountainous areas ,  which usually have few pupils ,  have nothing to fear . 
we intend to support schools in rural areas . 
a special index will be used to grant them more money than will be given to high schools in towns ,  where fees are charged for some forms of education ,  ismonov said . 
this year ,  for instance ,  the government will allocate us$40 per pupil to comprehensive schools in towns and <num>10</num>  $  more per pupil to rural comprehensives . 
a total of us$290 million was allocated to the education sector in the <num>2009</num>  budget . 
according to ismonov ,  a further advantage of the new system is that funding will be granted in single blocs that are not itemised at the beginning of the fiscal year ,  which will allow each school to determine its own spending priorities . 
the ministry has decreed that class sizes must not exceed <num>25</num>  pupils . 
rahmonov believes the initiative will raise teaching standards across the nation . 
he claims it will encourage schools to compete with each other to attract pupils which will improve the quality of the education they offer .

the day after the editorial appeared ,  democratic forces gathered at a forum in almaty where four political groups announced their intention  " to create a single unified democratic opposition party in kazakhstan for the duration of the economic crisis . 
 "  the four are the united social-democratic party  ( usdp )  ,  the azat party ,  the communists and alga ,  an unregistered party . 
 " we must not repeat the mistakes of the past ,  when hurried calls to unite led more than once to subsequent schisms .  " 
with this in mind ,  we are organising a committee for the creation of a single democratic opposition party ,  and we invite other parties to join the discussion "  ,  azat leader bulat abilov said in support of the initiative . 
 " i can't foresee any real opposition party consolidation ,  because the country's crisis is not so deep that they would actually feel compelled to unite <abbr>…</abbr>  the forum was just a way for opposition parties to make themselves heard ,  little more than a roll call in the army "  ,  says political analyst nurlan yerimbetov .

chinas economic impact on kyrgyzstan more beneficial than harmful
kara-suu's wholesale market is a critical source of income for residents of kyrgyzstan's osh region and bordering areas of neighbouring countries . 
kyrgyzstan-during a hearing of the migration ,  labour ,  social policy and health committee ,  parliamentary deputy damira niyazaliyeva called on the legislature to defend the country's domestic markets from chinese entrepreneurs . 
according to the lawmaker ,  chinese traders have monopolised stalls at kyrgyzstan's largest bazaars and markets . 
 " the quota for foreign workers has been set at <num>8,000</num>  people ,  which is <num>4,000</num>  less than last year . 
chinese citizens are only <num>0.4</num>  percent of kyrgyzstan's working-age population ,  "  she says . 
ryskulova pointed out that the country would face economic hardships if its chinese population pulled up stakes and went home ,  as this would deprive the state of customs duties and taxes . 
the number of foreign workers in kyrgyzstan has already dropped precipitously following recent hikes in the country's tax rates . 
one of the largest markets for chinese consumer goods is in the osh region's kara-suu ,  and this area has seen a number of chinese entrepreneurs depart . 
on march <num>30</num>  , kyrgyzstan and china signed a new intergovernmental agreement on technical assistance and economic cooperation . 
the agreement lays out plans for a regional centre for cross-border trade in the alay district of the osh region . 
beijing has also expressed interest in building a new hydroelectric facility on the naryn cascade . 
in may ,  osh will host a traditional fair from kashgar ,  china . 
former kyrgyz foreign affairs minister muratbek imanaliyev believes that shrewd exploitation of china's economic potential will allow kyrgyzstan to hook its brake van to the locomotive pulling china into the ranks of economic superpowers . 
ethnic clashes turn to organised persecution in kyrgyzstan
local residents believe that the ethnic rioting was the direct result of the passivity and indifference of law enforcement officials .

on april <num>26</num>  , the village of petrovka in kyrgyzstan's chui region became a flashpoint when ethnic russians and kyrgyz youths initiated violence against local kurds . 
the spark igniting the violence was the allegation that a kurd raped a small child . 
at the beginning of april ,  the grandmother of a four-year old child reported to the police that a local resident and ethnic kurd ,  abdulla ,   ( last name withheld by investigators )  ,  had raped her granddaughter . 
although forensic analyses did not bear out this version of events ,  the child was discovered to have a sexually transmitted disease . 
investigators speculate that that abdulla may have committed sexual acts other than intercourse with the child and thus could have passed on the disease . 
on april <num>19</num>  , the grandmother ,  the sole guardian of the child ,  was found dead . 
on april <num>27</num>  , local residents gathered in protest and blocked off the bishkek-osh highway . 
they demanded the release of the young men detained by the police and called for the forced eviction of kurds from petrovka . 
in addition ,  they refused to meet with daniyar usenov ,  the kyrgyz president's chief of staff . 
these allegations against the opposition were brushed aside by social democratic party leader almazbek atambayev ,  a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections . 
kyrgyzstan's president expressed outrage at the  " inexcusably long criminal investigation "  and  " the inaction of local authorities "  at a meeting with kongantiyev and the prosecutor-general . 
after the meeting ,  the internal affairs ministry announced that it was releasing almost all of the detainees . 
in addition ,  the district head of the internal affairs ministry ,  the prosecutor of the moskovsky district of the chui region and the municipal chief were all dismissed . 
uzbekistan reaches agreement with south korea on uranium deliveries
uranium ore . 
proven uranium reserves in uzbekistan amount to between <num>55,000</num>  and <num>80,000</num>  tonnes
in may ,  a delegation from the republic of korea ,  headed by prime minister han seung soo ,  arrived in uzbekistan for an official visit . 
despite being sold at some of the very highest prices in the market for long-term deals ,  uzbek uranium is and remains approximately two to two-and-a-half times cheaper than <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  uranium . 
this is thanks to highly efficient lixiviation technology and to the fact that its production costs are falling  ( they are now amongst the lowest in the world )  . 
in private conversation ,  one official admitted that uzbekistan was not satisfied with trade volumes and prices ,  as ,  according to the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  ,  it is capable of selling a lot more uranium than it does at present . 
uzbekistan is seventh in the world in terms of uranium reserves and fifth in terms of uranium mining . 
apart from the nuclear reactor at the uzbek academy of science's institute of nuclear physics in the town of ulugbek ,  the country has no nuclear industry of its own . 
the vvp-sm research reactor was equipped for research purposes in <num>1969</num>  .
when it was first brought online it had a capacity of only <num>2</num>  mw . 
reconstruction carried out in <num>1971</num>  gave it an increased capacity of up to <num>10</num>  mw . 
nevertheless ,  this reactor is regarded as being for research purposes rather than industrial use . 
pure and applied research is carried out at the institute of nuclear physics' base ,  including under international programs and grants . 
the agreement with south korea is by no means the first . 
as early as the fall of <num>2006</num>  , the prime minister of uzbekistan and the president of the republic of korea signed a memorandum of understanding which envisaged annual supplies of <num>300</num>  tonnes of uzbek uranium ore being sent to south korea between <num>2010</num>  and <num>2014</num>  .

hizb ut-tahrir members convicted in uzbekistan ;  human rights advocates cast doubt on veracity of convicted mens testimony
karimov was previously sentenced to <num>14</num>  years imprisonment in <num>1999</num>  but released under an amnesty in <num>2003</num>  .
observers say the uzbek government decided to release members of the party early on condition that they showed contrition and agreed to cooperate with the secret services . 
all of the six hizb ut-tahrir members were charged with undermining constitutional order ,  creating extremist and fundamentalist religious organisations and preparing and distributing materials threatening to public safety . 
human-rights advocates aver that uzbekistan has launched a fresh wave of convictions for members of banned religious groups and that some who have already served jail terms or been released under amnesties are now being convicted a second time . 
surat ikramov ,  the president of the uzbek independent human-rights campaigners action group ,  says authorities are deliberately trying to create the impression that the country faces a terrorist threat .

peace deal shattered as taliban ambush police and behead two local officials
the attack came despite pakistan making further concessions to the taliban by establishing an islamic appeal court in swat . 
officials had insisted that by carrying out its part of the agreement ,  the government could gain more support from the public to take action against the taliban if the militants violate the pact . 
the apparent collapse of the deal raised the prospect of the pakistani army having to retake control of swat where the militants are now deeply entrenched . 
rejoining the battle in swat would involve heavy casualties and the uprooting of thousands more people from their homes . 
according to northwest frontier province  ( nwfp )  information minister mian iftikhar hussain ,  who helped negotiate the pact ,   " we set up islamic courts ;  we gave them islamic judges ;  yet they do not accept this . 
they have some other agenda . 
we will fight them and ,  god willing ,  this handful of miscreants will be defeated and the nation will prevail .  " 
since the peace agreement was signed in february ,  militants have infiltrated neighbouring districts of buner and dir where fierce fighting continues . 
on may <num>3</num>  , the pakistani army accused militants of holding <num>2,000</num>  villagers in pir baba in buner as human shields to stop the launch of an offensive .

astana - answering questions from journalists following a cabinet meeting in astana on may <num>14</num>  , kazakhstan's deputy defence minister mukhtar altynbayev stated that ,   " whether kazakhstan will participate in the nato peacekeeping operation in afghanistan hinges on political decisions now being considered by the country's leadership . 
 "  the invitation to join coalition forces in the fight against the taliban was extended by nato special representative for the south caucasus and central asia robert simmons . 
 "  he also emphasised ,  however ,  that ,   " we need to be ready for peacekeeping operations ,  should the political decision be made ,  but we have not yet discussed which forces to send .  " 
in the past ,  kazakhstan has sent a special minesweeper and engineering and technical units to assist coalition forces in iraq . 
the military contingent from kazakhstan has been filled by professional contract soldiers from the army's helicopter-borne forces . 
experts ,  however ,  doubt that astana will send troops to afghanistan . 
citing unnamed collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  sources ,  a russian newspaper reported that the treaty obligates member nations to conduct consultations with other member countries before committing their forces to military operations . 
those sources told the paper that astana has yet to initiate any consultations on the issue .

astana - east kazakhstan state university  ( eksu )  will establish a department of kazakh language and culture at the mongolian state university in accordance with the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed between the two institutions on may <num>11</num>  .
kazakhstani demographic analyst makash tatimov said almost <num>110,000</num>  ethnic kazakhs are now living in mongolia . 
eksu is the only kazakh higher education institution that has a branch in mongolia . 
until now ,  however ,  there were no opportunities for kazakhs living in the mongolian capital to study their national language and culture . 
according to the kazakhstan embassy ,  the number of kazakhs in ulan bator is as high as <num>20,000</num>  , of whom about <num>3,000</num>  are university students in the mongolian capital . 
according to aydan kurmetshi ,  an activist for the kazakh diaspora ,  the opening of a kazakh department in the mongolian capital will be a great support to kazakh young people trying to preserve their national language and culture . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  unveils emergency aid for pakistan
washington - the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  is sending us$110 million in aid to pakistan to help it cope with the refugee crisis in the north-west . 
at a white house news conference on may <num>19</num>  , secretary of state hillary clinton revealed the details of the package ,  which focuses on help for people who have fled fighting between the pakistani government and taliban . 
the money will be used to provide generators ,  tents ,  water trucks and food to some of those forced to flee . 
an initial <num>26</num>  $  million has been allocated for the immediate purchase of wheat and other food produced in pakistan itself . 
one of our guiding principles is that this should be more than just the delivery of supplies ,  clinton said . 
it should be an investment in the people of pakistan ,  so we will buy locally from the bumper crop of wheat ,  and we will work to help create quick impact job programs that will put pakistanis to work making goods for their fellow citizens . 
clinton praised the current pakistani military offensive against the taliban ,  and said she was encouraged by a national mood change on the part of the pakistani people . 
nearly <num>1</num>  million people have left their homes to escape the taliban and avoid injury ,  according to the un . 
some parts of pakistans swat valley have been emptied of their entire population . 
many of the displaced have poured into camps seeking refuge ,  and are now living in tents . 
international aid agencies have been calling for urgent and massive help to respond immediately to the crisis .

 ( reuters / fars news ) 
london - iran said it successfully tested and launched a mid-range surface-to-surface missile . 
president mahmoud ahmadinejad said the  ' sajjil-2 '  missile used  " advanced technology "  and had  " landed exactly "  on an unspecified target . 
western officials confirmed the test was for a mid-range missile and that it was successful . 
analysts say the test may have been considered as provocative by iran's arab neighbours and its opponents in the west . 
it is uncertain whether the launch was deliberately provocative ,  but the fact that it was announced by the president indicates it was probably intended as a political message ,  analysts say . 
following the iranian announcement ,  italian foreign minister franco frattini cancelled a planned trip to tehran . 
he rejected the request to meet ahmadinejad at the launch site ,  semnan ,  instead of in the capital . 
hours before his trip was to begin ,  frattini expressed  " strong regret over a lost opportunity "  to discuss iran's role in stabilising pakistan and afghanistan . 
the announcement of the launch came shortly after mahmoud ahmadinejad was confirmed as one of the four candidates cleared to stand in iran's june <num>12</num>  presidential elections . 
he will run against two leading reformers ,  former prime minister mir-hossein mousavi and ex-parliament speaker mehdi karoubi ,  and mohsen rezai ,  former chief of the revolutionary guards .

islamabad - in a sign of growing public support for the pakistani armys latest offensive against militants ,  the residents of kalam ,  a town in the swat valley ,  have taken up arms against taliban and driven them away . 
hundreds of armed people confronted about <num>50</num>  taliban fighters who tried to take control of the mountain town . 
a local official said yesterday that several militants were killed or captured after a battle lasting several hours . 
<num>50,000</num>  residents of the town ,  once an idyllic tourist mountain resort ,  are fiercely opposed to the islamists ,  who have seized a large portion of the swat valley and invaded neighbouring provinces in recent weeks . 
kalam has repulsed several taliban attacks in the past but residents say the latest clashes are the most serious . 
buoyed by the success of the military offensive against the militants in the surrounding areas ,  they vowed to resist the invaders . 
we will not allow taliban to come here ,  shamshad haqq ,  the deputy mayor of kalam ,  declared . 
residents in many other areas in swat have started forming militias to resist the taliban . 
on may <num>20</num>  , government forces seized control of the town of matta ,  a former taliban stronghold in swat and the focus of the campaign against the insurgency . 
about <num>15,000</num>  troops have been fighting an estimated <num>5,000</num>  militants in what is described by pakistani leaders as a battle for the countrys survival . 
pakistans allies pledged us$224 million in aid . 
prime minister yusuf raza gilani told a donors conference in islamabad on may <num>20</num>  that pakistan was issuing a call for help from all those who are committed to fighting terrorism .

tajikistan's least fortunate hit hardest by global financial crisis
children who have relatives living near the vakhsh district orphanage eat in their homes while the rest must make do with what is available . 
dushanbe - pupils at an orphanage school in tajikistans vakhsh district are going hungry because of cuts in rations . 
school director saifiddin valiev said the district budget provides about us$2 , 400 per month to feed the pupils . 
according to the director ,  <num>1</num>  $  per child per day is required to feed the children adequately . 
as school doctor orostamo safarova said ,  the lack of adequate food weakens the children . 
children should be provided with milk ,  butter and other products ,  which are unfortunately not included in the daily rations . 
children who have relatives near the orphanage eat in their homes ,  while the rest must content themselves with what there is here ,  she said . 
valiev said that the orphanage school was founded in <num>1993</num>  , when the number of orphans in the vakhsh valley rose steeply as a result of the civil war . 
there are now <num>266</num>  children studying at the orphanage school . 
because of a lack of beds ,  more than <num>50</num>  children have to spend nights in the homes of relatives who live in the district . 
the orphanage school is currently in the hands of the local authorities ,  who are experiencing their own difficulties . 
because of the global financial crisis ,  local companies are unable to provide humanitarian aid . 
if local authorities give us a plot of land ,  we would be able to grow our own crops and feed the children that way ,  valiev said . 
classical music maestros gather at bakhoriston

 ( photo by oliver lang / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - the tajikistan national conservatory and ministry of culture ,  with support of the soros fund ,  once again gathered a stellar group of classical music performers for the third bakhoriston international festival of professional musical arts . 
world class pianists david korevaar  ( u . s .  )  ,  vazgen vartanian and valery shkapura  ( russia )  ,  zaituna narybayeva and gulshan konyshev  ( kyrgyzstan )  ,  sergei kim  ( kazakhstan )  ,  and members of the kazakhstan and tajikistan national conservatories participated in the event . 
bakhoriston international festivals are becoming a tradition in the country's cultural life . 
experts note that the tajik capital's musical life significantly contributed to the success of the festival . 
in addition ,  the international standing of the national conservatory has noticeably increased and creative and friendly ties abroad have been strengthened by the festival . 
the festival also provided a unique opportunity for tajik conservatory students to take part in creative evenings and master classes . 
event organisers are certain that bakhoriston will have a lasting impact on both music students and professionals . 
the first bakhoriston festival was held in may <num>2007</num>  with the participation of teachers and students of the kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  uzbekistan and tajikistan national conservatories . 
in <num>2008</num>  , chamber orchestras of these countries' conservatories gathered for the festival . 
soros fund culture and art programme coordinator guland nabiyev emphasised that this unified format among various national groups is unique and was pioneered in central asia . 
the process of regulating tajik-kyrgyz border problems has been started
a joint declaration on questions concerning regulation of the border was signed in the city of khudzhand in sogdiyskiy region  ( in northern tajikistan )  by the presidents of tajikistan and kyrgyzstan ,  emomali rakhmon and kurmanbek bakiyev . 
the tajik-kyrgyz border is <num>911</num>  kilometres long . 
however ,  it is very difficult today to determine the boundaries because it has never been marked out in a significant way . 
the border is transparent ,  and in places it runs right through populated points ,  and those living in the same kishlak  ( a central asian village )  can be on opposite sides of it . 
in the densely populated regions ,  about <num>70</num>  disputed sections can be counted ,  and as a result of this conflicts arise frequently . 
the political expert parvis mullodzhanov assesses this method for conflict prevention as positive . 
the decisions have been thoroughly thought through and are aimed at eliminating the basic causes for the occurrence of conflicts along the border . 
thus ,  it has been precisely economic activity in disputed territories that has led to numerous conflicts between the populations . 
since it is impossible in the end to assign the land to either one or the other side ,  it was decided to prohibit economic use at all . 
in addition to this ,  the leaders of the republics have agreed to the creation of an inter-governmental coordinating council ,  and a council of the foreign ministries of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan . 
according to narzi ,  the creation of these two structures will be aimed at mutual coordination . 
weighing up the result of the negotiations as a whole ,  mullodzhanov believes that essentially ,  in khudzhand it was a matter of creating conditions for further strategic partnership between the two countries at the regional level . 
as is known ,  tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have similar views on questions associated with the development and distribution of water and energy resources in central asia . 
political expert <abbr>p.</abbr> 
mullodzhanov said :  for tajikistan and kyrgyzstan ,  which are capable in the near future of becoming the main exporters of electric power in central asia ,  the question of agreeing on water and energy policy is also extremely important ,  as is the process of regulating the borders . 
and the fact that this subject has now been raised is a positive move ,  for in the future it will provide an opportunity to avoid major conflict situations in expanding the water and energy resources of the whole of central asia .

 ( photo by phil walter / getty images ) 
uzbekistan - uzbek president islam karimov has approved a plan to build a national uzbek motorway that will be completed by <num>2015</num>  .
it will consist of four sections :  beineu to andijan via kungrad ,  samarkand and tashkent ;  bukhara to alat ;  bukhara to termez via karshi and guzar ;  and samarkand to guzar . 
the total length of the motorway will be <num>1,501</num>  kilometer  . 
financing for its construction will be provided by international financial institutions and loans from the uzbek reconstruction and development fund . 
at the end of this year there will be a tender for six mobile asphalt paving units . 
the plan also includes creating production facilities for modern synthetic polymers used in road construction by the end of <num>2009</num>  .
in addition ,  roadside infrastructure and service facilities will be developed along the motorway including motels ,  campsites ,  petrol stations and repair shops . 
the uzbek cabinet of ministers has been tasked with preparing the roadside infrastructure development plan and identifying specific investors and sources of financing by <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
according to preliminary calculations ,  the construction of the motorway will allow international and transit freight traffic through uzbekistan to double ,  while domestic freight and passenger transit within the country will rise by <num>60</num>  to <num>70</num>  percent . 
currently the total length of auto roads in uzbekistan is <num>146,400</num>  kilometer  and <num>20</num>  international transport routes pass through the country . 
leading reformist iranian presidential candidate mir hossein mousavi leaves at the conclusion of his press conference in tehran ,  iran may <num>29</num>  .
 ( ap photo / vahid salemi ) 
tehran - irans leading moderate candidate mir hossein mousavi said may <num>29</num>  he would continue talks with major powers on his countrys disputed nuclear activities if he won the june presidential election . 
if elected as irans president ,  i will continue nuclear talks with the p5+1 group ,  mousavi told a news conference when he was asked about ahmadinejads rejection of such talks . 
the p5+1 group of countries said in april they would invite iran to a meeting in an effort to find a diplomatic solution to the row . 
hoping to win votes from reformers and conservatives ,  the former prime minister derided ahmadinejad's foreign policy ,  saying he will adopt a conciliatory policy towards the west unlike his  " extremist "  rival who seeks re-election in june . 
mousavi ,  who served as prime minister during iran's <num>1980</num> -<num>88</num>  war with iraq ,  is backed by many moderates like former president mohammad khatami and some conservatives in the contest . 
a senior western diplomat told reuters on may <num>29</num>  that ahmadinejad's comments have disappointed the major powers that are trying to engage iran diplomatically to end the standoff . 
 " we want to see a positive sign from iran and rejecting nuclear talks altogether is not a positive sign at all "  ,  said the diplomat ,  who asked not to be named . 
while stressing his belief in preserving iran's national interests ,  mousavi said the islamic state should be ready for talks with the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  if washington policy toward iran changed .

first human rights commissioner ,  or ombudsman ,  appointed in tajikistan
the decree by the president of tajikistan appointing zarif alizod to the post of human rights commissioner on his web site . 
 ( image from www . 
his candidacy for the position was proposed by president emomali rahmon . 
the presidents press office announced the same day that rahmon signed the decree appointing alizod as ombudsman that alizod had stepped down from his position as presidential advisor on legal policy and the presidents authorised representative in parliament . 
political analyst rashid gani abdullo said alizods appointment was unexpected because many thought former deputy justice minister gulchehra sharipova ,  who also headed the presidential administrations department of constitutional human rights guarantees ,  would get the job . 
abdullo ,  however ,  believes alizod is no less worthy a candidate given that he was the head of tajikistans constitutional court for three years . 
abdullo believes that creating the position of ombudsman was essential but was motivated by an urge to imitate more advanced countries on the issue of human rights . 
in post-soviet countries such as tajikistan ,  experience has shown that authoritarian presidential power ,  which is common to all of them ,  hampers the establishment of the institution of ombudsman . 
international organisations say up to <num>25,000</num>  kyrgyz residents use narcotics intravenously . 
 ( photo by str new  /  reuters ) 
kyrgyzstan - drug addiction and toxicomania are growing problems in kyrgyzstan . 
increased demand for narcotics is giving the drug mafia greater influence and increasing drug trafficking ,  said parliamentarian damira niyazaliyeva during a recently held roundtable on the spread of hiv and drug addiction in kyrgyzstan . 
the government believes the solution is to support the expansion of the methadone replacement therapy programme . 
according to the kyrgyz healthcare ministry narcotics centre ,  at the beginning of the year the country had more than <num>9,000</num>  drug addicts ,  approximately <num>70</num>  percent of whom use intravenous drugs . 
more than half of the <num>532</num>  new hiv patients in the country are also drug addicts ,  said head of the national narcotics centre ruslan tokubayev . 
international organisations have different figures . 
some reports contend the country has as many as <num>26,000</num>  drug addicts ,  <num>25,000</num>  of whom use intravenous drugs . 
the conflicting statistics did not prevent unicef representative to kyrgyzstan timothy shaffter from praising the governments efforts to fight drug addiction . 
he said kyrgyzstans effective policy could serve as an example to other countries in the region . 
the country conducts a programme to provide free hypodermic needles to drug addicts as well as a methadone replacement programme . 
last year ,  drug addicts received more than <num>4</num>  million free hypodermic needles . 
kyrgyzstan has <num>54</num>  sites where the needles can be exchanged ,  including <num>11</num>  inside prisons . 
under the methadone replacement programme ,  <num>17</num>  sites have been setup for drug addicts ,  <num>14</num>  operated by the healthcare ministry and three inside prisons . 
talgat subanbekov ,  the head of the global fund to fight hiv / aids ,  tuberculosis and malaria ,  said the fund would continue to finance the kyrgyz government so it can purchase the methadone it needs for the programme . 
kyrgyzstan applied to join in the fourth round of our programmes for additional financing . 
i think kyrgyzstan will get the help it needs in this area for the next <num>10</num>  - <num>15</num>  years ,  he said . 
getting into prison in tajikistan is easy ,  but not for everyone
tajikistan human rights workers are concerned about the lack of regular access to places of detention by international and local observers . 
 ( photo by kirill kudryvtsev / afp / getty images ) 
tajikistan - an international seminar titled independent access to closed tajikistan institutions and experiences of other countries was held in dushanbe at the end of <abbr>may.</abbr> 
representatives of the presidents office ,  the judicial establishment ,  local and international ngos ,  and human rights lawyers and experts took part in the event . 
in <num>2006</num>  , the un committee against torture examined a report on tajikistans implementation of the convention against torture ,  after which the committee expressed concern regarding the lack of systematic oversight and regular access for international and local observers to places of detention . 
representatives of human rights organisations and legal experts believe the time has come for tajikistan to ratify the optional protocol which obligates a country to create a body to monitor and prevent torture in closed facilities . 
tatyana khatyukhina ,  an attorney at the ngo centre for human rights ,  noted that conditions of incarceration in tajikistan's correctional institutions do not comply with international standards and are ,  as such ,  inhumane . 
in addition ,  in her opinion the lack of contact with the outside world applies not only to jails ,  but to induction stations as well . 
deputy director of the ministry of justice correctional affairs directorate bakhrom abdulkhakov contends that access to institutions under the authority of the ministry of justice is not limited . 
according to him ,  about <num>18</num>  international and local organisations visit them as part of their programmes . 
there are currently <num>9,000</num>  prisoners incarcerated in tajikistan's places of detention . 
the international red cross committee has not had access to any of them since <num>2004</num>  .
tajikistan to expand military cooperation with kazakhstan ,  russia
dushanbe - on may <num>28</num>  , tajikistan president emomali rakhmon and kazakhstan minister of defence daniyal akhmetov discussed bilateral and regional military issues . 
they also considered the current situation in afghanistan and the outlook for its development . 
according to the presidents press office ,  rakhmon was satisfied with the current level of bilateral cooperation . 
akhmetov said the two sides worked out a firm agreement on tajik armed forces units participating in training exercises with kazakh units . 
he noted that kazakhstan military personnel took part in the norak anti-terror <num>2009</num>  command-and-staff exercises in april at the fahrabad scientific centre range in tajikistan . 
akhmetov said that crucial aspects of cooperation involve military training and the exchange of information in the field of military-technical cooperation ,  primarily within the framework of the collective security treaty organisation and the collective rapid response force . 
according to his statement ,  kazakhstan will make every effort to establish closer relations with tajikistan . 
in addition ,  of all the former soviet union countries ,  tajikistan is now the most active in developing its military cooperation with russia . 
tajikistan was the only central asian nation that received almost nothing from the former soviet armys division of property . 
because of this ,  russia took an active part in establishing tajikistans national security agencies after it gained independence . 
russian-tajik military cooperation peaked during tajikistans <num>1992</num> -<num>1997</num>  civil war . 
russia is now transferring the military technology and ammunition of the 201st russian military base to tajikistan stage by stage . 
the tajikistan and russian ministries of defence are also considering the possibility of creating a regional centre to repair and modernise armoured vehicles and artillery systems in the central asian country . 
pakistan intensifies fight to eradicate polio
a child is administered a polio drop in islamabad . 
srinagar - a three-day nationwide polio immunisation programme in pakistan aimed at eradicating the crippling virus from the country concluded successfully may <num>31</num>  .
the oral vaccine was given to more than <num>33</num>  million children under the age of five by <num>86,000</num>  teams that administered the vaccine and vitamin a drops as they went door-to-door across the country to fulfil their mission . 
the current anti-polio campaign provided an opportunity to reach out to children who have not earlier been vaccinated for security reasons in swat and other restive areas ,  said health minister aijaz hussain jakhrani . 
before the armys counter-taliban security operation ,  tens of thousands of children in northern areas were not vaccinated . 
tribal leaders opposed vaccination campaigns because propaganda unleashed among the community claimed polio immunisations turned children sterile . 
pakistan ranks just below nigeria and india on the list of countries where polio continues to thrive . 
according to the data maintained by global polio eradication initiative <num>17</num>  , new polio cases continue to be reported in the country . 
last year the number of people infected with polio was <num>117</num>  .

dushanbe - on may <num>30</num>  , <num>11</num>  members of hizb ut-tahrir were arrested by the sogdiisk regional public prosecutors department of organised crime control . 
according to independent expert abdullo kurbonov ,  banned religious movements such as hizb ut-tahrir are using the current world financial crisis to strengthen their positions and influence ,  taking advantage of the fact that of tajikistans population of <num>7</num>  million ,  <num>2</num>  million able-bodied citizens aged <num>15</num>  to <num>60</num>  do not have steady jobs . 
according to supreme court presiding judge nusratullo abdulloyev ,  criminal proceedings were instituted against <num>28</num>  members of hizb ut-tahrir in <num>2008</num>  .
the movement was banned in tajikistan in <num>2001</num>  and designated as extremist in <num>2008</num>  .
in addition ,  activities of the jehovahs witnesses christian sect were banned in <num>2008</num>  and ,  at the beginning of this year ,  activities of the salafiya islamic movement were also ruled illegal . 
the training is being conducted by the osce research centre at the university of hamburg in germany and the viennese institute for peace and security policy . 
the kazakh diplomats will acquaint themselves with osce's political ,  military ,  economic and ecological activities ,  human resources policies ,  the obligations of countries holding the osce chair and the roles of osce member states in its activities . 
during the training ,  the diplomats will also attend a meeting of the osce's permanent council . 
 " development of tajikistan's oil and gas industry " 
tajikistans minister of energy and industry ,  sherali gul
this is what zumrat gaybullaeva ,  head of the ministry of energy and industrys department of international affairs ,  recently told journalists . 
once tethys has recovered its outlay on the development of these gas fields and is able to concentrate exclusively on extracting gas ,  production will be divided on a <num>50</num>  / <num>50</num>  basis ,  he commented . 
tajik experts believe that major investment in the development of the countrys barely accessible gas fields means tajikistan can count on increasing its energy independence . 
in the words of the head of the department of the regional economy ,  kholnazar mukhabatov ,  the results of geological explorations could improve the countrys situation in terms of its oil and gas reserves . 
the commercial development of tajikistan's energy resources demands considerable amounts of capital because its hydrocarbon deposits are found so far beneath the surface . 
tajikistan's ministry of energy and industry estimates that the volume of gas in the republic's fields is <num>3</num>  trillion cubic metres . 
but at present ,  tajikistan is itself forced to purchase almost all the gas it uses from neighbouring state ,  uzbekistan . 
according to the tajik state statistics committee ,  between january and may <num>2008</num>  natural gas imports from neighbouring uzbekistan came to <num>255,900,000</num>  cubic metres which cost the country <num>37</num>  $  million . 
compared with the same period in <num>2007</num>  , this represented a cost increase of <num>24.4</num>  per cent and a decrease in volume of <num>7.4</num>  per cent . 
at the beginning of this year the volume of natural gas being extracted inside the country came to a little over <num>50,000,000</num>  cubic metres . 
over the last three years ,  prices for imported gas from uzbekistan have begun increasing by <num>50</num>  per cent a year . 
in <num>2008</num>  , according to agreements between the parties ,  the tariff for imported gas is <num>145</num>  $  per thousand cubic metres . 
the general director of the state monopoly tajikgaz ,  fatkhiddin mukhsiddinov ,  comments that ,  from the beginning of <num>2009</num>  , uzbekistan also intends to sell gas to neighbouring countries - at european rates in some cases . 
this means that next year gas prices per thousand cubic metres will reach at least <num>300</num>  $  .
saidov believes that such measures will not only reduce tajikistan's dependence on neighbouring countries for its gas ,  but will also allow it to become a future gas exporter . 
this is all the more likely given that initial information suggests the republic's oil and gas prospective reserves are relatively substantial .

tajikistan - a <num>10</num> -day campaign to provide vitamins to children began in tajikistan on june <num>10</num>  .
deputy healthcare minister azam mirzoyev said the campaign is designed to prevent vitamin deficiency in children and mothers after birth . 
local doctors and unicef employees will provide vitamin a to women and children under the age of six . 
head of the unicef office in tajikistan khongwei gao said <num>52</num>  percent of tajik children suffer from vitamin deficiency and <num>27</num>  percent suffer from malnutrition . 
about seven percent of the children have a severe form of hypotrophy ,  which weakens their immune systems . 
according to the head of the department for aid to mothers ,  children ,  and family planning at the healthcare ministry sherali rakhmatulloyev ,  a lack of vitamin a can make some childhood illnesses fatal . 
he said if vitamin a is used to boost immunity ,  infant and child mortality can be prevented in half of the cases . 
the world health organisation has sponsored a campaign to fight helminthism in children age two to six . 
efforts have been conducted in <num>37</num>  regions affecting children in grades one through four so far this year . 
another campaign will be conducted for children up to <num>14</num>  years of age . 
first deputy healthcare minister said dzhobirov said infant and mother mortality in tajikistan is very high . 
official figures show the fatality rate for mothers was <num>40.9</num>  per <num>100</num>  newborns in <num>2008</num>  , compared with <num>33.2</num>  per <num>100</num>  in <num>2005</num>  .
dzhobirov said the official figures are not a true representation . 
she said improving the economy by reducing poverty and restructuring and modernising social programmes set the conditions for improving healthcare services and consequently the health of the population . 
tajikistan invests in beekeeping
dushanbe - tajik authorities intend to increase national production of high-quality pure honey to <num>6,000</num>  tonnes per year . 
muzafar halimov ,  the director of asali tochiyu  ( tajik honey )  ,  the state beekeeping company run by the tajik ministry of agriculture ,  has announced that a <num>2006</num> -<num>2010</num>  national beekeeping development programme has been adopted and is now being implemented . 
as part of the programme ,  efforts will be made to increase the number of bee colonies and breeds and to expand production . 
halimov also said that the number of bee colonies in the country increased to <num>135,000</num>  in <num>2008</num>  from <num>118,000</num>  in <num>2007</num>  .
what made the growth in honey production and the increase in the number of bee colonies in <num>2008</num>  possible was the acquisition from russia of a new breed - carpathian bees . 
this breed ,  which has produced more than <num>2,000</num>  tonnes of high-quality natural mountain honey in the country ,  has proven more productive than other species . 
for instance ,  one colony of carpathian bees produces more than <num>15</num>  kilograms of honey per year ;  five kilograms more than what is produced by the local breeds most common in tajikistan and caucasian bees . 
to increase the number of carpathian bees ,  the ministry of agriculture is planning to set aside six hectares of land for apiaries in the varzob gorge . 
to develop the sector ,  us$57 , 000 will be allocated to it in the <num>2009</num>  budget ,  halimov noted . 
halimov also said that tajikistan has more than <num>5</num>  million hectares of mountainous territory ,  which is ideal for beekeeping and honey production . 
given the variety of flora ,  and the climate and characteristics of the mountains in tajikistan ,  increasing the number of bee colonies in the country to <num>800,000</num>  should be possible . 
rights groups seek end to child labour in pakistan
thousands of children across pakistan work in hard ,  sometimes dangerous ,  conditions to earn money for their families . 
they labour in factories ,  brick kilns ,  car shops ,  hotels ,  roadside restaurants and as domestic help . 
it is imperative for the government to implement laws that ban children from working under  [ dangerous ]  conditions and  [ below ]  a certain age ,  said sparc executive director qindeel shujaat . 
society also needs to be made aware that child labour is not an answer to the problem of poverty ,  he added . 
other rights groups advocate making primary education compulsory in the country . 
punjab announced a major project for eradicating bonded labour in brick-kilns across punjab at a cost of us$1 . 5 million ,  said punjab government labour secretary abdul rauf khan . 
around <num>11,000</num>  children of brick-kiln families will be provided education through this project and the kilns will be provided interest free small loans to eliminate their debts . 
additionally ,  the pakistan government has initiated other protection programmes and has ,  with the help of international agencies ,  succeeded in removing nearly <num>93</num>  percent of the child labour from the football manufacturing industry of sialkot . 
their support was instrumental in having more than <num>70,000</num>  children removed from illegal work environments . 
while that is a substantial number ,  according to unicef statistics an estimated <num>218</num>  million children aged <num>5</num> -<num>17</num>  are engaged in child labour around the world . 
in addition ,  a sparc report titled the state of pakistans children <num>2008</num>  released on june <num>12</num>  states that <num>6,780</num>  cases of violence involving sexual abuse ,  targeted murders ,  abductions ,  forced labour ,  suicides and child trafficking were reported during <num>2008</num>  .
models of economic development for tajikistan
the government of tajikistan is implementing a programme entitled national strategy for developing the republic of tajikistan until <num>2015</num>   ( the nsd <num>2015</num>  )  in order to accelerate the transition to market relations and the development of the national economy . 
this is what amonullo ashur ,  the first deputy minister of economic development said . 
independent economist khodzhimukhammad umarov
despite the fact that for several consecutive years now annual economic growth has been <num>7</num>  percent per year ,  this indicator still only amounts to <num>70</num>  percent of the <num>1991</num>  figure . 
nuriddin kayumov ,  the director of the ministry of economic and developments institute for economic studies ,  believes that the success of the programme ,  which covers the development of all sectors of the national economy ,  depends on financing and attracting investment . 
according to calculations done by tajik experts ,  the implementation of the nsd <num>2015</num>  will require more than <num>13</num>  $  billion  [ usd ]  . 
as of today ,  only <num>45</num>  percent of the funding sources have been identified . 
first deputy minister of economic development and trade amonullo ashur
the way out of this situation may be to create favourable conditions for attracting investments ,  establishing the production of industrial output ,  developing hydropower and agriculture ,  and balancing the foreign trade turnover ,  where imports are at present much greater than exports . 
without these measures ,  by <num>2015</num>  the <num>1991</num>  level of output growth will not have been achieved in the development of the economy ,  umarov said . 
it is ashurs opinion that the new version of the law on investments ,  which was passed in <num>2007</num>  , contains provisions which offer various advantages to both home and foreign investors . 
in particular ,  an investor will be exempt from payment of eight kinds of taxes  ( including value added tax for imported technological equipment )  . 
umarov notes that in order to correct the situation it is necessary to devise and adopt a programme to import replacement goods . 
this step will make it possible to provide the home market with its own products . 
the first deputy minister of economic development and trade ,  amonullo ashir ,  said a specially created group of experts is working on an import replacement programme . 
the relevant ministries and state bodies have been tasked with this . 
according to figures from the ministry of economic development and trade ,  certain parts of nsd <num>2015</num>  are already being implemented . 
in particular ,  this applies to the components of the programme dealing with reducing the number of poor people in the country ,  increasing economic growth ,  giving land to farmers ,  and improving the living standards of citizens . 
livestock must be raised on organic feed under the halal standard .

astana - the ngo halal industry ,  which includes <num>400</num>  producers of halal products ,  held a congress in kazakhstan on june <num>12</num>  that drew businessmen from russias muslim republics chechnya and tatarstan ,  kyrgyzstan and tajikistan . 
halal products for muslims conform to sharia law . 
halal meat is produced in strict compliance with the procedure for slaughtering animals and meat processing . 
animals must be raised on organic feed . 
halal standards are similar to kosher requirements that do not allow the consumption of port ,  the meat of a cloven-hoofed animal . 
halal industry chairman marat sarsenbayev said halal products have established a place in the kazakh market and have good growth potential . 
kazakhstan adopted a national standard for halal products in <num>2006</num>  , and many butchers and meat packing plants have already switched to its standards . 
the impression that only muslim nations produce halal food is refuted by major meat suppliers like brazil and argentina complying with halal standards . 
sarsenbayev said the number of counterfeit products is rising in kazakhstan as halal products become more popular . 
the fake products usually do not provide accurate producer information . 
an agreement was signed with the national biotechnology centre to conduct research to test the quality of products entering the kazakh market that are marketed as halal compliant . 
the opening of the islamic bank in kazakhstan under an agreement reached with the uae government will have a positive influence on the growth of halal products . 
interest free loans provided by the bank will contribute significantly to the development of the industry in the country ,  according to sarsenbayev .

dushanbe - following his meeting with tajikistan president emomali rakhmon on june <num>17</num>  , international monetary fund  ( imf )  managing director dominique strauss-kahn said that if the republic is able to fulfil it agreements with the imf and adhere to planned target budget figures ,  the fund will consider increasing financial aid to the nation . 
tajikistan has suffered more from the effects of the world financial crisis than other central asian countries . 
he also positively assessed the anti-crisis measures taken by the republics government . 
strauss-kahn visited tajikistan during his tour of central asian countries . 
in april ,  the imf approved a us$120 . 5 million three-year anti-crisis credit programme for tajikistan with the provision that the amount may be increased if dushanbe carries out planned reforms . 
additionally ,  the world bank this year allocated us$20 million and the asian development bank us$120 million to support the tajikistan economy . 
furthermore ,  the european bank of reconstruction and development allocated another <num>50</num>  $  million to support the republics commercial banks . 
at the same time ,  strauss-kahn warned that dushanbe may have to postpone priority investment projects until economic recovery begins . 
currently ,  the most important investment project is the construction of the rogunsk hydroelectric power plant ,  which tajikistan hopes will solve its winter energy shortages . 
while tajikistans gdp increased by <num>3.2</num>  percent in annual terms between january and may this year ,  there was a <num>13</num>  percent drop in industrial production ,  and the imf now forecasts only two percent total gdp growth for this year . 
strauss-kahn predicted the global situation would improve by the end of the year and said the imf expects to see growth in the world economy resume next year . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama's remarks on iran
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama gestures at a white house news conference june <num>23</num>  .
 ( reuters / jason reed ) 
editor's note :  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president barack obama held the first afternoon press conference of his presidency on june <num>23</num>  at the white house . 
president obama :  i'd like to say a few words about the situation in iran . 
the united states and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats ,  the beatings and imprisonments of the last few days . 
i strongly condemn these unjust actions ,  and i join with the american people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost . 
i've made it clear that the united states respects the sovereignty of the islamic republic of iran and is not interfering with iran's affairs . 
the iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future . 
some in iran -- some in the iranian government ,  in particular ,  are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the united states and others in the west of instigating protests over the elections . 
these accusations are patently false . 
they're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within iran's borders . 
this is what we've witnessed . 
we've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of iranians marching in silence . 
we've seen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their voices are heard . 
as i said in cairo ,  suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . 
the iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech . 
if the iranian government seeks the respect of the international community ,  it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people .

 ( photo by shah marai / afp / getty images ) 
on june <num>19</num>  , the abuali ibn sino tajik state medical university announced that it will allocate five places to students from afghanistan and award them free tuition . 
training for healthcare workers is very important for afghanistan because of the poor epidemiological situation in the country . 
much of the population has no access to qualified healthcare professionals ,  and the continuing military conflict is increasing the need for doctors and other healthcare workers . 
approximately <num>500</num>  students from <num>17</num>  countries around the world are currently studying at the abuali ibn sino tajik state medical university ,  <num>75</num>  of whom are from afghanistan . 
the number of young afghans being educated in other fields in dushanbe is also rising . 
by way of comparison ,  five years ago there were just <num>50</num>  afghans studying in tajikistan . 
observers ,  however ,  cite a potential problem . 
in recent years ,  the tajik authorities have increasingly clamped down on visible signs of religious affiliation at institutes of higher education . 
on one occasion ,  four muslim students were excluded from the tajik state university for wearing the hijab ,  a headdress which is traditional for women in afghanistan to wear . 
the vice-chancellor of the university ruled that expelled students failed to comply with the universitys dress code . 
pakistan planning cargo train service to iran and turkey
karachi - railways minister ghulam ahmed bilour said on june <num>24</num>  that pakistan railway is planning an international freight service to iran and turkey this summer to improve trade with those countries . 
the cargo train iranian station  [ is ]  where the goods will be shifted onto iranian trains for transport to other destinations in iran and to turkey ,  bilour said . 
initially the train will carry consignments from karachi and lahore ,  but at a later stage this cargo service could also be offered to businessmen in faisalabad and multan cities ,  bilour said . 
faisalabad was proposed by pakistan dry ports association  ( pdpa )  chairman sheikh ashfaq ahmed as a city to be included in the route of international cargo train service to accommodate textile consignments for export . 
small and medium exporters association chairman zulfiqar thaver said cargo train service between pakistan and iraq and turkey will be extremely beneficial for the nations exporters . 
currently ,  the value of pakistans trade with iran and turkey amounts to about us$1 billion per year ,  which the launch of an international cargo train service could increase by as much as <num>50</num>  percent ,  he added .

karachi - the multinational corporations  ( mncs )  operating in pakistan reported a <num>14</num>  percent decline in the repatriation of their profit to home organisations in <num>11</num>  months of fy <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  .
the repatriation of profit by mncs is a key indicator of their financial and business performance ,  pearl capital ceo saad naseer said . 
between july <num>2008</num>  and last may ,  mncs operating in pakistan repatriated us$728 million . 
according to president of the swiss business council farhat ali ,  only mncs in food ,  oil refining ,  fertiliser manufacturing ,  electrical machinery and power generation reported increases in profit repatriation . 
as president of pakistan automobile dealers association shahzad ahmed said ,  automobile production and sales dropped by <num>40</num> -<num>45</num>  percent ,  which reduced or perhaps even eliminated profits of some companies in that sector . 
since financial year <num>2007</num>  , the foreign companies in pakistan have sent abroad an impressive amount of <num>2.5</num>  $  billion worth of profit . 
despite the global economic slowdown and critical law and order situation in the north-west frontier province ,  the overall performance of the foreign companies was satisfactory in <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  .
in <num>11</num>  months of fy <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  , pakistan received <num>3.3</num>  $  billion foreign direct investment while the annual target had been fixed at <num>4</num>  $  billion . 
english language is hugely popular
a few years ago ,  knowledge of the english language was required primarily by international organizations operating in kyrgyzstan . 
today virtually everyone is learning english . 
according to polls conducted by sociological services ,  the english language is one of the most popular foreign languages in the country ,  despite the fact that in recent years there has also been active development of french ,  german ,  and chinese . 
experts from the kyrgyz republic ministry of education and culture also note the contribution from the peace corps and the popularisation of english in the country . 
english is very popular in kyrgyzstan because the activity of the peace corps is not restricted to the capital . 
they are working in many parts of the country ,  including the distant parts ,  says adiba abdulayeva ,  an expert from the osh city department of education . 
the programme will begin the english lessons in the chuysk and batkensk districts at the base of the american corner in kant and at the city childrens library in kyzylkiye . 
eight teachers have been selected on the basis of a competition that was announced in december <num>2007</num>  .
the forum association is conducting training for these teachers . 
the best of the best will have an opportunity to participate in a three-week training course in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  during the summer of <num>2008</num>  .
taking into account the summer holidays ,  provision has also been made to organise a summer camp where students will be able to consolidate their language skills .

a total of <num>150</num>  small hydroelectric power plants have been built in tajikistan since independence in <num>1990</num>  .
kurbonov said that mini power plants have proven effective in settlements in mountainous regions that are not connected to the national grid ,  and they are inexpensive to maintain . 
the tajik government also plans to build more medium-sized hydroelectric power plants . 
with the help of chinese ,  iranian and russian companies ,  a number of projects for plants with capacities between <num>220</num> -<num>650</num>  mw are already being implemented .

kazakhstan opens locomotive engine assembly plant
currently almost <num>400</num>  antiquated and worn out locomotives on kazakhstans railroads need to be replaced . 
 ( photo by natalia kolsenikova / afp / getty images ) 
astana - on july <num>3</num>  , president nursultan nazarbayev participated in the opening ceremony for the first kazakh locomotive engine assembly plant in astana . 
ge board of directors chairman jeffrey immelt asserted that one of the factors that led to the companys decision to invest in kazakhstan was the countrys prominent geo-political position in one of the fastest developing regions in the world . 
currently almost <num>400</num>  locomotive engines on the countrys railways need to be replaced . 
the factory will assemble locomotives and their engines using western technology ,  taking into account a different rail gauge and technical specifications that exceed those of the engines being used today . 
investors are banking on demand for the factorys product not only in kazakhstan and russia but in uzbekistan ,  turkmenistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and mongolia as well . 
the capacity of the kazakhstan railroad market is substantial . 
there are <num>14,000</num>  kilometres of railway tracks in the country ,  and because population centres are far apart from each other ,  there is a high volume of railway transport . 
experts believe that the future of the new plant will hinge on the demand generated abroad based on how well it fills the demands of kazakhstans railways . 
anti-taliban leader murdered in pakistan

 ( ap photo / shakil adil ) 
peshawar - a pakistani tribal elder who was raising a militia against the taliban has been killed in the latest attack against figures opposing the islamist rebels . 
he was organising a tribal militia against the taliban and was consulting other tribal elders ,  khattak said . 
in june ,  rising anti-mehsud tribal leader qari zainuddin was assassinated ,  in an apparent attempt by the taliban to eliminate rivals and critics . 
one of mehsuds men claimed responsibility for the zainuddin killing ,  warning :   " anyone who works against us will face the same fate .  " 
tashkent - one of the most ambitious projects in the history of tashkent has ground to a halt and is now in danger of failing entirely . 
instead of commissioning the first skyscrapers of the ultra-modern tashkent city district ,  investors and builders are now embroiled in a legal wrangle in a commercial court . 
the uzbek media only recently hailed it as the project of the century ,  a new city of banks ,  hospitals ,  offices and luxury homes on <num>79</num>  hectares in the city centre currently encumbered by dilapidated privately owned buildings of the old city . 
the projects13 building contractors have already spent a total of us$28 . 5 million . 
the first three storeys of a seven-storey block of flats in sergeli have been built ,  and work has also begun on a school ,  a nursery and a shop . 
a hundred lots have been partly connected to utilities ,  but most of sergeli and the site of the future tashkent city are covered with nothing more than foundation trenches . 
old tashkent abandoned homes . 
money has run out and work has come to a standstill . 
experts say the koreans were irate because the project was implemented poorly by the uzbek design institute and the necessary financing was accurately estimated . 
one the <num>13</num>  contractors ,  osu-4 ,  incurred a loss of us$485 , 000 and is now suing jisong korea industrial . 
daehan offered the firm a pig farm near tashkent by way of compensation . 
the other contractors are hoping to receive a share in a high-rise building in the capital owned by the koreans . 
it appears as if the story of new tashkent has reached its end .

after going through years of struggle ,  women in afghanistan ,  such as fatima ,  finally feel free . 
the rise of female education needs to be encouraged and written about by journalists . 
women need to feel that society is supporting their development ,  she said . 
farhana ,  a photo journalist ,  added that there are still many young girls and women in society who do not go to school or work and who face societal limitations . 
she said that more media attention needs to be drawn to women working and doing jobs traditionally done by men in order to help break cultural stereotypes . 
i have a lot of confidence in my ability and the people i work with recognise that . 
initially i faced many problems . 
people were often surprised when they first saw a woman photographer but when they saw the quality of my work ,  all that changed ,  she said .

dushanbe - more than <num>3,200</num>  religious groups and organisations in tajikistan will have to re-register with authorities by the end of this year in accordance with the law on freedom of conscience and religious groups that was passed last april . 
organisations that fail to re-register by the deadline will lose their status as legal entities and their registration certificates will be deemed invalid . 
i think nine months is a sufficient period in which to gather together the necessary documents and go through the re-registration procedure ,  said head of the ministry of cultures religious groups department saidbek makhmadulloyev . 
the new law prohibits the involvement of minors in the activities of religious organisations and also stipulates that parents or guardians must give their consent for children to receive a religious education . 
the law also bans campaigning and the dissemination of information by religious groups in state-run educational institutions and on privately owned premises . 
these provisions were adopted to curb the spread of radical islam in tajikistan . 
independent experts have repeatedly pointed out that the law contains provisions restricting legitimate activities of religious groups and freedom of conscience .

more than twenty local afghan women recently met with usaid representatives to find ways to improve living conditions for women in nurgram ,  in nuristan province . 
the women presented a list of their priorities ,  including electricity ,  clean water ,  literacy courses ,  and midwife training .

a local contractor will soon begin work on a further micro-hydro station that will provide power for nurgram district . 
clean water is also a priority and the prt is constructing a well in nangarej village . 
nuristans remote location means that fewer aid agencies are able to extend their development efforts there . 
but despite the challenges ,  the afghan government and several ngos are reaching out to help . 
the women of nuristan are intelligent and talented ,  and they have good experience with handicrafts ,  such as weaving . 
we are trying to find a good market for their products . 
usaid is implementing an assistance program in nuristan that includes small projects focused on women ,  such as a wool-weaving project and an educational radio show that includes interviews with women farmers .

national anti-polio programme manager dr altaf bosan said that last year <num>118</num>  polio cases were detected in the country ,  and that the government was committed to eradicating the polio virus as soon as possible . 
he said cooperation extended by the education ministry ,  city police ,  mobile phone companies and media was commendable . 
kazakhstan facing water shortages in the south despite accords with its neighbours
kazakhstan had earlier agreed with kyrgyzstan to receive ,  for its cotton fields ,  <num>600</num>  million cubic metres of water from toktogul in return for buying ,  from kyrgyzstan ,  <num>500</num>  million kwh of electricity generated by the toktogul hydropower station when the water is released . 
according to the accords reached ,  this water should transit through uzbekistan without hindrance . 
in this respect we have reached a fundamental accord :  as much water as is received from toktogul will go along the syr darya to kazakhstan ,  shukeyev told journalists after the negotiations . 
kazakhstan receives water from the syr darya through the dostyk  ( friendship )  canal which originates in uzbekistan . 
in order to satisfy kazakh cotton farmers demand for irrigation water the canal would need to carry at least <num>80</num>  cubic metres of water per second ;  however ,  it is currently carrying only <num>20</num>  cubic metres per second . 
the reasons for the current water shortages in the region are the dry spring and summer and the inability of the four central asian countries located on the syr darya river - kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan ,  uzbekistan and kazakhstan - to come to terms on the use of the rivers water . 
the water shortage in turn has led to a decrease in water releases by kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and subsequently uzbekistan ,  reported bakhtiyar bakas uulu ,  an analyst at the almaty-based institute for economic strategies - central asia . 
the problem is that the upper-stream countries ,  kyrgyzstan and tajikistan ,  regard water as a source of energy in winter ,  while the lower-stream countries ,  uzbekistan and kazakhstan ,  need water in spring and summer for irrigation . 
this problem can be solved by kazakhstan supplying coal and uzbekistan supplying gas to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan in return for their agreeing to save water in their reservoirs in winter and release it during the irrigation period . 
however ,  the way that regional countries use energy supplies and water as political instruments to pursue their national interests is complicating the problem and preventing a deal from being reached ,  as it has since <num>1993</num>  when kyrgyzstan first started using water for power generation in winter . 
the difference in the countries approaches to solving the water issue is also making it impossible to hold a dialogue on water amongst them . 
an approach based on contract terms of international documents and agreements can serve precisely as a good example for us peacefully attaining proper access to water for the entire population of central asia ,  the chairman of the kazakh agriculture ministrys water resources committee ,  anatoliy ryabtsev ,  told the forum . 
since kazakhstan accesses syr darya water last among its neighbours ,  it has long been advocating the establishment of a pentalateral central asian water consortium to regulate water issues in the region . 
however ,  the absence of a common understanding of these problems has dragged this issue out for many years . 
this has forced kazakhstan to try to solve its water problems unilaterally by planning to construct ,  over the next three years ,  the koksaray reservoir in the countrys south to accumulate water released by kyrgyzstan in winter ,  prevent flooding in spring ,  and use this water for irrigation in summer . 
however ,  the new reservoir may not solve the irrigation water problem in kazakhstan ,  bakas uulu believes . 
it will be filled only in cases of unexpected releases of water by kyrgyzstan . 
if there are no such releases ,  the reservoir will not accumulate water ,  and ,  therefore ,  it will not be used for agricultural needs ,  he said . 
pakistani expert addresses punjabs sanitation problem
islamabad - the problems with waste disposal in punjab exemplify the need for policies to protect pakistans population ,  especially children ,  from chronic diseases caused by exposure to human waste ,  in particular . 
that was the point made by chief of water supply and sanitation in punjabs planning and development department chaudhry karamat at a seminar on july <num>22</num>  .
he outlined the need for safe and effective disposal of solid ,  liquid and human wastes ,  the accumulation of which is undermining the quality of life in punjab . 
the unsafe and ineffective disposal of human waste ,  in particular ,  has caused disease and many social problems that result in poverty ,  illiteracy and underdevelopment . 
only <num>58</num>  percent of the countrys population has access to proper sanitation facilities ;  the remaining <num>42</num>  percent relieve themselves in the open ,  which creates serious risks of exposure to a variety of diseases ,  the expert argued . 
according to karamats analysis ,  the <num>20</num>  districts of punjab have less than <num>60</num>  percent sanitation coverage ,  with eight districts falling below <num>40</num>  percent coverage . 
almost half of all households lack toilets connected to any sewage system and therefore use open drains ,  or underground septic tanks . 
the bottom line is that only <num>15</num>  percent of the population in punjab has access to proper solid waste management ,  which reflects a low a level of investment on sanitation and water supply . 
improvement in sanitation facilities is one of punjabs millennium development goals . 
the government has developed a plan to dispose of solid waste in a manner that both protects the population from its hazardous effects and also recycles it productively ,  karamat asserted . 
faisal gorchani of the sustainable development policy institute suggested that the government should also undertake a major pubic education effort to inspire behavioural changes that will reduce the extent of the problem .

iranian infighting leaves ahmadinejad isolated
tehran - irans president mahmoud ahmadinejad was left dangerously isolated as factional infighting further divided the countrys regime on july <num>27</num>  .
he came under attack from the inner circle of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei which supported him after he won irans disputed june <num>12</num>  presidential election . 
meanwhile ,  another presidential ally ,  industry minister ali akbar mehrabian ,  was found guilty of fraud . 
candidates defeated by ahmadinejad in the presidential election have not given up their campaign of defiance against the result . 
mir hossein mousavi ,  the most prominent challenger ,  called on his supporters to publicly commemorate the 40t day since demonstrators were killed by the security forces . 
the interior ministry said it had denied permission for a ceremony at a mosque in central tehran . 
political observers say ayatollah khameneis lieutenants were signalling a willingness to drop him ,  which could ease irans international isolation . 
ahmadinejad has attracted international approbation for his blustering declarations ,  as well as domestic criticism for his erratic approach to government . 
if they cant control him ,  they will get rid of him ,  but not now .

locomotive club athletic director rinat bilyaletdinov claimed his club would play against regar-tadaz with a seasoned group of lean and hungry young footballers . 
there was not one major locomotive player on the field . 
bilyaletdinov further unjustifiably claimed the match was a test of the teams strength prior to a game of the second tour of the russian championship . 
for the tajik club ,  the game with the russians became the control match prior to the finals of the asian football confederation presidential cup that dushanbe will host in september . 
currently there are several players of tajik origin who are being trained by locomotive . 
bilyaletdinov named muhammadnaimi sharifi ,  who played against the tajik club with the moscow team ,  and manuchekher jalilov ,  who is captain of the locomotive youth team and the best striker . 
not too long ago ,  locomotive's head coach was rashid rakhimov ,  pupil of the tajik football school . 
today ,  however ,  the level of tajik football barely exceeds that of neighbourhood games . 
training of professional athletes in the country falls short of adequate . 
kyrgyzstan provides no protection to domestic abuse victims
victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly female .

kyrgyzstan - last year ,  kyrgyz police received more than <num>10,000</num>  complaints from victims of domestic violence ,  according to a study conducted by several womens advocacy groups financed by the danish institute for human rights . 
the overwhelming majority of victims were women . 
but according to human rights expert anara niyazova ,  criminal charges were filed in only one case over the last six years . 
much of kyrgyzstans rural population still denies women their fundamental human rights . 
 ( photo by zaytuna abdullo ) 
more than <num>40</num>  percent of murders committed in kyrgyzstan are the result of domestic disputes . 
according to niyazova ,  nearly <num>90</num>  percent of women who kill their spouse or common-law partner do so out of despair after years of systematic abuse . 
this phenomenon arises because authorities have proven unwilling to defend basic human rights ,  particularly with victims of domestic violence ,  she claimed .

the unidentified defendants have not had access to legal defence and the court in which they are being tried has yet to be announced . 
the irna state news agency ,  however ,  says they have been charged with threatening national security ,  maintaining links to terrorist groups and sabotage . 
observers say that the penalties could range from brief imprisonment to death . 
these are going to be <abbr>…</abbr>  show trials ,  one analyst in tehran said . 
irna purported to explain how opposition demonstrations were organised . 
it claimed there was a control room that identified targets ,  guided thugs and divided activists into groups of stone throwers ,  weapon bearers and slogan chanters . 
it asserted that the opposition set up safe houses and used bbc persian and the voice of america to broadcast its messages . 
it even claimed that womens hairdressing salons had been used as storage and distribution depots for guns ,  knives and acid ,  and that the opposition had poured oil on the roads ,  so that motorcycle-riding security forces would slip when chasing demonstrators . 
irna linked some of the defendants to mujahedeen-e khalq ,  a militant group of iranian exiles ,  and others to the bahai faith ,  a regular target of the regime . 
other specific charges against the defendants included planting bombs ,  carrying weapons and grenades ,  attacking police and basij militiamen ,  destroying public property and sending images to enemy media .

astana - since the beginning of the year ,  kazakh special services have seized more than two tonnes of drugs and smashed <num>25</num>  drug rings and <num>50</num>  drug trafficking routes . 
operation safari transit was the biggest counternarcotics operation carried out this year . 
it led to the capture of members of a nigerian drug mafia that transported heroin from afghanistan to china via kazakhstan . 
ghanaians ,  uzbeks ,  indians and kazakhs worked as drug mules for the gang . 
he did not reveal all the details ,  but said that it took several months to complete . 
an nsc officer had to infiltrate the criminal network ,  whose mules transported drugs inside their stomachs . 
the drug dealers were arrested in guangzhou ,  china . 
the undercover nsc officer gave them drugs ,  and all our chinese partners had to do was handcuff the dealers ,  didenko said . 
so far this year ,  the nsc has carried out <num>11</num>  joint operations with the special services of china ,  russia and other central asian countries . 
during operations pyramid and temir tor ,  which led to the closure of drug supply routes out of kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan ,  more than <num>20</num>  leaders and active members of criminal gangs were arrested . 
weapons ,  foreign currency and jewellery were also seized along with narcotics . 
the un estimates that on average ,  <num>15</num>  percent of all drugs produced in afghanistan pass through central asian countries that are unable to stop the flow unaided . 
experts say the region needs financial and technical assistance . 
its borders need modern drug detection equipment and the launch of public anti-drug campaigns to contribute to reducing the flow of narcotics across their territories .

according to director mukhabbat juraeva ,  about <num>1,300</num>  young patients have come here for treatment over the past four years . 
the centres specialists hope that the support of foreign organisations will allow them to begin treating children who suffer from cerebral palsy as well . 
sogdi region currently doesnt have a single rehabilitation centre for children with cerebral palsy ,  a disease that children are diagnosed with fairly frequently ,  juraeva said . 
the centre is unable to offer help to all the children who need it . 
in sogdi region alone ,  there are currently more than <num>13,500</num>  children with disabilities ,  nearly half of whom are school-aged . 
education expert makhina usmonova said that only <num>411</num>  of those children are being educated in specialised schools . 
often these children live in rural areas where there are no specialised childrens centres ,  and their parents are unable to send them to regional centres for treatment and education ,  usmonova said . 
unfortunately ,  disabled children and their parents encounter other problems as well . 
for example ,  the region does not have remedial schools for children with delayed psychological development . 
in addition ,  it does not have a single education institution that trains remedial specialists . 
the only department that did so was part of the state pedagogical university and was closed in <num>2006</num>  because it wasnt profitable .

tajik journalists claim that media play a special role in vital aspects of the nations society and are pleading for the government to take note of it to avoid shutdowns of mass media oulets ,  which they claim would cause an information vacuum in the country and negatively affect tajikistan's information security and image abroad . 
the tajik media community is asking the country's financial organisations to open no-interest credit lines for media firms or provision government grants . 
in addition ,  they seek a five-year moratorium on payment of profit and value-added taxes and call for the government to reform the postal service to ensure timely distribution of printed material in the country . 
the media community is also proposing that the licencing law be abolished for audio-visual product manufacture .

tajik schools to teach islam
the new course will be taught by secular teachers . 
 ( photo by reuters / eduardo munoz ) 
bibikhabo sharofova ,  head of pre-school and secondary school education at the ministry of education ,  announced that the new course will be taught by academic literature and history teachers . 
the ministry hopes to encourage the secular rather than fundamentalist study of islam . 
<num>2009</num>  was declared the year of imomi azam in tajikistan after the founder of the hanafi school of sunni islam ,  practised by most muslims in the country . 
announcing the designation ,  education minister abdudzhabbor rakhmonov called the decision very symbolic . 
sharofova said that the new curriculum has already been determined and a textbook has been selected for use in the third and fourth grades . 
the new course will initially be taught only in the third grade for <num>34</num>  hours during the school year on an experimental basis . 
the textbook includes information on the history of islam ,  the koran and the prophet mohammed . 
it also covers the structure of the koran ,  the sura ,  and the ayat ,  and offers a commentary on the koran and the hadith . 
not everyone in tajikistan agrees with the ministry of education that secular teachers should teach the new course . 
political analyst parviz mullodzhanov believes that only subject matter experts should teach islam . 
teachers who are graduates of imomi azam islamic university ,  an institution recognised by the state ,  and receive a deep knowledge of hanafi islam ,  should be sent to the schools . 
he also doubts that the ministry will be able to train in just two weeks history teachers who have not formally studied islam . 
furthermore ,  he believes that the classes will not be attended by religious communities ,  and that ordinary muslims will continue to send their children to unofficial islamic schools . 
small loans provide big gains for afghans
 ( photo by chris hondros / getty images ) 
the establishment of microfinance in post-conflict afghanistan is touted by many as a shining star for being one of the worlds most transparent financial sectors . 
stephen rasmussen ,  a lead specialist at the world bank ,  has been involved in the sectors development in afghanistan for the past four years . 
but some of us saw a huge opportunity to shape microfinance the right way by building on the back of more than <num>30</num>  years of microfinance history . 
in order to provide more loans to individuals like aisha ,  the microfinance investment support facility for afghanistan  ( misfa )  was created under an agreement between the world-bank-administered afghanistan reconstruction trust fund  ( artf )  and the ministry of finance . 
supported by multi-donors ,  artf was established in <num>2002</num>  to support the recurrent costs of the afghan government ,  such as salaries for teachers ,  health workers ,  ministry staff ,  operations and other expenditures . 
through funding from artf ,  misfa began as a pilot project run within the ministry of rural rehabilitation and development . 
in addition to having a strict approval process ,  continuous funding from misfa is contingent on good performance and practitioners say that this top-down approach is the reason for the sectors high rate of success in afghanistan . 
zia jan ,  aged <num>40</num>  , is a tajik woman who has taken numerous loans from the afghan-run mfi parwaz . 
it was hard work and made me physically ill but it was the only option i had to make a living . 
my husband works as a painter and there was no building happening during those days so he rarely found work ,  she says . 
she has taken a series of loans totalling <num>800</num>  $  to run a livestock and carpet weaving business . 
in my community there are <num>3</num>  or <num>4</num>  families sharing one home . 
these loans have helped us earn decent livings where we can help our husbands provide for our households .

the government said that the council was converted to coordinate the activity of state agencies and local governments in preventing religious conflicts ,  as well as the spread of religious extremism and fundamentalism . 
due to the importance of this issue ,  decisions made by the coordinating council will be mandatory across all government agencies ,  from ministries to local governments . 
the government currently relies mainly on law enforcement and security agencies to combat religious extremism . 
the day the resolution was passed ,  five members of the underground hizb ut-tahrir party were arrested in southern kyrgyzstan . 
local police said that they had been promoting radical islam in the kara-sui district and osh region for some time ,  and were on their list of suspected religious extremists . 
the state also relies on the muslim spiritual governance institute in kyrgyzstan ,  which has an extremely limited sphere of influence ,  and is not well regarded by religious followers . 
in april ,  the muslim spiritual governance agency banned priests from interfering in politics in an attempt to change the situation . 
various estimates put the number of supporters of fundamentalist organizations at between <num>10,000</num>  and <num>15,000</num>  people . 
in june ,  several skirmishes in southern kyrgyzstan led to the arrest of fundamentalist supporters and left nine armed extremists dead .

the netherlands red cross contributed to making the project possible according to institute director kanat abdrakhmanov . 
 " unfortunately ,  most people here build their homes with no consideration for the risk of earthquakes . 
 "  his experience has shown that residents are largely unaware of the construction codes for seismically active areas and have no idea what to do if an earthquake occurs . 
even kyrgyzstan's seismological research facilities are in buildings prone to collapse during an earthquake .

petrol price talks between uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan postponed
uzbekistan supplies between <num>700</num>  and <num>800</num>  million cubic metres of petrol a year to kyrgyzstan . 
kyrgyzstan had asked uzbekistan to lower the price it is paying in light of the global drop in fuel prices in the first half of the year ,  but uzbekistan is not willing to talk until kyrgyzstan pays off the us$18 million it owes for prior supplies . 
in recently years ,  uzbekistan had supplied between <num>700</num>  and <num>800</num>  mcm of gas a year to kyrgyzstan ,  but apparently will supply much less this year . 
the kyrgyz government already warned the public in the spring that rotating blackouts would resume in the autumn and winter .

tajikistan intends to replenishes gold reserves
dushanbe - tajikistan's ministry of finance intends to increase gold production at the shugnob gold mine to <num>400</num>  kilogram  per year . 
according to tajikistan finance minister safarali nadjimiddinov ,  gold production will increase in conjunction with a three-year programme of technological modernisation of mining facilities . 
nadjimiddinov emphasised that as recently as <num>2000</num>  , the ministry of finance did not have one kilogram of gold . 
the finance minister said that all gold produced now is being stored in reserve to cover potential supply disruptions in the future . 
deputy minister of energy and industry makmadsharif hakdodov stated that in the first six months of this year ,  <num>600</num>  kilogram  of gold were mined in the country ,  <num>100</num>  kilogram  less than the amount mined in the same period last year . 
the reason for this decrease is work currently in progress to modernise the zarafshon joint venture gold mine . 
according to sharif rakhimzod ,  tajikistan national bank chairman ,  the bank obtained <num>217</num>  kilogram  of gold in the first six months of this year ,  or <num>50</num>  kilogram  less than for the same period in <num>2008</num>  .
political parties claim winter conditions will threaten election in tajikistan
a harsh winter and a stiff electoral deposit of us$1 , 250 may prevent candidates from competing in the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
 ( photo by maxim marmur / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - political parties in the autonomous province of gorno-badakhshan fear that winter conditions could pose problems for the parliamentary election campaign taking place in the middle of winter next february . 
badakhshan ,  the most mountainous region of tajikistan ,  has an extremely harsh climate . 
temperatures can drop to minus <num>30</num>  degree celsious  ,  and avalanches and landslides can prevent vehicles from negotiating the treacherous mountain roads . 
head of the provincial branch of the social democratic party of tajikistan  ( sdpt )  alim sherzamonov says these circumstances could limit his partys ability to campaign . 
in previous elections ,  avalanches and other natural hazards prevented us from getting out to the majority of voters ,  he noted . 
his fears are shared by representatives of the islamic rebirth party  ( irp )  and the communist party of tajikistan  ( cpt )  . 
given the current situation ,  we feel it is unacceptable for the elections to be held during the winter ,  they say . 
representatives of the ruling national democratic party of tajikistan  ( ndpt )  that holds <num>51</num>  out of <num>63</num>  seats in the lower chamber and <num>29</num>  out of <num>34</num>  seats in the upper chamber of parliament are more optimistic . 
there is no reason to fear winter in gorno-badakhshan ;  political parties must courageously enter the political contest ,  the ndpt has advised its opponents . 
the consequences of the global financial crisis may also affect politics in tajikistan . 
analysts fear the requirement that registered candidates pay a deposit of us$1 , 250 to run for election may mean some parties will not be able to participate in the contest . 
in addition ,  losing candidates forfeit their deposits to the state treasury . 
cotton processing in decline
tajikistan - tajikistans manufacturing sector is contracting . 
according to figures from the state statistics committee ,  the countrys manufacturing output for the first seven months of this year was approximately us$690 million ,  almost <num>15</num>  percent less than for the same period in <num>2008</num>  .
cotton-processing was the hardest hit sector . 
during the first seven months of the year ,  cotton-processing companies manufactured <num>36</num>  $  million worth of products ,  a decrease of <num>16.5</num>  percent in comparison to the same period in <num>2008</num>  .
there are now just <num>14</num>  spinning-mills and five textile mills in tajikistan . 
mills that are still running frequently experience difficulties due to the lack of orders and are operating at just ten percent of their capacity . 
tajikistan produced a total of <num>11,000</num>  tonnes of cotton yarn in <num>2008</num>  , and in the first half of this year produced less than half that amount ,  just <num>4,700</num>  tonnes . 
as part of a government programme aimed at boosting light industry ,  eight new textile factories are scheduled to be built in tajikistan by <num>2015</num>  .
experts believe this will help ensure that all the cotton harvested in the nation can be processed domestically . 
two factories have already opened earlier this year and there are plans to open another three by the end of the year . 
one of the goals of the programme is to create large textile companies that can manufacture finished products .

kyrgyzstan - a kyrgyz human rights organisation has called for immediate reform of the special services ,  including the state national security committee ,  the successor to the soviet kgb internal security agency . 
kylym shamy said the objective of the protest was to draw public attention to the fact that serious violations of human rights are occurring  [ in kyrgyzstan ]  under the pretext of a campaign against religious extremists and terrorism ,  and that the civilian population is suffering as a result . 
we call on the president of kyrgyzstan…to take note of the serious breaches of human rights that are occurring as part of the campaign against terrorism and religious extremism . 
we call for reform of the special services ,  including the snsc ,  said the head of the kylym shamy centre ,  aziza abdurasulova . 
new rail line between uzbekistan ,  afghanistan to serve strategic purpose
the proposed rail line is <num>67</num>  kilometer  long . 
 ( photo by afp / getty images ) 
uzbekistan - the construction of a rail line connecting uzbekistan with mazar-e sharif ,  a major city in northern afghanistan ,  financed by the asian development bank ,  will begin in the coming months . 
the line will be an extension of the old branch that connects galaba and hairaton ,  two cities along the countries border . 
the construction of the <num>67</num>  kilometer -long line is included in a memorandum of understanding to expand trade and economic opportunities that was recently signed by uzbekistan ,  afghanistan and the asian development bank . 
other investors planned the construction of a hairaton-mazar-e sharif railway before now . 
at the end of last year ,  it was reported that the german military was planning to build a main line in fulfillment of its peacekeeping mission in northern afghanistan . 
as of now ,  afghanistan has only <num>24.6</num>  kilometer  of rails . 
the existing branches connect border communities in northern afghanistan with stations in uzbekistan and turkmenistan . 
the new railroad will allow the smooth delivery of cargo directly from termez to mazar-e sharif and will substantially lower expenditures for transport of equipment necessary for peacekeeping coalition forces in afghanistan . 
in addition ,  it is hoped that the railroad will stimulate trade between afghanistan and the former soviet republics of central asia ,  which declined when the taliban assumed power in kabul in <num>1996</num>  .
conflict in south ossetia casts long shadow in fergana valley
submitted by our user
why ,  a year after the start of the conflict between georgia and south ossetia ,  does the topic remain the subject of discussion in uzbekistan ? 
from the very beginning ,  this conflict has generated intense interest in uzbekistan's leadership . 
after all ,  the country has its own tinderbox region ,  the fergana valley ,  where it shares a poorly delineated and contested border with tajikistan and kyrgyzstan and where armed incidents are a frequent occurrence . 
caught in the crossfire is the civilian population ,  some of whom have been shot dead by border guards or killed by mines while trying to cross the border . 
in uzbekistan ,  no major decisions are made without a thorough review by two competing government agencies ,  the presidential staff and the national security service . 
on august <num>10</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , mere days after fighting broke out in south ossetia ,  a special study group was convened by the uzbek government and charged with analysing every aspect of the conflict . 
the group's conclusions were to take the form of a series of documentary films on the war ,  to be shown in closed screenings at several national security agencies . 
assessing the possibility of similar flare-ups in the fergana valley ,  some analysts have predicted near-term conflicts of the following nature : 
 *  religious :  in this scenario ,  radical extremists might set their followers loose on the christian minority ,  particularly the small set of christians who have converted from islam . 
 *  border skirmishes :  armed hostilities across national borders in the fergana valley are seen as quite likely ,  especially during a transition to a new president in any of these three central asian nations . 
the oldest among these men ,  islam karimov ,  while not exactly known for restraint ,  has consistently thrown cold water on the plans of his hot-headed generals to solve intractable water-usage problems through military force . 
bearing these regional tensions in mind ,  the uzbek study group quickly cobbled together material on the war in south ossetia for the classified documentary . 
the film analyses the methods and tactics of russian troops fighting in the mountains and in city streets ,  with particular emphasis on battlefield reconnaissance and the information war :  how to blanket foreign media and ensure the correct coverage in domestic news outlets . 
officials in uzbekistan's foreign ministry have been ordered to have ready-made diplomatic notes ,  press releases and statements on hand should war break out in the fergana . 
measures have been put into place to immediately block internet access and other means of communication such as radio and cell phones . 
in this strained atmosphere ,  russia's decision to open another base in kyrgyzstan ,  though billed as a  ' training centre ,  '  is an annoyance and source of anxiety for uzbekistan's leadership . 
in the event of a conflict between uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan ,  it is already clear who the russian troops will back . 
this is why uzbekistan's national security service is cultivating anti-russian sentiments in kyrgyzstan's south ,  hoping to create local resistance to the russian base . 
uzbek money has been flowing to kyrgyz government officials ,  religious leaders and members of kyrgyzstan's intelligence community . 
by the end of august and the beginning of september ,  anti-russian protests should take place in the osh and batken regions . 
that is ,  if russian agents don't disrupt the work of their uzbek counterparts . 
this is not the first time a central asian newspaper has been forced to cease publication by staggering losses in a court battle . 
 ( photo by yoray liberman / getty images ) 
kazakhstan - on august <num>25</num>  , oksana makushkina ,  deputy editor of the republic business review ,  said the newspaper was on the brink of closure and that its fate lay in the hands of the court . 
initial court hearings began on august <num>19</num>  after bta bank rebuffed offers to settle out of court . 
the papers owners do not have the funds to cover potential damages in a trial . 
the largest privately-held bank in kazakhstan and the cis ,  built from the ground up as an international business corporation ,  has adapted poorly to government takeover . 
since february ,  btas chief shareholder has been the government ,  which ,  according to its memorandum on bank stability ,  was required to intercede when btas operating capital proved insufficient to meet its financial obligations . 
this is not the first time a media outlet has been forced out of business in this way . 
on january <num>16</num>  , the medeus district court ruled that another opposition newspaper ,  taszhargan ,  owed <num>2</num>  $  million to parliamentary deputy romin madinov in psychological damages . 
pakistan adopts fuel emission standards
euro norms  ( en )  refer to emission levels from both petrol- and diesel-fueled vehicles legally permitted in europe . 
these norms require manufacturers to make technical changes to their vehicles to reduce emission levels and will also require changes in refining petroleum and diesel fuels . 
the decision to introduce euro-ii standards was made in order to control air pollution caused by vehicles ,  said asif . 
pakistan  [ will ]  implement these standards to introduce more environmentally friendly vehicles on pakistani roads . 
although the refineries are already working to produce euro ii-compliant petrol and diesel ,  asif estimates the long-term production costs to be us$700 million . 
according to the epa ,  the government is working with all segments concerned to adopt euro ii standards . 
the petroleum and environment ministries and auto manufacturers will play pivotal roles in meeting the projected deadlines . 
in another bid to reduce air pollution ,  the government promoted the use of natural gas  ( cng )  vehicles . 
more than two million vehicles in the country have already been converted to the fuel . 
taliban mutilate man for voting in afghan election
the man was one of millions of people who ignored taliban threats against voters and set out to cast his ballot . 
 " i saw one reaching my nose with a knife . 
i asked him to stop ,  but it was useless ,  "  mohammad said . 
the taliban vowed to disrupt the august <num>20</num>  vote ,  with rocket attacks and bombings across the country . 
while those they conducted failed to prevent the election from taking place ,  the violence affected turnout in some areas ,  especially the taliban heartland in the south . 
election officials reported a number of incidents in which militants cut off voters' fingers stained with indelible ink . 
a doctor said mohammad needed plastic surgery and weeks for his treatment and recovery . 
mohammad hopes the government will support his family until he recovers .

emergency health care reform launched in kyrgyzstan
despite a history of frequent natural disasters ,  kyrgyzstan does not have a nationwide emergency medical response system . 
 ( photo by ted aljibe / afp / getty images ) 
kyrygzstan - the kyrgyz government has launched a package of initiatives aimed at reforming the country's health care system . 
by the end of the year ,  officials hope to implement a new nationwide system of emergency care in the event of disaster . 
according to him ,  the programme will be built around recent advances in the science of disaster medicine and will improve the efficiency of emergency first-aid . 
many of the first-aid procedures currently in use in the country are obsolete and consequently less effective . 
earlier this year ,  the kyrgyz government allocated us$6 million to improve care at rural hospitals ,  a portion of which was funded by international grants . 
the young doctors investment programme is aimed at encouraging young medical specialists to stay in provincial hospitals . 
and if housing were to be provided in addition to the cash bonus ,  many more  [ doctors ]  would stay in these rural hospitals ,  "  says cardiologist askar raimberdiyev . 
a major component of the push to improve health care in provincial areas is upgrading medical equipment . 
rural clinics have already received the equivalent of us$3 million in necessary equipment and instruments . 
with last year's energy crisis in mind ,  hospitals have been pushing for electrical generators and hot-water heaters for their maternity wards and urgent care facilities .

beijing prepares for the <num>2008</num>  olympic games
stirring the latest concerns were videotaped threats purporting to be from an islamic militant group . 
they surfaced last week in the name of the turkistan islamic party - a group chinese and western terrorism experts say is an offshoot of a secessionist group from china's central asian frontier with ties to al-qaeda . 
 " our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics . 
we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed ,  "  he said . 
chinese police immediately played down the threat ,  saying the explosions in chinese cities claimed by the group were not the work of terrorists . 
still beijing is being emptied of political critics ,  underground christian organisers and ordinary chinese who come to the capital to protest local government injustices . 
 " they didn't beat me ,  but there are different kinds of intimidation .  " 
 " through all kinds of efforts and by relying on the support and cooperation from the international society and the general public ,  we are confident we can deal with all the threats and risks and challenges ,  "  liu shaowu ,  director of security for the beijing olympics organising committee ,  told the associated press july <num>20</num>  .
president hu jintao told fellow communist leaders over the weekend that  " the task of hosting a safe olympic games is as heavy as mount tai and everyone shares the responsibility .  " 
 " the chances of attacks on olympic areas are very unlikely ,  "  said rohan gunaratna of the international centre for political violence and terrorism research in singapore . 
 " although the turkistan islamic party claimed that they were responsible ,  i personally think that it's all bluff and bluster ,  "  said li ,  the counterterrorism expert .

 ( photo by joerg koch / afp / getty images ) 
tashkent - man ,  a leading german lorry manufacturing firm ,  has gained a foothold in the heavy lorry market in central asia with an initial investment of us$1 . 2 million in a joint venture with uzbekistan . 
on september <num>4</num>  , a man-cla tractor rolled off the assembly line at the samarkand auto plant . 
it was the first of <num>200</num>  cla and tga lorries to be assembled there by the end of the year . 
the man avto-uzbekistan joint venture will share the samarkand auto plant facilities which are also used in another joint venture with japans isuzu . 
the japanese company initially contracted to produce medium-sized city buses and various types of lorry ,  from small to heavy dump vehicles ,  but later dropped plans to assemble heavy lorries . 
isuzu said it would be unprofitable to transport semi-assembled parts for dump lorries across the continent for final assembly in samarkand . 
uzavtosanoat deputy chairman gairat niyazaov said that central asian countries import <num>21,000</num>  heavy lorries every year . 
given that samarkand has excellent production facilities and trained personnel ,  we decided to set up production here ,  he added . 
the plant will be able to assemble <num>2,000</num>  lorries a year . 
as the business expands ,  it will make the transition from assembly to full-scale production . 
the tashkent tractor plant has already begun producing trailers for man tractors . 
the samarkand plant is our first in the cis and will represent our brand in this market . 
our dealers in russia ,  ukraine ,  kazakhstan ,  azerbaijan ,  and turkmenistan will offer man trucks assembled in uzbekistan as well ,  nielsson said . 
tajikistan seeks compensation for presence of russian military base
tajikistan - tajik authorities intend to review the countrys military cooperation with russia and seek compensation for a russian military base on its territory amounting to us$300 million a year . 
the continued presence of the russian military in tajikistan was discussed on september <num>11</num>  during a visit by russian defense minister anatoliy serdyukov to dushanbe . 
he met behind closed doors with his tajik counterpart sherali khairulloyev ,  and foreign affairs minister khamrokhon zarifi . 
while details of their meeting have not been made public ,  it appears that no agreement was reached . 
russias military base in tajikistan was established in <num>2005</num>  following the initial posting of its 201st motorised rifle division in <num>1993</num>  in accordance with a bilateral friendship agreement in effect at the time . 
reports that tajikistan intends to review the russian military presence ,  particularly its base on tajik territory ,  first surfaced in july ,  shortly before russian president dmitry medvedev visited dushanbe . 
medvedev stated ,  however ,  that the matter was not discussed then . 
experts assume that tajikistans effort to benefit financially from the presence of the russian base is linked to the countrys difficult economic situation . 
political analyst abdugani mamadazimov believes the financial crisis and failure of the russian government to adhere to a variety of bilateral commitments have compelled tajikistan to review many of its agreements with the russian federation . 
one of russias unfulfilled obligations ,  he said ,  is the operation of a company set up by tajikistan and russia in <num>1992</num>  to complete the rogun hydroelectric power plant . 
the expert said that russia had wasted tajikistans time for <num>17</num>  years when it became apparent in january ,  after medvedevs visit to tashkent ,  that moscow did not intend to participate in the project . 
the amount requested for the base is fair . 
we are entitled to demand compensation for <num>17</num>  years of waiting for rogun ,  mamadazimov believes . 
he also asserted that after the loss of the baltic region and the caucasus ,  russia intends to retain its presence in central asia at all costs ,  and if dushanbe insists ,  moscow will have no option other than to make concessions . 
al-qaeda-linked uzbek militant killed in pakistan
handcuffed uzbek are paraded past the media following their arrest by security forces at darra adam khel in pakistans north west frontier province . 
 " he was among three top militant commanders from central asia who had an affiliation with al-qaeda and had been working in and from our territory ,  "  said one senior pakistani intelligence official . 
a second official said jalolov was among four militants killed in the strike . 
hundreds of islamist militants from uzbekistan and elsewhere in central asia are believed to be based in militant enclaves in northwestern pakistan's ethnic pastun tribal lands ,  which no government has ever fully controlled . 
some have been there since the <num>1980</num>  second  ,  when militants flocked to the border from around the world to cross into afghanistan and fight soviet forces there . 
others fled across the border into pakistan when nato toppled a taliban government there in <num>2001</num>  .
hundreds of al-qaeda-linked militants have been killed or captured in pakistan since the <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
<num>11</num>  , <num>2001</num>  , attacks on the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud was killed in a missile strike in neighbouring south waziristan on <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>5</num>  .

the bank accounts of the papers owner and publisher were also frozen in accordance with a court decision on september <num>9</num>  on bta banks lawsuit against the paper . 
the decision ordering the newspaper to pay the bank a ruinous sum for damaging its business reputation is not yet in force because the paper has until september <num>24</num>  to appeal . 
court officers have already stopped all activity at the opposition papers offices ,  however . 
on september <num>9</num>  , the medeu court ordered that the newspaper pay the bank us$400 , 000 in moral damages for an article the paper had printed in march ,  between two evils ,  tis not worth choosing ,  and publish a retraction within ten calendar days . 
according to the plaintiff ,  the article led to the loss of <num>40</num>  $  million in bta deposits . 
this also proves that bta has no interest in money or a retraction ,  which cannot be published by a paper that has been closed down ,  said republic attorney sergei utkin .

 ( reuters / amit dave ) 
islamabad - pakistan imports the lions share of edible oil from malaysia ,  around <num>1.3</num>  million tonnes ,  in the form of palm oil ,  to meet domestic demand ,  said nasir ibrahim ,  a senior member of the pakistan vanaspati  ( edible oil )  manufacturers association  ( pvma )  on september <num>8</num>  .
edible oil imports cost more than us$1 billion annually ,  ibrahim said . 
despite being a predominantly agricultural country ,  pakistan does not encourage sufficient seed cultivation to meet its edible oil needs . 
most arable land is sown with other crops .

authorities accused kadyrov of organising mass riots on july <num>23</num>  , the day of the presidential election . 
following violent reprisals by authorities ,  however ,  the opposition curtailed their activities . 
these activities allegedly included a plan to seize a polling station in the town of balykchy to disrupt the elections ,  resulting in the arrest of <num>19</num>  opposition activists . 
the public prosecutors office claimed that kadyrov was the main instigator of the event . 
the leader of the sda faction in parliament ,  baktybek beshimov ,  reportedly left the country some time earlier to escape direct death threats . 
i was forced to secretly cross the kyrgyz-kazakh border ,  he said .

one of the escapees was arrested the following day . 
authorities have not yet revealed his identity or details about his capture . 
according to initial reports ,  however ,  two officers at the remand centre in the osh province were involved in the escape . 
a plan to recapture the other escapees has been implemented in the three southern provinces of kyrgyzstan . 
the border agency and departments of the ministry of internal affairs and snsc have been alerted . 
kyrgyz security officers have also sought assistance from their uzbek counterparts . 
over the past two years ,  kyrgyz security authorities have cracked down on the activity of extremist religious organisations . 
the ministry of internal affairs press office stated that a local hizb ut-tahrir leader was seized in osh on september <num>16</num>  , along with extremist literature and a <num>20</num>  milimeter  sawn-off shotgun ,  which had had its identification numbers erased . 
two members of hizb ut-tahrir who had funded local cells were arrested in bishkek in july . 
some observers contend that tough government measures against religious parties and movements actually serve to increase their popularity . 
in addition ,  those convicted of involvement with extremist religious organisations use their time in prison to attempt to enlist new recruits . 
on another note ,  an increasing number of women are now joining organisations such as hizb ut-tahrir ,  according to a report by the international crisis group ,  an internationally recognised ngo . 
the new centre at karakorum international university aims to save the shina language from extinction . 
shina ,  a dardic language ,  is spoken by approximately <num>60</num>  percent of the inhabitants of the gilgit-baltistan region in northern pakistan and in parts of indian-administered kashmir . 
shina currently has no recognised alphabet in published form ,  and project members are working to create one . 
shina is under the constant threat of extinction and replacement by major languages such as urdu . 
any delay in creating an alphabet for this language will threaten its existence even further ,  said abdul basit ,  a linguistics student at kiu . 
earlier this month ,  kiu conducted a workshop to initiate efforts to preserve and promote the shina language and therefore raise awareness of the language . 
the workshop entitled the linguistic and socio-linguistic base of orthography development was held in collaboration with the international language and culture promotion society ,  a local non-governmental organisation .

the wdfp federation was created in <num>1988</num>  as an alternative to the international federation . 
it was aimed at providing an arena for drug-free athletes by implementing strict controls on doping . 
the competition includes only three events :  the squat ,  bench press and dead lift .

russian employers owe tajik workers more than us$1 million
russia's restrictions on migrant labour continue to exact a toll on tajik workers . 
 ( photo by evaristo sa / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - months ,  and in some cases years later ,  many tajik migrant workers have still not received back-pay from their russian employers . 
director abdurakhim rakhimov of the tajikistan ministry of internal affairs office for migrant workers in russia said tajik migrant workers have flooded his office with more than <num>400</num>  complaints ,  a quarter of which concern pay arrears . 
 " currently ,  more than us$1 million is owed to tajik workers in unpaid salaries ,  "  he said . 
data released by russia's federal migration service indicate there are around <num>300,000</num>  tajik migrants working in russia ,  almost half of whom are employed in construction . 
analysts contend ,  however ,  that the true number of tajik workers in russia is close to one million .

there has been no official confirmation of this information from authorities in pakistan ,  afghanistan or the international security assistance force command in afghanistan . 
this is not the first report of the death of yuldashev ,  who headed the imu since it was founded in <num>1996</num>  .
however ,  no video statement has been released subsequently either ,  which would have proved that he was still alive . 
after successful operations by nato forces in afghanistan ,  the uzbek militants ,  along with the taliban fighters ,  fled to the pakistani tribal zone in <num>2001</num>  .
takhir yuldash  ( yuldashev )  was fifth on a list of the twelve most wanted militants in afghanistan .

throughout the world ,  light radiates from the heavens on earth ,  and only in holy bukhara the light emanates from the earth to the heavens ,  according to a saying from the hadith ,  which contains oral traditions relating to the words and deeds of the prophet muhammad . 
bukhara has always been the centre of islamic treasures and of islam . 
the interior of the ancient mosque will be restored . 
 ( photo by <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  embassy tashkent ) 
the mosque has fallen into derelict condition . 
insects are destroying the unique carved wood columns ,  and the internal and external furnishings of the mosque . 
the lack of proper ventilation and lighting makes it impossible to view the treasures this cultural monument offers ,  director of the bukhara architectural museum robert almeyev said . 
the treasures include about <num>60</num>  priceless manuscripts from the ninth to 19t centuries ,  and artefacts that were never insured due to a lack of resources . 
the funding to protect cultural valuables was enacted by the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  congress in <num>2001</num>  , and since then the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ambasssador to tashkent has provided <num>165,000</num>  $  to protect historical sites in uzbekistan . 
the grants generated microfilms of ancient manuscripts from the tashkent eastern studies institute ,  and made possible the preservation of <num>20</num>  copies of the koran at the samarkand museum of history . 
they also created a potters shop in tashkent ,  and made possible excavations at the kampir-tepe fortress near samarkand in the vanished 12t century city of afrosiab . 
tough times for russian language in turkmenistan
during the week ,  turkmenistans museum of fine arts exhibited the works of turkmen artists who had studied in russia ,  screened the documentary ,  turkmenistan and russia :  cooperation in the new renaissance and was the venue for a concert of classical and folk music sung in both turkmen and russian . 
another exhibition showcased russian book publishers ,  with more than seven hundred selected titles later presented as a gift to turkmenistan's national library . 
in addition ,  several roundtable discussions focused on the issues surrounding russian language instruction and its everyday use in turkmenistan . 
russian language week marked a distinct contrast to several trends that have limited the use of russian in turkmenistan since gaining independence from the soviet union . 
a number of importers bring in russian books ,  but their prices have made them largely inaccessible to many readers in turkmenistan . 
the state theatre ,  always a venue for russian-language dramatic works in the past ,  now stages productions in turkmen ,  and local newspapers and magazines published in russian were closed down long ago . 
a similar fate met many russian-language schools throughout the country . 
russian language instruction in turkmen schools is limited to one hour per week . 
the policy to restrict the language has been successful ,  and it is rare nowadays to find a russian speaker in most rural areas . 
many high school students and recent graduates ,  however ,  have shown strong interest in studying russian because of the difficulty of enrolling in local universities . 
many seek out private language tutors to help with applications to universities outside turkmenistan that conduct courses in russian .

 ( reuters / athar hussain ) 
karachi - leading clerics in pakistan have welcomed the north-west frontier province  ( nwfp )  assemblys decision to consider a bill requiring tests for hepatitis and thalassemia prior to issuing marriage licenses . 
it is not binding under islam to take tests for the detection of diseases before marriage ,  but requiring the tests is a good move to fight deadly diseases in pakistan that are claiming thousands of lives every year ,  said mufti muhammad naeem ,  head of jamia banoria in karachi . 
the government wants to protect people from two deadly diseases that not only claim lives ,  but also cause financial hardship . 
the detection of hepatitis and thalassemia will help overcome fatal diseases in the nwfp province ,  said mufti munib-ur-rehman ,  head of the ruet-e-hilal committee . 
the legislative assemblies of pakistans other provinces are to be informed about other measures they can take to protect people from major diseases .

kyrgyzstan ,  uzbekistan and turkmenistan have completely abolished the death penalty . 
kazakhstan only imposes it for certain types of crimes and tajikistan has introduced a moratorium on capital punishment ,  the document stated . 
the ec added that it hopes this policy will be extended ,  with a view to the complete abolition of the death penalty in all five former soviet republics in central asia . 
to date ,  <num>94</num>  governments around the world ,  including the member states of the e . u .  ,  have abolished the death penalty . 
another <num>45</num>  countries enforce the death penalty only in exceptional cases . 
capital punishment is still used in <num>58</num>  other countries ,  however . 
in <num>2008</num>  , <num>2,390</num>  prisoners were executed ,  while <num>8,864</num>  were sentenced to death . 
tajikistan has no plans to repeal the moratorium on the death penalty introduced in <num>2004</num>  , the president of the supreme court of tajikistan ,  nusratullo abdulloyev ,  announced on <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
i think one of the biggest achievements in the field of human and civil rights and freedoms since tajikistan gained independence is the abolition of the death penalty at the legislative level ,  abdulloyev said . 
tajikistan has replaced capital punishment with another harsh form of punishment ,  life imprisonment . 
nine life sentences have been handed down in this country so far this year ,  he stated .

sabri recounted that when she asked them where she was being taken ,  why they had arrested her and who they were ,  they responded by repeatedly slapping her face . 
sabri said the last time she was raped ,  her assailant took off her blindfold and said he would release her on the condition that ,  once released ,  she remain in contact and cooperate with him . 
she fled iran several weeks later and has applied for refugee status in turkey . 
sabri claims her father was arrested after she first went public with her testimony on voice of america . 
the iranian authorities appear more intent on learning the identities of those who claim to have been tortured by security officials than in carrying out an impartial investigation ,  "  said amnesty international secretary general irene khan .

we were informed that some security agents in pakistan are co-operating with the main elements of this terrorist incident ,  president ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by the semi-official iranian fars news agency . 
we regard it as our right to demand these criminals from them ,  he said . 
we ask the pakistani government not to delay the apprehension of the main elements in this terrorist attack . 
according to the bbc ,  pakistani foreign ministry spokesman abdul basit dismissed ahmedinajads claims that jundullahs leaders were in pakistan . 
iran previously accused the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and <abbr>u.k.</abbr>  of contributing to the attack . 
in his first comments on the bombing ,  iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khameini also blamed the united states . 
local media cited officials as saying that jundallah ,  also known as the popular resistance movement of iran ,  had accepted responsibility for sunday's bombing ,  although there were no direct claims from the group . 
jundallah has previously been accused by iran of terrorist activities in the province . 
the organisation says it is fighting against political and religious oppression of the sunni muslim minority in the shia-ruled country .

imu leader in tajikistan sentenced to life in prison
during the tajik civil war from <num>1992</num>  to1997 ,  the imu was part of the unified tajik opposition . 
 ( photo by shah marai / afp / getty images ) 
investigators established that the convicted men took part in attacks on a jail in kairakkuma and on border stations between tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in <num>2006</num>  .
nine policemen and border troops were killed in the attacks . 
according to the tajik prosecutor general ,  kayumov headed the imu cell since <num>1997</num>  .
he received military training from the former imu leader jumaboi khojiev  ( also known as juma namangoni )  ,  who died in <num>2001</num>  in afghanistan . 
it was namangoni who sent kayumov to northern tajikistan to recruit new members for the imu . 
the extremist was detained in kabul in <num>2008</num>  at the request of tajik law enforcement and extradited to tajikistan . 
the other convicts were detained in <num>2008</num>  in tajikistan . 
during the tajik civil war between <num>1992</num>  and <num>1997</num>  , the imu was part of the unified tajik opposition  ( uto )  . 
after peace was achieved ,  however ,  the opposition's armed forces joined with the government and forced the imu from tajik territory . 
some former tajik opposition members ,  however ,  continued to maintain contact with imu members who remained on tajik territory for many years . 
last summer ,  former uto field commander mirzo ziyoev ,  believed by tajik law enforcement to be a patron of the imu ,  was killed during a special operation to eliminate the movement . 
according to tajik experts ,  imu extremists use tajikistan as a centre for the transit of drugs ,  which they use to finance their organisation and support military training for their members . 
government shake-up in kyrgyzstan

sensational aspects of the shake-up include the dismissal of the government ,  a reduction in the number of ministries and a <num>40</num>  percent cut in the number of employees in the presidential administration . 
experts claim that president bakiyevs far-reaching government reforms focus on the economy in particular .

members of the opposition feel certain ,  however ,  that the head of state is merely tightening his grip on power . 
security analyst says pakistan requires internal discourse to develop alternatives to extremism
lahore - pakistan needs an internal discourse ,  without which it cannot counter extremism or terrorism at the state and societal level ,  according to leading independent security analyst and strategic affairs expert dr ayesha siddiqa agha . 
the south asian region currently faces grave security threats due to increasing extremism and terrorist activities within its states . 
the politics of violence can be linked to the contradictions arising out of flawed national policies ,  she said . 
religious extremism is a global issue ,  but in south asia ,  pakistan is the nation worst affected by it . 
extremism and terrorism are interlinked and the contributing factors of bad governance and ideology make extremism more threatening in pakistan . 
a counter-terrorism strategy cannot be developed without considering counter-extremism at the same time ,  agha said . 
she called for internal discourse within the muslim world to provide alternatives to extremism and suggested that one would require an overhaul of government policies to generate political stability . 
the factors that have generated social ,  economic and political instability in pakistan suggest that there are no quick fixes available and that turning things around will only be achieved by measures implemented over the long term ,  she said . 
that would go a long way to reducing their potential for recruiting young people into violent extremist organisations . 
she also pointed out a dire need to create an even more specialised anti-terrorism force and suggested that the army's special services group  ( ssg )  be converted into a force solely dedicated to counter-terrorism .

critics who have praised the film say that kelin is unlike any of the other films nominated for an oscar in the same category . 
oleg boretsky ,  the countrys leading film critic said ,  it is a highly original film and its story is told in the purest form of film language . 
it has already won the top prize at a russian film festival in yalta . 
not a word is spoken in the film . 
the story that kelin tells is a simple one . 
a father offers his daughters hand in marriage to a suitor bearing more valuable gifts than those offered by the man she loves . 
the young woman goes to live with her new husbands family under the same roof as his mother and younger brother . 
most of the ten to <num>15</num>  feature films made in kazakhstan every year are the products of the state film company kazakhfilm .

afghan refugees awarded funding for study in tajikistan
to date ,  <num>22</num>  afghan students have received scholarships to study in tajikistan through the dafi programme . 
 ( photo by natalie behring / getty images ) 
dafi is financed by the german ministry of foreign affairs and has operated since <num>1992</num>  in countries that accept refugees ,  including tajikistan . 
the dafi programme is run by the ngo refugee children and vulnerable citizens ,  a partner of the office of the un high commissioner for refugees  ( unhcr )  in tajikistan . 
the project began in tajikistan last year ,  when seven refugee students received scholarships to study at universities . 
this year there were <num>50</num>  applications . 
in selecting candidates ,  we focus on the following disciplines :  computer-related technologies ,  teaching ,  medicine ,  construction and economics ,  says ilya todorovich ,  the head of the unhcr office in tajikistan . 
todorovich said that more than <num>4,000</num>  afghans have recently been granted asylum in tajikistan . 
while there has been an influx of refugees from afghanistan over the past few years ,  the number this year has risen dramatically with the arrival of <num>2,200</num>  new refugees . 
until the security situation in afghanistan improves ,  the influx of refugees is unlikely to abate ,  todorovich added .

pakistan's uzbek militants
the pakistani army is bracing itself for confrontation in south waziristan with what it says is a large group of uzbek extremists . 
most of the uzbek militants in south waziristan belong to the al qaeda-linked group ,  the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  . 
renowned for their fanaticism ,  uzbek militants initially fled their home country in the early <num>1990</num>  second  after a government crackdown on people who advocated the introduction of sharia law in secular uzbekistan . 
nobody knows exactly how many there are in pakistan . 
estimates vary wildly from <num>500</num>  to <num>5,000</num>  .
not all uzbeks there are active militants . 
some are merely supporters of the taliban while others are little more than mercenaries . 
when founded in august <num>1998</num>  in the north of afghanistan ,  the imu's main aim was to overthrow the government of president islam karimov and establish an islamic state in uzbekistan . 
in <num>1999</num>  , the imu set up several military camps in northern afghanistan from where it launched incursions into southern kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan in <num>1999</num>  and <num>2000</num>  .
when nato forces invaded afghanistan in <num>2001</num>  , the imu announced its loyalty to the taliban and is believed to have suffered heavy losses fighting with the taliban against nato . 
but it successfully reorganised in the tribal areas of north and south waziristan over the following years . 
a former imu member told the bbc uzbek service that there were more than <num>100</num>  imu families in the tribal areas by the end of <num>2001</num>  .
islamabad authorities last month claimed that the army killed their leader ,  <num>42</num> -year-old tahir yuldashev ,  but his death has yet to be confirmed . 
experts say that the uzbeks were first targeted by pakistani security forces in march <num>2007</num>  when militants started attacking and killing pakistani soldiers and paramilitary troops . 
since then yuldashev's men have been accused of numerous suicide attacks . 
his militants carried out attacks on pakistani forces in the tribal belt and are believed to have taken part in the red mosque siege in <num>2007</num>  in which dozens of people were killed . 
pakistani security forces believe that some of the major bomb attacks in islamabad were the work of central asian militants .

kyrgyzstan - kyrgyz law enforcement agencies continue to arrest members of the banned group hizb ut-tahrir . 
<num>26</num>  , the interior ministrys press service reported that three people were arrested in osh and accused of extremist activities and membership in hizb ut-tahrir . 
they had earlier faced criminal prosecution for inciting religious strife . 
compact discs ,  videocassettes ,  brochures ,  posters ,  newspapers ,  leaflets and tickets to hizb ut-tahrir religious events were confiscated from the detained men . 
hizb ut-tahrir ,  however ,  espouses the establishment of a caliphate ,  a substantial threat to the secular government ,  and has incited and justified violence against them . 
latvian bank opens first foreign branch office in tajikistan
the opening of the latvian bank branch should make entry into the tajik market easier for western investors . 
 ( photo by denis sinyakov / afp / getty images ) 
tajikistan - latvia-based trasta komercbank  ( tkb )  has opened a banking outlet in this central asian country ,  marking the first time a european bank has opened a branch office on tajik soil . 
according to tkbs branch director in tajikistan ,  mustafo davlyatbekov ,  the opening will provide latvian investors with access to tajikistan's developing market ,  which has until now been largely closed to western companies . 
this summer ,  tkb managers organised a trip to tajikistan to coincide with the visit of the latvian president ,  who was in the central asian country to discuss the potential for transit shipments of tajik goods through latvia . 
tajik economists see the latvian bank branch opening as an opportunity for tajikistan to tap into the european market ,  and hope that the development will spur investment in the country's economy . 
according to economist karim ismatov ,  however ,  recent changes in tajikistan's laws may provide a less amenable climate for foreign investment . 
the parliament recently amended a law on the legal status of foreign citizens in tajikistan to bar aliens ,  with the exception of foreign diplomats ,  from buying property there . 
by limiting the sale of real-estate ,  we are closing the doors to outside investors ,  "  ismatov believes . 
pakistani army vows to eliminate taliban leadership in swat
everyone here dreads the prospect of a return of the taliban ,  said shamsher khan ,  <num>40</num>  , who is in the hotel business . 
taliban leadership must be eliminated to restore confidence among the people of swat . 
army officials concede that the insurgents have not been completely rooted out and there are still some strong pockets of resistance . 
the taliban are still present in some mountainous areas . 
while escapes by members of the top militant leadership are always a major cause of concern ,  army officers dismiss fears about the talibans return ,  saying there is no possibility of their regrouping . 
their capacity to regroup and launch major attacks has been destroyed ,  nadeem said . 
the army is going to stay in the area to ensure that the militants are not able to return . 
the <num>20</num>  most wanted list of taliban in swat is gradually being reduced as the current offensive has resulted in their death or arrest . 
the capture of five swat taliban shura members ,  including spokesman muslim khan and leading military commander mahmood khan has further weakened the militants . 
civilians who supported the militants in the past are rethinking their positions . 
we are ashamed we supported them . 
now the army should eliminate them .  "

islamabad - development of the dairy sector is essential to alleviating poverty in pakistan ,  according to vice chancellor of the university of veterinary and animal sciences  ( uvas )  in lahore dr muhammad nawaz . 
pakistan has the best breeds of  [ herd animals ]  ,  he said . 
the livestock sector has the potential to grow and we have to maximise the development of this resource . 
livestock contributes <num>12</num>  percent to pakistans gross domestic product ,  in comparison to eight percent in india . 
approximately <num>35</num>  million people are involved ,  directly or indirectly ,  with livestock ,  and the total value of the milk they produce is higher than the value of wheat and cotton ,  the countrys two major crops . 
australia will soon help change these statistics . 
its high commissioner said australia is ready to offer every possible help to pakistan to improve all aspects of its milk production and livestock productivity ,  and raise farmers standard of living . 
inadequate chilling facilities ,  increased energy costs ,  inefficient processing ,  costly packaging and distribution ,  however ,  remain impediments to the growth of pakistans dairy industry .

 ( photo :  alexander nemenov / afp / getty images ) 
astana - new id cards introduced a few months ago in kazakhstan are confusing border guards in neighbouring countries who have not been briefed on the new changes to kazakh identity documents . 
the kazakh ministry of justice unveiled the new identity documents mid-september . 
they are small plastic cards with microchips that store information about the holder ,  including a photograph ,  address and signature . 
it cost the government us$26 . 5 million to introduce the new id cards . 
over the next three years ,  all government institutions that work with the public will be provided with scanners to decipher all the information they contain . 
neighbouring countries kazakhs can enter without showing a passport are not yet familiar with the new arrangements ,  however . 
russian and kyrgyz border guards say that kazakh authorities did not inform them of the change ,  and they have therefore treated the new domestic id cards with suspicion . 
there have been more than <num>800</num>  victims of anti-personnel mines and unexploded ordnance in tajikistan since <num>1992</num>  , <num>354</num>  of whom died from their injuries . 
rasmussen says that the agency will have a staff of <num>16</num>  ministry of defence professional soldiers . 
it will be financed by the osce office in tajikistan ,  which has allocated it funds of almost us$8 million . 
according to ministry of defence figures ,  more than <num>800</num>  people ,  <num>354</num>  of whom subsequently died from their injuries ,  have been victims of anti-personnel mines and unexploded ordnance in tajikistan since <num>1992</num>  .
the tajik government has met all of its obligations under article four of the ottawa treaty ,  which stipulates that all stockpiled mines must be destroyed . 
the requirement that mines in all areas of the country be destroyed by next april <num>1</num>  will not be met . 
that objective will take an additional ten years to achieve and is expected to cost us$30 million .

the channel will project diverse aspects of pakistani folk music and theatre ,  its regional traditions ,  archaeology ,  history and many other areas ,  a ministry statement revealed . 
the culture channel will not only promote an understanding of pakistani cultures among people across the country ,  but educate viewers on the importance of preserving their rich cultural heritage ,  which will serve to counter extremist and terrorist ideologies . 
extremism and terrorism ,  however ,  are taking a toll on culture . 
some traditions have been curbed due to current circumstances . 
for example ,  rawalpindi district coordination officer imdadullah bosal imposed a ban on fireworks at wedding parties and suspended late night wedding functions in the district for security reasons . 
pakistan offers grants to halal exporters
a malaysian restaurant displays a certificate affirming that its food meets halal standards . 
 ( reuters ) 
karachi - the government of pakistan is offering financial support to exporters who want to obtain technical assistance and certification from international bodies to produce halal  ( islamic )  consumer products . 
the trade development authority of pakistan  ( tdap )  will fund half of the cost involved in obtaining halal products certification from accredited organisations ,  said tdap director-general javed anwar khan . 
the market for halal products in the world has increased to well over us$1 trillion ,  and pakistani exporters anticipate that they can capture a significant share by obtaining certification . 
the tdap has prescribed three conditions for financing certification costs . 
the applicant exporters must first select an internationally accepted halal product certification agency ,  complete all requirements and submit an audit report that authenticates the cost of certification ,  khan said . 
khan pointed out that there are <num>1.7</num>  billion muslims in the world who are potential consumers of halal products . 
pakistan has started a halal development project  ( hdp )  to enable all interested exporters obtain information for certification procedures and the best testing services available . 
in the new trade policy for <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  , the government has promised to support exporters in producing halal products ,  said sultan chawla ,  president of the federation of the pakistan chambers of commerce and industry . 
he encouraged exporters to take maximum advantage of this opportunity and capture their share in the fastest-growing halal markets in the world ,  to increase pakistans exports in the future .

thousands of taliban flee south waziristan
more than <num>5,000</num>  taliban have moved from south waziristan to north waziristan and adjoining tribal areas ,  said zahid khan ,  senator of the awami national party  ( anp )  ,  by telephone from peshawar . 
before the start of operation ,  there were an estimated <num>10,000</num>  militants in south waziristan . 
after completing operations in ladha and makeen ,  the military should be able to chase ttp leaders and their fighters in north waziristan and adjacent tribal areas ,  khan said . 
without eliminating the taliban from pakistani land ,  it will be impossible to maintain peace and security in the country . 
all political parties in pakistan must support the military operation to discourage militancy ,  he added . 
as they fled ,  some ttp commanders ordered their militants to stay in south waziristan ,  but the majority ignored them and gradually migrated to safer places ,  a security analyst in peshawar said . 
the sudden departure of thousands of militants created a split in the ranks of the ttp and weakened their resistance . 
ispr also reported that the military had taken control of <num>70</num>  percent of taliban areas in south waziristan . 
energy costs soar in kyrgyzstan
kyrgyzstans new prime minister daniyar usenov ,  often called a crisis manager in the media ,  has made the unpopular decision to raise electricity rates at the height of the winter season to save the energy industry . 
 ( photo by jacques collet / afp / getty images ) 
the governments decision drew sharp criticism from various circles . 
bishkek mayor nariman tuleyev criticised the plan ,  saying it failed to consider the social situation of most of the countrys citizens . 
he said more than <num>27,000</num>  residents in the capital work in state enterprises and earn less than us$100 a month . 
under the new rates ,  they will be required to pay between <num>100</num>  $  and <num>250</num>  $  per month for heating and hot water . 
usenov said the rates were increased due to losses in the energy industry and the need to modernise . 
inefficient uses of energy resulted in losses this year of <num>25</num>  percent of energy supplies . 
the new government energy development programme will cost approximately <num>1</num>  $  billion ,  including <num>700</num>  $  million to build new hydroelectric plants and power lines . 
usenov described the situation in the energy sector as catastrophic and said the government had to take immediate action .

 ( reuters / laura vera ) 
negotiations with world powers have soured and iran says it will build <num>10</num>  new enrichment plants . 
civilian nuclear power requires uranium enriched to about <num>3</num>  percent ,  but weapons grade uranium needs to be enriched to <num>90</num>  percent . 
iran claims that its nuclear programme is entirely for civilian purposes . 
nations trying to negotiate a deal with iran suggested its uranium enrichment for civilian nuclear energy could be regulated if iran handed over its uranium to russia to manage the process . 
but iran rejected the deal saying it would only agree to a simultaneous swap of fuel within its own borders . 
in his december <num>2</num>  address in isfahan ,  ahmadinejad said that the countries with which iran is negotiating ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  uk ,  france ,  germany ,  china and russia ,  known as the p5+1 ,  had imposed too many conditions . 
he condemned as  " illegal "  a resolution passed last week by the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  condemning its development of a uranium enrichment site in secret . 
ahmadinejad said israel and the west could not  " do a damn thing to stop iran's nuclear work "  . 
existing un sanctions are meant to prevent the flow of any items or technology that might aid iran in enriching uranium or developing nuclear weapon delivery systems . 
the sanctions range from actual sales or supplies to dealings with named individuals .

iran cracks down on student protests

tehran - iranian security forces cracked down hard on students who came out in support of the opposition on <abbr>dec.</abbr> 
<num>7</num>  , as the regime sought to limit media coverage of protests in tehran and beyond . 
video footage that managed to evade official censorship showed crowds chanting  " death to dictatorship "  and making v for victory signs on the campus of tehran university . 
state media confirmed there had been trouble ,  but blamed  " rioters who were not students "  clashing with police who surrounded the site . 
reports mentioned police using teargas ,  batons and stun guns to beat back demonstrators . 
mousavi issued a statement challenging the authorities . 
mehdi karroubi ,  the other defeated reformist presidential candidate ,  warned against a crackdown . 
the few foreign journalists still in tehran were ordered not to cover the protests . 
mobile phone networks were reportedly shut down . 
tehran residents complained for days of being unable to use email ,  while opposition websites were even more tightly restricted than before . 
protests were also reported at tehran's amir kabir university and at universities in mashhad ,  kermanshah and kerman . 
more demonstrations are planned to mark the ten-day shia festival of ashura that starts on <abbr>dec.</abbr> <num>18</num>  .
the latest protests ,  coming nearly six months after june's election ,  show again that the opposition movement is far from being crushed . 
it is also clear that the regime is prepared to wield ruthless force against it . 
afghan legal system gets a boost
millions of dollars are being poured into improving afghanistans judicial system . 
public information campaigns are also being run so residents are educated on their rights and the role of the local judiciary in helping to enforce them . 
a nationwide training programme and a public information campaign are being implemented by the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  development programme with funding from the european commission . 
the programme is targeting vulnerable groups such as returnees ,  women and children . 
donor countries have also supported afghan judicial reform programmes . 
for most of the judges ,  it was the first time in years they had received any formal training . 
when judges receive professional training ,  it will help reduce corruption throughout the country . 
earlier this year in kabul ,  <num>1,300</num>  recent graduates from all over afghanistan sat an entrance exam to determine if they were eligible to begin judicial training . 
compared to last year ,  the amount of people who sat the exam more than doubled . 
questions on the exam tested graduates understanding of different areas of the law from constitutional to commercial . 
the <num>200</num>  highest-scoring applicants were admitted as judicial candidates and they will begin a <num>36</num> -week training session . 
according to statistics from the canadian government ,  only around <num>12</num>  percent of afghan judges have university law degrees and only half received judicial training prior to their appointment . 
in many instances legal decisions are made based on personal opinion rather than referring to the afghan constitution . 
almost <num>80</num>  percent of legal claims are handled through community jirgas where there is no way to appeal or monitor a case . 
much has been done to create a strong legal system that communities can trust . 
in july <num>2007</num>  at the rome conference on rule of law in afghanistan ,  donors committed <num>360</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  over five years for programmes that will help strengthen afghanistans judicial system . 
the money will go towards programmes that will train judges and lawyers ,  and to construct police facilities and prisons . 
western diplomats increase pressure on iran
britain's un ambassador mark grant told reporters that discussions of new un sanctions would start  " at the beginning of the new year "  if tehran fails to reassure the world community about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme . 
his french counterpart gerard araud said ,   " we make a last call to iran to respond "  to security council demands . 
 " if iran does not <abbr>…</abbr>  france will present a new resolution of sanctions .  " 
according to <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ambassador susan rice ,   " the international community stands firm in its conviction that iran must comply with its international obligations . 
should iran continue to fail to meet its obligations ,  the international community will have to consider further actions .  " 
the panel gave details of two recent incidents in which vessels carrying arms-related materiel from iran to syria were intercepted by un member states . 
 " we are now convinced that there is a deliberate attempt by iran to violate the un resolutions .  " 
he also pointed out that all efforts by the six major powers  ( britain ,  china ,  france ,  germany ,  russia and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  )  to coax tehran into abandoning its nuclear enrichment programme had failed and that the patience of the six powers trying to clip iran's nuclear ambitions is running out .

kyrgyz officials eradicate cannabis crop
officials of the issyk-kul district administration in kyrgyzstan have been obliged to take part in the eradication of cannabis . 
so-called soft drugs ,  including marijuana and hashish ,  are being produced from within the republic .

salafism in kyrgystan :  armed jihad or muslim schism ? 
a kyrgyz muslim bows his head during a prayer service at a mosque during eid . 
salafists in kyrgyzstan are coming under increasing pressure . 
 [ getty images ] 
every year the list of banned organisations in kyrgyzstan grows . 
that list is reviewed and approved by the state commission on religious affairs and the supreme court . 
of the banned religious groups ,  the most dangerous are those that support the hisb ut-tahrir al-islami  ( the islamic party of liberation )  ,  he told central asia online . 
they are precisely the ones who most often appear in the ministry of internal affairs reports . 
it is another thing altogether that the members of the party have not yet gone any farther than distributing agitational materials . 
salafists are considered fundamentalists and osmonaliyev groups them with wahabbists . 
they oppose any pilgrimage to the graves of saints ,  deem celebration of the prophet muhammads birthday as something undesirable ,  believe in one god and do not recognise any innovation . 
but not everyone agrees . 
he insists that ,  so far ,  he has not encountered organized radical islamic movements in the country . 
a young man who gave his name as sartbek is one who ,  in the past ,  actively helped hizb ut-tahrir supporters distribute leaflets . 
he said he went to a sermon by chance after his friends invited him . 
no ,  there isnt anyone there who thinks this is wrong . 
if the mullah said that the quran should be interpreted like he says ,  then that is how it should be . 
oh yeah ,  we were asked to distribute leaflets . 
sometimes we just went into the entrance of a multi-storey apartment buildings and left newspapers at the door . 
did i meet representatives of other banned organisations ? 
no . 
personally ,  i did not meet anyone . 
malikov said that hisb ut-tahrir al-islamis supporters can be called moderate salafists . 
but osmonaliyev said the most frightening thing about salafism is the groups intended methods for coming to power :  armed jihad . 
according to osmonaliev ,  the first salafists appeared in kyrgyzstan seven years ago ,  but their influence has spread slowly . 
the movements leaders had more important work to do in places such as dagestan or chechnya . 
back then ,  in the beginning of this decade ,  they built several mosques here in our country that could become some sort of ideological centres . 
today we can say that <num>30</num>  percent of muslims in the country are of the salafat persuasion . 
additionally ,  the leaders of the organization are trying to work with residents in the north of the country because in the south there was no demand for the ideas of the wahabbists  ,  osmonaliev said . 
according to malikovs estimates ,  the salafists might be operating in <num>80</num>  countries around the world ,  with al-qaeda being the most aggressive organisation preaching this movement . 
osmonaliev said significant funding is coming from private sponsors in saudi arabia . 
attracting muslims with financial problems to their movement is their greatest weapon . 
theology teacher at kyrgyz national university evgenia nuranskaya said ,  there is no precise information on the amount of funding the salafists have ,  neither globally ,  nor in kyrgyzstan . 
banned religious organisations that are extremist - particularly wahhabi organisations ,  which include the salafists - are completely secretive about this information . 
the same goes for the number of supporters in the movement . 
another matter is what they could do in kyrgyzstan <abbr>…</abbr>   . 
osmonaliev suggested that the influence of salafists on the muslim community can be so grave that it leads to problems ,  such as mass psychosis . 
he said it is possible that there will be a schism among the kyrgyz diaspora because among those entering into the ranks of the salafists are the countrys young citizens . 
daniyar muradilov ,  an expert at the independent analytical research centre of religion ,  law and policy ,  said such fears are groundless :  such conflicts in the country have been noted ,  but at the level of the small diaspora . 
take ,  for example ,  uyghurs :  their older generations profess one approach to islam ,  but some young people have already become salafists . 
however ,  even there ,  no serious conflicts have come up-though ,  this is a theoretical possibility . 
on top of this ,  it is unlikely that salafists will be able to somehow destabilise the political situation in the country . 
we do not think that the movements supporters can make any claims on the countrys government . 
sartbek left the ranks of hizb ut-tahrir shortly before the so-called nookat case . 
he said he decided to continue his studies in one of the capitals universities and his major is not connected to religion : 
after i left ,  i started finding out that this was a party of illiterate imams . 
knowledgeable people say they have not read the quran and do not know the surahs . 
probably ,  this is the same for other similar organisations-maybe even for the salafists . 
the nookat case was the highest-profile trial involving supporters of banned religious groups . 
forty supporters of hizb ut-tahrir were tried . 
some of them received life terms in prison . 
whether or not the courts will go after the salafists is an unanswered question . 
but both malikov and osmonaliev agree that to identify the radicals among the islamic population of kyrgyzstan is ,  at present ,  impossible .  -
journalists in bishkek remember murdered colleague
bishkek - forty days after opposition reporter gennady pavlyuk died in a kazakh hospital ,  kyrgyz journalists honoured their murdered colleague even as the investigation into his death remains stalled and the threat of violence against journalists remains strong . 
nationwide ,  regional and national newspapers and websites have joined the commemoration of pavlyuks death on december <num>22</num>  by posting banners that read ,  we remember ! 
pavlyuk was found unconscious outside an apartment building in almaty ,  kazakhstan december <num>16</num>  .
unknown assailants had bound his hands and feet and thrown him from the sixth floor . 
he was taken to a hospital where he lay in a coma for six days before dying . 
kazakh police promptly began to investigate pavlyuks death ,  but have not reported any progress . 
oleq ivashenko ,  spokesman of the kazakhstan ministry of interior ,  said ,  the ministry cant comment on any details of the crime in the interests of the investigation . 
kazakh media reported in january that kyrgyz special services were involved in his death ,  but kazakh authorities have not confirmed any such involvement . 
kyrgyz authorities have denied any part in pavlyuks death . 
we cant speak on whether this crime was committed because of the victims professional activity . 
pavlyuks murder and the subsequent investigation have frustrated some analysts . 
of course our special services will deny it ,  said aziza abdyrasulova ,  director of the kylym shamy human rights organisation in kyrgyzstan . 
alexander knyazev ,  a russian political analyst in kyrgyzstan ,  called the murder a domestic political act committed in a neighbouring country . 
pavlyuks death has also highlighted the dangerous situation for kyrgyz journalists . 
a long list of threats directed at journalists and attacks on them has accumulated ,  including one instance in which a newspaper was sent a death threat that included a kalashnikov bullet . 
according to the organisation journalists ,  <num>11</num>  journalists were assaulted in kyrgyzstan in <num>2009</num>  , three of whom died . 
six kyrgyz journalists have received political asylum in western countries . 
recently the kyrgyz interior ministry reported to parliament that only one of the attacks was related to the victims profession . 
journalists chairman marat tokoev said ,  all our demands to have <abbr>…</abbr>   [ attackers of journalists ]  found and punished go unheeded . 
lower dir ,  pakistan -- at least ten people ,  including four school girls ,  were killed and <num>126</num>  others were wounded by a bomb placed near a girls school in tehsil balambat in lower dir february <num>3</num>  , news media reported . 
according to the daily jang ,  <num>70</num>  female students were among the <num>126</num>  wounded ,  who were sent to hospitals in peshawar ,  taimargara and swat . 
other children were believed killed in the blast ,  the newspaper report . 
the tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  has claimed responsibility for the blast ,  according to several news sources . 
video shot by local television showed significant damage to the school building ,  as rescuers dug through the rubble . 
one news report said a young girl was trapped under a collapsed wall . 
among the dead were three american soldiers travelling to another school as part of a humanitarian assistance program . 
ttp opposes the education of girls and considers it against their interpretation of shariah . 
afghan police thwart suicide bombing efforts
an afghan police officer looks for evidence after two would-be suicide bombers were killed march <num>8</num>  in khost . 
kabul ,  afghanistan - afghan police forces killed two male suicide bombers clad in womens burqas march <num>8</num>  in the south-eastern afghan province khost ,  provincial officials said . 
the attackers entered two buildings near the department of tribal affairs and tried to take hostages but the police acted quickly against the bombers and saved workers and other civilians . 
provincial officials said the hours-long battle with the suicide attackers left three policemen and three isaf soldiers with minor injuries . 
a taliban statement claimed there were five attackers ,  but no information on the alleged other three militants was available . 
taliban insurgents started launching multiple suicide attacks last year . 
since then ,  there have been three major coordinated attacks in kabul ,  at least two in khost ,  one in helmand and still others elsewhere . 
but the latest attacks that occurred in kabul ,  helmand and khost were unsuccessful as the police and army forces eliminated the attackers and minimized police and civilian casualties . 
usually insurgents use burqas ,  police or army uniforms and other disguises during such attacks ,  but afghan police have now proved their ability to thwart such efforts . 
some taliban have also resorted to wearing burqas to escape from afghan and other security forces . 
kyrgyz security forces huddle for protection behind shields on a bishkek street as opposition demonstrators pelt them with rocks april <num>7</num>  .
after two days of protests ,  the government collapsed . 
 [ maksat osmonaliyev ] 
bishkek - the kyrgyz government of president kurmanbek bakiyev collapsed april <num>7</num>  as thousands of opposition supporters around the country took to the streets and fought pitched battles with security forces ,  reportedly leaving hundreds of dead and wounded . 
prime minister daniyar usenov submitted his resignation late wednesday and turned control of the country over to the opposition ,  which named roza otumbayeva chair of the central executive committee of the peoples kurultai . 
the committee will serve as an interim government . 
bakiyevs whereabouts wednesday were unknown ,  and he reportedly sought asylum in a number of commonwealth of independent states countries but was refused . 
according to some reports ,  his plane returned to kyrgyzstan late wednesday and landed in osh . 
demonstrators took to the streets in the morning ,  and soon laid siege to the governments white house ,  the parliament ,  and other key government buildings . 
police who were already deployed began firing tear gas ,  rubber bullets ,  and live ammunition at the crowds . 
the demonstrations began april 6in the northern kyrgyz city of talas ,  after opposition leaders were arrested ahead of a nationwide opposition kurultai scheduled for april <num>7</num>  .
in talas ,  demonstrators seized the regional administration building and took the governor hostage . 
they were dispersed by police and special forces late tuesday night . 
wednesday ,  as opposition numbers in bishkek swelled and the crowds began to battle police ,  the opposition seized control of the main broadcast and transmission centre of the state television station ,  ktr ,  the only station on the air that day . 
however as an opposition leader was broadcasting a message ,  the signal was abruptly cut off . 
after that ,  the station broadcast an old soviet film until the signal again disappeared ,  and a number of opposition members appeared ,  saying they were negotiating with usenov about having him give up power . 
opposition forces also took control of the bishkek water treatment plant ,  and residents were advised to fill bathtubs and pots with water . 
the number of dead and injured continued to grow throughout the day . 
at one point in the evening an army armoured personnel carrier entered ala too square in bishkek and opened fire on the crowd . 
while the number of dead in bishkek was officially listed as <num>21</num>  , with <num>225</num>  wounded ,  a ministry of health official told central asia online wednesday evening there were some <num>300</num>  dead from ala too square alone and all medical services were engaged in removing the wounded . 
hospital officials reported a shortage of blood for treating victims . 
residents of naryn wanted to donate blood but reportedly found no way to reach blood banks ,  since public transit had ceased operating . 
the sudden collapse of bakiyevs government suggests that it had lost credibility with security forces as well as the public . 
one interior ministry source told central asia online that many members of the special forces and police did not report for duty wednesday . 
throughout the day ,  kyrgyz news media and businesses were closed ,  streets were blocked ,  and cellular telephone networks were overloaded and functioning poorly . 
as it became clear that the opposition was gaining the upper hand ,  temir sariev ,  an opposition leader ,  told central asia online the entire country is under our control - we have only the white house left to take . 
in the white house ,  usenov spent a dramatic day under siege ,  guarded by security forces . 
in mid-afternoon ,  before the white house was stormed ,  he issued a statement in the parliament that the situation was under control . 
later in the evening ,  as stated by the demonstrators who appeared on state tv ,  usenov met with opposition leaders to discuss a transition of power and his departure from the white house . 
throughout the country there were reports of similar uprisings . 
in talas ,  where demonstrations began tuesday ,  and in naryn the regional governments were reportedly under the control of the opposition early in the day ,  according to kumondor usupov ,  a reporter for radio azattyk . 
kurzubek imankulov ,  editor of the newspaper talas turmushu ,  said the opposition repelled over <num>500</num>  police officers and special forces troops ,  with a number of them beaten and being held as hostages . 
he said several police officers and one civilian died in the clash . 
central asia onlines correspondent from osh said the police were operating on a state of increased alert ,  with no uprisings yet in that town . 
however ,  the reporter said such events could take place april <num>8</num>  .
in dzhalal-abad and agsy ,  the opposition reportedly took power ,  while in batken the situation remained calm . 
bakiyev came to power in the <num>2005</num>  tulip revolution after then-president askar akayev was forced from power .

according to experts ,  europe has shown renewed interest in working with the countries of central asia ,  largely as a result of the regions energy resources . 
according to independent observers ,  kazakhstan is the undeniable leader among cis countries in the rapid pace of its adoption of markets and the transformation of its domestic economy . 
this process was expedited by several factors :  the creation of guarantees for private property and the inviolability of contracts ,  the effective privatisation of state assets ,  strong efforts to attract foreign capital ,  and political and social stability inside the country . 
all of these factors have helped to boost economic growth ,  including in the energy sector . 
among cis countries ,  kazakhstan has already crept up to second place behind russia in per capita gdp and purchasing power parity . 
kazakhstans economic partnerships with other nations unfold on multiple levels-including the areas of financial operations ,  trade in manufactured and agricultural products ,  the development of transportation projects ,  labour resource exchanges ,  <abbr>etc.</abbr> 
nevertheless ,  the centrepiece of kazakhstans external market activity is the export of its energy resources ,  the engine which drives kazakhstans economic growth . 
french president and european commission president nicolas sarkozy leaves the government buildings in dublin ,  after a lunch with irish prime minister brian cowen  ( not pictured )   ,  on july <num>21</num> 
it is precisely this energy factor that underpins kazakhstan's active and broad cooperation with the countries of the eu . 
at their core ,  kazakhstan's energy policies reflect the principles of transparent contracts and business dealings ,  the predictability and security of deliveries ,  and the modernisation and expansion of transport routes . 
moreover ,  kazakhstan's leadership has not ruled out taking part in other alternate-route projects ,  for example ,  the constanta  ( romania ) -trieste  ( italy )  pipeline . 
meeting with kazakhstan's minister of energy and mineral resources in the spring of <num>2006</num>  , belgian chamber of representatives president de croo explained ,   " we want to have access to more than one supplier of energy resources in order to ensure our energy security .  " 
in terms of corporate interest in kazakhstan ,  it's worth noting the presence of major european players such as totalfina ,  agip ,  eni ,  shell ,  british gas and british petroleum ,  all of which currently operate in kazakhstan . 
it's worth pointing out that germany was essentially the first european country to recognise central asia's potential in areas of security as well as the region's energy resources . 
today ,  all the prerequisite conditions are in place to ensure that relations between kazakhstan and the european union develop in both a sustainable and dynamic fashion . 
kanat berentayev ,  head researcher for the institute for global economy and policy ,  noted that france's presidency in the eu will not sidestep issues of cooperation with central asia . 
the analyst points to the visit of france's prime minister to kazakhstan in <num>2008</num>  and nursultan nazarbayev's visit to paris in june of this year ,  as evidence of france's growing interest in the region . 
and ,  according to berentayev ,  kazakhstan has been granted a leading role in this dialogue with the european union . 
bishkek -- interim government deputy chairman omurbek tekebayev announced april <num>22</num>  that a national referendum on a new constitution will be held june <num>27</num>  , while parliamentary - and possibly presidential - elections will take place october <num>10</num>  .
it was an announcement analysts had been waiting for . 
the interim government is doing the right thing ,  because time is of the essence ,  and we must quickly begin functioning on a legal basis ,  said zholbors zhorobekov ,  professor of political science at the kyrgyz national university . 
the situation that currently exists has not existed anywhere else or at any other time in the history of the cis ,  and this situation must be resolved as soon as possible . 
if we dont establish legitimacy today ,  tomorrow someone can say that were not legitimate . 
and this would have catastrophic consequences for the country . 
setting dates for elections gives kyrgyzstan the appearance of moving toward a more democratic form of government ,  but zhorobekov said it would be oversimplifying to label it as such . 
as for the democratic nature of these events - the elections and the referendum - they of course are not <num>100</num>  %  democratic . 
if <num>52</num>  %  vote in the referendum for a parliamentary republic and <num>48</num>  %  for a presidential republic ,  the will of the majority will still have to be obeyed ,  zhorobekov said . 
so we can say with relative confidence that there wont be any serious violations or manipulation . 
i feel this will not be repeated .

hakeemullah mehsud vows revenge for the deaths of pakistani taliban fighters in a nine-minute video released may <num>3</num>  .
hakeemullah refers to april <num>19</num>  as the date of the video ,  dispelling earlier reports that a january missile strike killed him . 
his survival ,  if confirmed ,  is bad news for pakistani authorities . 
they have struggled to crush a three-year campaign of audacious bombings that has confirmed the ttps status as the greatest threat to the countrys security . 
he had been thought killed by a january <num>14</num>  missile strike in south waziristan . 
the last time hakeemullah appeared in a video was in january this year ,  when he was seen with humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi ,  the jordanian bomber who killed seven cia employees in khost last december . 
it was an open lie and propaganda by kuffar  ( non-believers )  ,  hakeemullah ,  <num>31</num>  , said of reports of his death . 
the second video features a voice identified as hakeemullahs with animated explosions over a map of the united states . 
the voice ,  speaking in urdu ,  promises good news will be heard within some days or weeks . 
last week several pakistani intelligence officials told news media that they now believe hakeemullah is alive ,  but they suggested that he is no longer as influential in the ttp as he previously was . 
the pakistani military declined to comment until intelligence agencies verify the authenticity of the video in which hakeemullah appears . 
we are analysing the video ,  and unless there is a report from  ( inter services intelligence and military intelligence )  ,  it is too early to comment on <abbr>…</abbr>  the video ,  major-general athar abbas ,  spokesman for the pakistani military ,  told central asia online . 
hakeemullah took command of the ttp last august after his predecessor ,  baitullah mehsud ,  was killed in a missile strike on his father-in-laws home in south waziristan . 
the ttp is aligned with al-qaeda . 
the outlawed militant organisation has accepted responsibility for many major terror attacks ,  including one on the us consulate in peshawar in april . 
hakeemullah and his men moved to safe havens in north waziristan after military operations in neighbouring south waziristan dislodged them from strongholds there . 
constitution comment period ends
a woman photographs the ransacked kyrgyz parliament hall in bishkek april <num>8</num>  .
with the comment period closing may <num>14</num>  , the constitutional conference is beginning work on a final draft that faces a referendum june <num>27</num>  .
 [ vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ] 
bishkek - as the public comment period on the new constitution closes may <num>14</num>  , differing viewpoints have emerged ,  not only among the public but within the interim government and constitutional conference . 
two thousand phone calls and many more letters and emails have broached whether to separate state and religion ,  allow parliamentary deputies to switch parties ,  and rename kyrgyzstan . 
interim vice prime minister and conference chairman omurbek tekebayev called the process and conference structure unprecedented . 
there are only two politicians from the interim government in the conference ,  and two more from the judicial system . 
all the other members are high-profile public leaders ,  representatives of the civil and non-governmental sectors ,  he said . 
the <num>75</num> -member conference has divided into four groups addressing human rights ,  governance ,  local self-governance and the judicial system . 
the first line of the draft constitution ,  which declares kyrgyzstan to be a secular state ,  has raised a fundamental issue . 
tekebayev proposed deleting the line . 
the word secular was written in so as to separate the state from religion ,  he said . 
i think all the necessary norms to separate religion from politics and governance are fully covered in other articles . 
certain members of the constitutional conference say you cant have a constitution without god ,  she said . 
but we think this will lead to the islamisation of the country . 
conference secretary daniyar narimbayev said many kyrgyz are uncomfortable with eliminating the reference to a secular state . 
nevertheless ,  the conference voted <num>44</num> -<num>25</num>  to delete it . 
suggestions from civil society mostly addressed human rights concerns and transparency in the workings of parliament and the executive branch . 
political parties proposed that the system of proportional representation not be limited . 
they also suggested electing deputies to represent specific districts and increasing the number of deputies to <num>130</num>  from <num>120</num>   ( or <num>105</num>  )  . 
another proposal would allow deputies to quit their party and join another without losing their seats . 
perhaps one of the most unusual proposals was to change the name of kyrgyzstan ,  put forward by arslanbek maliyev . 
he heads aalam ,  an independent party . 
we need to leave behind the -stan suffix ,  which has a negative connotation . 
the conference will consider public comments and publish a draft constitution may <num>20</num>  .
it is scheduled for a referendum june <num>27</num>  .
islamic conference foreign ministers meet in dushanbe

dushanbe -- foreign ministers from the islamic world gathered in dushanbe may <num>18</num>  to open 37t annual conference of the organisation of the islamic conference . 
the foreign ministers meeting marks the first time a cis central asian country has hosted the meeting . 
the agenda reads like a whos-who of islamic conflicts ;  the middle east conflict ,  the afghan situation ,  iraq ,  the kashmir dispute ,  somalia ,  cyprus ,  and kosovo . 
the oics future role in regulating conflicts in its member-states ,  providing security and keeping the peace in the islamic world is under discussion . 
the conference runs through may <num>20</num>  .
in his opening remarks ,  tajik president emomali rakhmon said hosting the conference is a great honour for tajikistan . 
the only other cis state to host an oic meeting was azerbaijan in <num>2006</num>  .
the issue of afghanistan was raised almost immediately by rakhmon ,  who said neighbours borders with afghanistan are the front lines of combat and warned that the afghan conflict cannot be resolved by military means alone . 
he also called for social ,  educational and cultural programmes . 
what afghanistan needs now is a transition from armed resistance to a constructive basis ,  he said . 
the oic should also help the kyrgyz people decide their own fate ,  he said . 
speeches aside ,  tajik analysts expressed certainty that the oic would be unable to meet the goals it set for itself . 
many have dismissed the oic as an islamic debating society that has accomplished little ,  citing a lack of unified positions on key issues and no agencies transform policies into action . 
if the oic could unify and present a single political position for all <num>57</num>  members ,  it could be one of the strongest and most influential political blocs on the world stage ,  said tajik political scientist abdullo rakhnamo . 
but the member-states of the oic dont have a unified position on any of their main issues . 
the oic members positions on problems like the near east conflict or recognition of kosovar independence are formed under the influence of the leading world powers international positions . 
russias position exerts influence on the position taken by the central asian countries <abbr>…</abbr>  theres also no unified position on the anti-terrorist operation in afghanistan ,  he said . 
internal conflicts between member-states also influence the oics positions ,  political scientist rustam samiyev said . 
ideologies to which individual states are wedded play a role too ,  he added . 
islamic countries must note western states emerging unity ,  rahknamo said ,  and narrow their differences "  ,  if they want to have an influence on the future course of geo-politics . 
tajikistan gained the attention of the oic in the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  when the organisation monitored the peace treaty ending the <num>1992</num> -<num>1997</num>  civil war ,  said khikmatullo saifullozoda ,  chief of analysis for the islamic renaissance party . 
 " conducting this meeting speaks like nothing else for tajikistan's positions in international relations when it's in a period of opaque relations with russia and uzbekistan ,  which play leading roles in central asia "  ,  he said . 
in the past five years ,  tajikistan has succeeded in building good relations with active oic members -- saudi arabia ,  qatar ,  kuwait ,  the uae ,  egypt and algeria ,  rakhnamo said . 
in addition ,  the oic named dushanbe a capital of islamic culture for <num>2010</num>  .
 " this shows that tajikistan has achieved positive results in the islamic orientation of its foreign policy "  ,  he said . 
another reason to court the oic is its potential to become a major investor in the tajik economy ,  rakhnamo said ,  something rakhmon alluded to in his speech . 
 " the islamic assistance fund  ( which has us <num>10</num>  $  billion in capital )  and the creation of a special department for rendering humanitarian aid in emergencies vividly demonstrate the oic's  ( capacity for )  practical steps "  ,  he said . 
the oic includes <num>56</num>  countries and the palestinian authority . 
their combined population is us$2 billion . 
the members have us$5 trillion in combined economic potential . 
yet tajik analysts say the organisation is passive and divided by its member-states' differing geopolitical views . 
kyrgyz draft constitution ready
the draft constitution to be voted on in a june <num>27</num>  referendum is discussed by  ( left to right )  human rights activist cholpon dzhakupova ,  acting finance minister temir sariyev ,  and acting primeminister omurbek tekebayev at a bishkek press conference may20 . 
 [ aibek karabayev ] 
bishkek -- after a month-and-a-half of preparation ,  kyrgyzstans interim government approved a draft constitution may <num>20</num>  .
but the kyrgyz people will still have the last word ,  when the draft goes to voters in a june <num>27</num>  referendum . 
the party winning the most votes in the election will get <num>65</num>  seats . 
the remaining <num>55</num>  seats will go to the remaining parties that cleared the <num>5</num>  %  threshold  ( for having any seats in parliament )  "  ,  constitutional conference chairman daniyar narymbayev said . 
the constitutional court will become the constitutional chamber ,  and the phrase  " kyrgyzstan - a secular state "  will remain in the constitution ,  per the wishes of the interim government's members . 
human rights activists won a provision on limiting the extradition of criminals ,  acting deputy prime minister omurbek tekebayev said . 
 " we suggested that kyrgyzstan not extradite criminals to other countries if there was concern they would suffer torture or if we could not be certain of  ( the criminals' )  safety "  ,  said aziza abdurasulova ,  chairwoman of the kylym shamy human rights organisation . 
one article -  " on the transitional period "  - was added at the last minute . 
the transition period will continue until january <num>1</num>  , <num>2012</num>  , tekebayev said . 
 " yesterday ,  we affirmed by decree that interim leader roza otunbayeva will be the transitional president . 
we'll put this decree to the voters in the june referendum "  ,  tekebayev said . 
the constitutional assembly didn't approve any such amendments concerning a  ' transitional period '  . 
this point didn't exist and can't exist "  . 
several rights activists said may <num>19</num>  they knew about the introduction of major changes into the constitution . 
members of the committee for civilian oversight ,  which was unrepresented in the constitutional conference ,  warned the interim government against taking such a step . 
one member of the committee ,  nurbek toktabunov ,  promised to sue over the matter . 
 " it isn't <num>1917</num>  , when you could run the country by decrees "  ,  he said . 
 " if you declare a transitional period ,  you need a reason to do it . 
there isn't any "  . 
 " otunbayeva will be president  ( subject to voter approval in june )  during the transitional period ,  which ends january <num>1</num>  , <num>2012</num>  "  ,  he said . 
 " the presidential election takes place in october <num>2011</num>  .
she is making a major political sacrifice for the sake of the country's stability "  . 
fazlullah-led militants attack eastern afghan province
armed pakistani militants loyal to pro-taliban cleric mullah fazlullah stand at a captured police station at matta in swat district in this <num>2007</num>  photo . 
mullah fazlullah reportedly attacked eastern afghanistans nuristan province may <num>24</num>  .
 [ str / afp / getty images ] 
mullah fazlullah is leading the militants ,  most of them pakistanis . 
our brave police are fighting with them . 
so far two policemen and seven militants have been killed in the fighting . 
the police are encouraged by young people of the province who volunteered to help the government in the fighting ,  the governor said . 
but pakistani senior journalist and analyst ,  rahimullah yusufzai ,  questions jamaluddins claim . 
this is something unbelievable ,  yusufzai told central asia online by phone . 
he doubts that the attack is being led by fazlullah because his men are reportedly in orakzai agency . 
yusufzai ,  who has covered afghan issues for some time ,  said ,  we never heard that the swat taliban are strong enough to fight on their own in afghanistan . 
he added that the afghan taliban are commanded by dost muhammad and are fighting government troops in nuristan and elsewhere . 
some two weeks ago omar hasan aarabi ,  spokesman for mullah fazlullah ,  called me and told me that their leader is fine and on this  ( the pakistani )  side of the border . 
yusufzai said that mullah fazlullah called reporters some months ago and said he escaped to afghanistan . 
he said the swat taliban first went to bajaur ,  then to mohmand and that now most of them are in orakzai agency . 
jamaluddin asked the central afghan government to send additional police and weapons to the district to help defeat the militants . 
taliban attack fails to disrupt afghan peace jirga
delegates to the afghan peace jirga in kabul listen to a speaker june <num>2</num>  .
a taliban attack failed to disrupt the three-day meeting . 
 [ abdulhadi hairan ] 
kabul - taliban militants attacked the peace jirga in kabul minutes after president hamid karzai opened the event june <num>2</num>  .
about <num>1,500</num>  participants ,  mostly pro-government ,  are in kabul for three days to discuss karzais plan for reconciliation with militants and to identify which groups to target for outreach . 
the jirga has been criticised by some because karzais opponents and militant groups were not invited to participate . 
some have said the jirga cannot accomplish much without the participation of all parties and say karzai is using the meeting to solidify his position after a flawed presidential election . 
immediately after karzai opened the jirga and started listing the agenda for the three-day event ,  a rocket landed just <num>100</num>  meter  away from the german-donated tent . 
karzai calmly told participants to continue their discussions without worrying about security and proceeded with his speech . 
at the end ,  when he invited the taliban to give up violence and join the government in building the country and helping the people ,  the participants heard gunfire nearby ,  but refused to call off the jirga . 
after the presidents departure ,  former afghan president sibghatullah mujaddedi announced that another former president ,  burhanuddin rabbani ,  will chair the discussions . 
mujaddedi accused pakistan of supporting the taliban and asked the insurgents to stop killing afghans . 
rocket explosions were audible during his speech ,  but he continued .

during the second session of the jirga ,  one of the organisers ,  farooq wardak ,  provided details of what the participants heard . 
he further said that security forces quickly killed one attacker and captured another . 
he condemned the militants actions and said they failed to disrupt the jirga . 
a taliban spokesman ,  zabiullah mujhadi ,  calling from an undisclosed location ,  claimed responsibility for the attack and said the terrorist group had dispatched four combatants to disrupt the jirga . 
kazakhstan softens stance on georgian-russian conflict after rushing to blame georgia
kazakhstan has softened its position on the georgian-russian conflict over the breakaway province of south ossetia ,  after initial accusations of wrongdoing against georgia . 
the georgian leadership was not right when it did not inform  [ other cis leaders ]  and did not speak about the escalation there  [ in south ossetia ]  ,  nazarbayev said . 
there is still no alternative to a peaceful solution to the conflict ,  he suggested . 
that is why we welcome the russian and georgian presidents statements about the cessation of hostilities and the start of negotiations . 
we hope that these negotiations will be successful and will not allow such bloodshed in the future ,  nazarbayev said . 
the cis as an international organisation should not stand aside from solving the conflict ,  the kazakh presidential press service said in a press release on the kazakh-kyrgyz meeting . 
if cis countries do not take joint measures to stabilise the situation in the conflict zone ,  this may lead to an insurmountable crisis in the cis . 
speaking on the georgian-russian conflict at the polyton discussion club in almaty on august <num>15</num>  , kazakh political journalist yaroslav razumov blamed the change in the kazakh position on the conflict on the usual practices adopted by the countrys leadership . 
this is a manifestation of the political techniques of our leaders ,  razumov said . 
as usual ,  our leadership waited for the situation to develop and then softened its position . 
wedding suicide attack kills dozens
resident of nagahan village ,  in southern kandahar province ,  mourn the death of more than <num>40</num>  killed at a wedding party . 
the kandahar governor says the village is being punished for anti-taliban activities . 
 [ abdulhadi hairan ] 
the suicide bomber struck around 9pm as guests were eating their last meal of the day . 
there were mixed reports whether the bomber had used a minivan laden with explosives ,  or entered the wedding tent wearing a suicide vest . 
some guests were government employees ,  but the majority of the dead were civilians . 
taliban terrorists probably attacked the wedding party because the entire village opposed their activities and supported the reconstruction programmes of the government ,  the governor added . 
some village residents had helped the government and coalition forces kill a taliban commander responsible for many attacks in the province ,  local officials told central asia online . 
the terrorists may have wanted to punish the whole village for their commander . 
president hamid karzai ,  human rights organisations and civil society groups condemned the attack as inhumane and brutal . 
an international coalition airstrike caused the carnage ,  militant spokesman qari yousaf ahmadi told media . 
the taliban wants to hide their crimes by giving wrong information ,  he said . 
doctors at mirwais hospital in kandahar ,  where the wounded were sent ,  told the media a suicide attack caused the injuries they treated . 
the arghandab district is located <num>15</num>  kilometer  north of kandahar and has seen increased taliban activity in recent weeks .

osh - ethnic clashes between uzbeks and kyrgyz continued in osh and surrounding areas june <num>12</num>  , bringing the death toll to <num>63</num>  .
another <num>835</num>  were injured . 
the number of dead is maybe even three times more than the official number ,  as there are a number of streets in the city that we cant get to ,  and im sure there are more dead there ,  a ministry of health representative said . 
he said another problem is that the hospitals in southern kyrgyzstan dont have enough doctors and food for the wounded . 
bishkek is sending assistance ,  but we need more . 
we asked the  ( world health organisation )  to help us ,  he said . 
interim government head rosa otunbayeva told journalists ,  there are far more victims than we know . 
she said the interim government is trying to provide needed supplies to osh . 
rioters destroyed numerous buildings ,  cars and stores . 
they tried to gain control of border guard munitions ,  and as a result one border guard died . 
they also got a number of our military cars ,  sharshenaliyev said . 
a number of our people died ,  and some attacks on doctors were registered . 
a state of emergency was declared in osh and surrounding areas ,  but clash participants ignored it . 
a central asia online correspondent said a number of his uzbek neighbours were killed ,  raped and wounded . 
there are victims both from uzbek and kyrgyz sides . 
an osh police representative ,  who identified himself as askar ,  said the police and special forces who arrived from bishkek arent enough . 
we need help ;  there are too many of them . 
otunbayeva said kyrgyzstan needs third forces ;  therefore ,  she talked to russian premier vladimir putin to ask for help . 
right now ,  though ,  russia doesnt see a reason to come to kyrgyzstan . 
russian presidential press secretary natalya timakova said that before russia can go to kyrgyzstan ,  the collective security treaty organisation would have to consult the un . 
people in osh still are without electricity and gas . 
they also are afraid to drink tap water ,  fearing it might be contaminated . 
all the shops and bazaars are closed ,  as is the airport . 
people are trying to flee the city for the villages . 
ethnic uzbeks gathered on the border ,  trying to flee to uzbekistan . 
our neighbour was killed . 
how do we know that we are not next ? 
we have to leave the country for the safety of our families . 
cholponbek turusbekov ,  the head of the border guard of kyrgyzstan ,  said the dostuk and ak-buura checkpoints on the border were opened so the refugees could get to uzbekistan . 
singing for peace
music lovers shop at a cd market setup on the sidewalks in peshawar . 
the new generation of singers is including a different message in their compositions . 
 [ shaheen buneri ] 
peshawar ,  pakistan :  along the pakistan-afghan border - in the grip of war and violence ,  while the pashtun culture is under fire from militants ,  some young pashto singers use their music to openly challenge religious fundamentalism . 
contrary to the past ,  when pashtu poetry was primarily an embodiment of romantic thoughts and feelings ,  todays literary and musical pursuits hearken to the themes of war ,  migration ,  death and destruction . 
the change is noticeable in the new songs by budding singers who lament the negative impacts of the ongoing war and yearn for peace and stability in the region . 
the songs have gained popularity on both sides of the durand line . 
the song is in great demand in the broadcasts of local radio and tv channels ,  both in pakistan and afghanistan ,  khan said . 
art critics say that ,  since <num>2001</num>  , the socio-cultural scene in the region has changed . 
the taliban destroyed music shops and discouraged musical performances ,  but that has proved to be a blessing in disguise . 
the aggressive campaign against pashtun culture inflamed a renewed passion in the artistic and literary circles to fight for their survival . 
this attitude led to the composition of songs that tells about the past glory of the land and the need for practical work to defeat religious extremism at all levels ,  said usman ulasyar ,  chairman of the suvastu arts and cultural society . 
bakhtyar khattak ,  <num>30</num>  , is a pashto singer with a masters degree in business . 
he works for a pashto tv station in peshawar as anchorperson and music director . 
in <num>2003</num>  , he started his music career by singing romantic songs ,  but in <num>2007</num>  he devoted himself to singing for his land and people . 
as a singer i know the importance of my role in creating awareness among the people about the social and political issues that affect their lives . 
if you remember ,  the taliban first attacked music shops and musicians before establishing their authority in pashtun areas of afghanistan and pakistan . 
they did so because they knew pashtuns loved music and singers were the real opposition to their extremist ideology ,  he said . 
khattak said he believes that the newly composed patriotic songs played a more important role in denting the image of the taliban and exposing their true nature to the pashtuns than military operations . 
khattak composed a series of songs about peshawar ,  the sufferings of the displaced people from swat and pakistan tribal areas and a poem inciting pashtuns to respect their traditions and social values and not to be influenced by the negative propaganda of the religious bigots . 
modern technology helps popularize songs as people share them through mobile phones ,  computers and on social networks on the internet . 
according to some social scientists ,  this new trend among pashtun singers may lead to the re-awakening of national consciousness among the pashtuns . 
it is interesting that pashto singers perform this important duty by their own with no encouragement from the governmental and non-governmental organizations and they must be appreciated for this ,  he said . 
suicide bombers kill <num>59</num>  at pakistani arms factory
the associated press reports suicide bombers killed <num>59</num>  people at a huge arms factory <abbr>aug.</abbr> 
<num>21</num>  in one of pakistan's deadliest terror attacks ,  adding to turmoil from political squabbling that is threatening to tear apart the ruling coalition now that pervez musharraf has quit as president . 
workers were streaming through two gates of the sprawling factory complex in wah ,  <num>20</num>  miles west of islamabad ,  during a shift change at about <num>2</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr>  when the bombers attacked outside the walls . 
the force of the explosions knocked many people to the ground and sprayed others with shrapnel . 
 " it was like a doomsday ,  "  said ghaffar hussain ,  whose nephew was killed . 
tanvir lodhi of the pakistan ordnance factories said <num>59</num>  people died . 
seventy others were wounded ,  said mohammed azhar ,  a hospital official . 
more bombings will be carried out in major cities ,  including the capital and the southern metropolis of karachi ,  unless the offensives are halted ,  he said . 
prime minister yousaf raza gilani appealed to lawmakers to urgently draw up a national strategy against terrorism  " even if you have to sit together for a week .  " 
the attack in wah was the country's deadliest since former prime minister benazir bhutto narrowly escaped a double suicide bombing in karachi that killed about <num>150</num>  people at a parade welcoming her back from exile in october .

the russian company severstal has acquired kazakh gold-mining firm balazhal ,  which operates in east kazakhstan . 
according to a company spokesperson ,  one of severstal's subsidiaries acted as a <num>100</num>  percent buyer of the company . 
balazhal's total recoverable gold reserves are estimated at <num>20</num>  tons ,  with potential for increasing these reserves to <num>30</num> -<num>40</num>  tons . 
a mine and an enrichment facility for gold extraction were constructed in <num>2004</num>  , but processing came to a standstill by the end of <num>2006</num>  due to financial constraints . 
severstal is also russia's second-largest coal producer . 
a gold-mining subsidiary structure was created within severstal-resource in <num>2007</num>  that produced <num>5.3</num>  tons of gold in that year . 
russian investment in kazakhstan's economy is not limited to gold mining ,  however . 
the russian company gazprom oil is planning its own chain of roadside gas stations in kazakhstan . 
the gazprom subsidiary company aims to buy up filling stations to create its own network . 
petroleum shortages in kazakhstan are projected to be filled by shipping the output of a refinery in omsk . 
oao gazprom oil is one of russia's leading petroleum producers ,  combining extraction ,  refinery and retail operations . 
in total oil production volumes the company is russia's fifth largest . 
the fund's founding shareholders were kazakh investment company kazyna capital management ,  mongolia's ministry of industry and trade ,  and the foreign investment and trade agency of mongolia . 
press freedom becomes an issue in pakistan
peshawar - intimidation of the media has become a serious issue in pakistan . 
journalists ,  however ,  are vowing not to give in to the threats . 
the country's rampant violence made pakistan one of the deadliest environments in the world last year for reporters ,  the paris-based reporters without borders said . 
in <num>2009</num>  , <num>7</num>  journalists were killed in pakistan ;  four of the deaths them have been confirmed beyond any doubt as resulting from their work . 
in the past <num>18</num>  days ,  the  " taliban media centre "  in north waziristan has issued death threats to journalists . 
one emailed threat ,  dated april <num>23</num>  , said :   " this should be considered a last warning <abbr>…</abbr>  if the media don't stop working as an ally of the government and army ,  then the taliban will treat them as they want to be treated "  . 
 " the journalistic community is taking these threats very seriously "  ,  pervaiz shaukat ,  president of the pakistan federal union of journalists  ( pfuj )  ,  told central asia online . 
journalists and the international community in islamabad held unprecedented activities on this year's world press freedom day ,  may <num>3</num>  , to show their concern . 
reporters held local workshops and demonstrations ,  while the islamabad-based eu delegation to pakistan organised a discussion for reporters ,  activists and government officials . 
 " the press has  ( long )  been under attack by different pressure groups in pakistan "  ,  mazhar abbas ,  press freedom activist and former pfuj general secretary ,  said . 
 " the danger now is that we see armed pressure groups who want you to  ( parrot )  their viewpoint "  . 
however ,  the attention devoted to intimidation of the media was  " encouraging "  ,  he added . 
adnan rehmat ,  head of the media watchdog group intermedia ,  agreed . 
 " the media are becoming better organised in protesting attacks on themselves "  ,  he said . 
however ,  he lamented the failure to punish those who kill journalists . 
 " threats to journalists seem to be snowballing <abbr>…</abbr>  seven were killed in the past <num>12</num>  months "  . 
many reporters fear that  " they are being left on their own to face the consequences "  ,  shaukat said . 
outraged reporters  " organised a rally of <num>100</num>  motorists from islamabad to lahore "  ,  he recalled . 
 " it was a unique experience when journalists from small towns <abbr>…</abbr>  joined the rally "  . 
the drivers took <num>12</num>  hours to cover the <num>400</num>  kilometer  in their effort to publicise their plight . 
journalists describe the situation in the militancy-wracked tribal areas as unbearable . 
most have fled the danger ;  those who remain cannot risk practising independent journalism . 
five journalists have been killed in bajaur ,  north waziristan and south waziristan since february <num>2005</num>  , according to the tribal union of journalists  ( tuj )  . 
reporters from seven tribal districts gathered in islamabad april <num>30</num>  to discuss threats ,  the behaviour of security forces ,  and the poor wages and lack of training provided by their employers . 
the beleaguered tribal journalists sought to spotlight their ordeal ,  which they said the national media has failed to cover . 
 " we are here to let you know under what circumstances tribal journalists work "  ,  tuj general secretary safdar dawar said at the meeting . 
the militants' threats and attacks might reflect desperation . 
since may ,  when the army launched a  " decisive "  offensive against them in the swat valley - followed by an offensive in south waziristan in october - the national media have denied insurgents any publicity . 
insurgent violence against reporters indicates a desire to stage a comeback in the media at any cost ,  some analysts say . 
what is public health in uzbekistan ? 
healthcare in uzbekistan can be costly . 
 ( photo ipd ) 
according to uzbekistans constitution ,  each of its citizens has a right to free ,  qualified medical care . 
in reality ,  however ,  things are otherwise . 
a man who has a direct professional relationship with the problem has told the ferghana . 
ru news agency how ,  in particular ,  things stand in terms of medical care in the uzbek part of the fergana valley . 
in all the regions of uzbekistan ,  emergency medical centres  ( emcs )  have been set up which are obliged to provide free assistance to people seven days a week  ( but currently in fact only do so for five days a week )  . 
in accordance with the law ,  a patient must be given emergency assistance and stabilised ,  and then sent on to another medical facility for further treatment . 
if the patient is not mobile he is to be transferred in an ambulance . 
with respect to surgical interventions ,  here the costs are much more serious . 
for any operation it is necessary to pay both the surgeon and his team - and to pay individually for medicines ,  a hospital bed ,  and food . 
on average ,  the cost of an urgent operation is from <num>50</num>  $  to <num>150</num>  $  .
of course ,  this is an order of magnitude less than such care would cost in kazakhstan or russia ,  but life in the fergana valley is at the poverty level . 
some <num>50</num>  percent of the population in the valley simply cannot afford that kind of money .

islamabad ,  pakistan :  - the supreme court of pakistan declared the national reconciliation ordinance  ( nro )  unconstitutional december <num>16</num>  , reviving all cases of corruption ,  misuse of power and embezzlement abolished under this law .

reacting to the court decision ,  zardaris spokesman farhatullah babar told reporters that the peoples party respects the court verdict . 
however ,  babar said zardari has immunity under article <num>248</num>  of pakistans constitution . 
there is no question of president zardaris resignation ,  babar said . 
jamaat islami leader qazi hussain ahmed said the decision will have lasting impact on pakistans political scene . 
talking to reporters ,  qazi advised zardari to resign without waiting for the people to demand it . 
the controversial law abolished all cases of criminal ,  corruption ,  embezzlement and misuse of power against politicians and government officials registered from january <num>1</num>  , <num>1986</num>  to october <num>12</num>  , <num>1999</num>  .
the supreme court in a landmark decision july <num>31</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , asked the government to approve all ordinances pending in parliament ,  including the nro ,  which was up for renewal . 
however ,  on november <num>4</num>  , <num>2009</num>  , facing resistance from opposition parties ,  the government ,  withdrew the nro bill from the agenda of the national assembly . 
the government then decided not to defend the law before the court . 
zardari is not the only beneficiary of the law . 
the leader of the muthahida qaumi movement  ( mqm )  ,  altaf hussian ,  is reported to be the biggest beneficiary with <num>71</num>  cases ,  including murders and attempted murder ,  withdrawn against him . 
the mother-in-law of zardari ,  nusrat bhutto ,  ppp leader jehangir badr ,  interior minister rehman malik ,  and defense minister ahmad mukhtar also benefited from the law .

kazakhstan to assist kyrgyzstan in avoiding food crisis
topping the agenda for discussion was the situation in georgia ,  and the development of the countries bilateral cooperation . 
as their first order of business ,  the heads of these central asian countries discussed the situation on the ground in the georgia-russia zone . 
bakiyev and nazarbayev both welcomed the cessation of military operations in the areas of conflict between the georgians and south ossetians as well as the georgians and abkhazians . 
presidents of kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan in a joint appearance
the two presidents issued a statement saying the cessation of violence will enable humanitarian problems to be properly addressed ,  an issue of primary importance at this time . 
the two presidents issued a statement saying the cessation of violence will enable humanitarian problems to be properly addressed ,  an issue of primary importance at this time . 
assistance ,  in particular food aid ,  is sorely needed to help refugees and people who have lost their homes . 
we have seen on our television screens the total devastation of the city of tskhinvali . 
georgia seems to have sustained considerable damage as well . 
for ordinary people caught in the conflict ,  this is a humanitarian catastrophe . 
kurmanbek saliyevich and i would like to express our sincere condolences to the families of those killed in the conflict . 
according to information released by kazakhstans emergency situations ministry ,  the country is sending one military transport plane with humanitarian aid cargo to the russian city of vladikavkaz for delivery to south ossetia . 
at the same time ,  kazakhstan intends to provide what help it can to georgia . 
according to experts ,  georgia and kazakhstan are bound by strong economic ties-the most important of these being kazakhstans investment in georgias transportation infrastructure which provides an alternate delivery route to european markets . 
other countries issue the same statements ,  with caveats that they are for the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and against russia ,  or vice-versa . 
in other words ,  kazakhstan has favoured neither its ally  ( russia )  nor its partner  ( the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  )  ,  "  according to kuzmin . 
dosym satpayev ,  director of risk assessment group  ( kazakhstan ) 
at the same meeting ,  the two heads of state discussed issues around increasing bilateral ties and progress on implementing agreements reached during the second session of the high intergovernmental council of the two countries held last april . 
it was also pointed out that kazakhstan has adopted new rules for kyrgyz citizens entering the country . 
these visitors may stay in kazakhstan for <num>90</num>  days without registering with the authorities . 
 " we would like to increase our trade to a billion dollars ,  "  nazarbayev announced . 
 " kurmanbek bakiyev himself stated at a recent cabinet meeting the situation in the country is taking an alarming turn ,  "  the director of kazakhstan's risk assessment group ,  dosym satpayev said . 
according to the political analyst ,  the country's economic plight can have serious political repercussions for bakiyev . 
if the food supply issue is not resolved by the autumn of this year ,  the kyrgyz opposition will organise bread riots . 
 " in this light ,  kazakhstan's assistance might come at a very opportune moment ,  "  satpayev said . 
 " but in return ,  the kyrgyz president will be compelled to give the green light to any of nursultan nazarbayev's future initiatives on central asian integration .  "

mobile banking hits afghanistan
the foundation for international community assistance  ( finca international ) 
the ability to use mobile phones to send and receive money has become widely popular all over the world . 
from brazil and kenya ,  to the philippines ,  millions of people who live in areas where a bank is not easily accessible still enjoy the convenience of banking . 
with the popularity of mobile phones and bank accounts growing widely in afghanistan ,  the m-paisa programme has been launched to offer afghans access to mobile banking . 
a pilot project was launched in the spring through the mobile phone company roshan . 
the foundation for international community assistance  ( finca international )  ,  a microfinance agency working in afghanistan ,  has been one of the first to try out m-paisa by allowing its clients to receive and pay back their loans through mobile banking . 
so far ,  <num>1,800</num>  borrowers have begun using mobile banking . 
a major challenge to bring this programme to pakistan is making sure it is compliant with the legal and regulator framework in the market . 
in order to provide m-paisa services ,  the operator has to apply for a money service provider license and adhere to a massive set of anti-money laundering regulations and other policies which takes time . 
the first microfinance bank in afghanistan is also offering mobile banking services to its borrowers . 
according to mansur mehdi ,  an official from the bank ,  around seven percent of their borrowers have mobile telephones . 
mobile banking will save the client from having to travel to a branch and stand in lines for financial services . 
from our perspective ,  it will save the bank transaction costs if more clients use mobile banking . 
it keeps the bank from having to open as many branches and allows us to reach to more clients in rural areas ,  he said . 
if mobile banking becomes more widespread in afghanistan ,  mehdi said that interest rates and user fees could go down ,  and the operating costs of the bank would decrease . 
poor widows struggle to survive
nearly <num>100</num>  women gathered in the governors compound in asadabad in hopes of receiving government assistance before the start of ramadan next week . 
we are all widows ,  and some of us are very poor people . 
we are hoping the government will help us with something ,  said one widow . 
a member of the world food programme distributes cds to highlight the poor in remote areas across the world at the dubai international humanitarian aid and development conference and exhibition ,  april <num>8</num>  .

the united arab emirates sent hundreds of cartons of dates to the afghan government - as it does every year for many poorer muslim countries - in anticipation of ramadan . 
dates are traditionally eaten to break the daily fast during the muslim holy month . 
but this day showed the challenges of governance in a country where capacity is low and the officials themselves are learning how to deliver services to the population . 
the women waited nearly two hours before the distribution began ,  huddled in their all-encompassing burqas on the walkway outside the governors office . 
asadabad has an unusually high number of widows after <num>30</num>  years of conflict ,  including the kerala massacre of <num>1979</num>  in which an estimated <num>1,200</num>  people were killed by pro-communist government forces . 
a mass grave in the city marks the place of their deaths . 
and in this ultra-conservative pashtun society ,  women generally cannot work outside the home . 
widows must be cared for either by the government or by sympathetic relatives . 
but in a country where the government is struggling to provide basic services ,  many of the most needy fall through the cracks . 
we havent received any help from the government before . 
on mothers day there was a lot of humanitarian assistance given to the womens affairs department ,  but we didnt get anything ,  sharifa said . 
the other women nodded their heads and ten or twelve voices arose . 
shakila spoke the loudest ,  from behind the grill of her blue burqa . 
were all poor widows ,  she began . 
the government and foreign organisations should help us . 
we have no way to work for money . 
the government does provide some services to widows such as free health care in asadabads clinics . 
education is also free ,  and the womens children go to school . 
we make our sons go to school to learn something . 
when they finish school they go to the bazaar and do some work ,  shakila said . 
zia gul safi is responsible for human rights at the department of womens affairs . 
all of these ladies are poor widows ,  so i called early in the morning to them ,  and told their sons ,  your mothers should come here today and the government will give something to you ,  she said . 
they make us come all the way down here and wait for this ,  one woman muttered bitterly as she walked out with her son . 
this will not even be enough for one day . 
the <num>17</num>  cartons the government distributed to the widows seemed paltry indeed compared to the hundreds of cartons stacked up within sight that officials said were meant for police officers and orphans . 
how can such women take care of themselves ? 
we trust in god that he will provide something so we can feed ourselves ,  said sharifa . 
an exhibition of the best uzbek goods produced will be held in tashkent
the ministry press service reports that this year the exhibition will be a more heavyweight affair than previously . 
the latest developments ,  new products whose quality meets international standards and that enjoy steady demand in foreign markets ,  will be represented . 
the exhibits will be represent the economic output of uzbekistan ,  from the manufacturing of cars and aircraft ,  agricultural equipment ,  industrial and domestic electronics ,  and telecommunications services ,  to agricultural products and consumer goods ,  the report states . 
evidently a special place at the exhibition will be occupied by output from the uzbek car industry . 
the organisers of the exhibition are promising that the entire range of smaller vehicles produced by the gm uzbekistan joint enterprise will be available ,  and it will be possible not only to see them ,  but also to test them . 
daewoo cars assembled in uzbekistan have for more than ten years been a unique kind of calling card of this country for consumers in russia and the cis countries . 
in <num>1992</num>  daewoo motor and the uzbek state company uzavtosanoat created ,  on a parity basis ,  the uzdaewooauto joint enterprise to assemble smaller vehicles in the town of asaka in andizhan district . 
in <num>2005</num>  , uzdaewooauto purchased a share of the korean company ,  which ,  as is known ,  went bankrupt . 
according to media reports ,  the cost of the buyout was <num>110</num>  $  million . 
in an agreement between general motors and the government of uzbekistan signed in october <num>2007</num>  , mention is made of the possibility of increasing general motors share <num>40</num>  %  to <num>51.6</num>  billion som . 
according to figures from uzbekistans state committee for statistics ,  during the period january-june <num>2008</num>  gm uzbekistan produced <num>90,168</num>  vehicles ,  which is <num>8.8</num>  %  more than for the corresponding period in <num>2007</num>  .
this figure includes <num>44,958</num>  nexia cars  ( an increase of <num>9</num>  %  )  ,  <num>32,452</num>  matiz cars  ( an increase of <num>7.4</num>  %  )  ,  <num>11,050</num>  damas cars  ( <num>13.9</num>  %  more )  ,  <num>847</num>  captivas ,  <num>851</num>  epica cars ,  and <num>10</num>  tacuma . 
in <num>2007</num>  , gm uzbekistan produced <num>171,809</num>  vehicles . 
uzbekistan moving towards closer relations ,  including increased military ties with <abbr>u.s.</abbr>

uzbekistans political elite is once again laying the groundwork for improving relations with the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and other western nations . 
any possibility of regime change in the region will be blocked by both west and east ,  since a destabilisation in these countries could lead to the islamisation of the entire region . 
experts believe that central asian military forces are deficient in their preparedness . 
these issues were addressed in an exclusive interview with respected russian military observer and correspondent of novaya gazeta ,  pavel felgenhauer . 
for current military purposes ,  nato has bagram and other bases within afghanistans borders . 
but the base has been important as a terminal for shipping operations ,  since military transport planes can make safe landings on its airfields . 
unlike bagram ,  which may still come under insurgent attack from time to time ,  this base is not subject to any threat of attack . 
the military base in kyrgyzstan is not terribly convenient for such purposes ,  being somewhat out of the way in relation to the theatre of operations . 
so its quite conceivable that american military commanders could be interested in the base ,  particularly because their relations with pakistan have become strained as of late . 
after karshi-khanabads closing ,  supplies for the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  as well as its allies ,  had to be sent through pakistan . 
 " currently ,  not a single player who exerts influence in central asia is interested in any sort of destabilisation . 
real destabilisation could occur only if extremists were able to stage an insurrection that was not quickly suppressed . 
and should one of the regimes show signs of weakness ,  something akin to a revolution might be fomented ,  possibly exhibiting strains of radical islam . 
long-established anti-islamic regimes are fertile soil for islamic revolutionaries . 
it's crystal clear to everyone that the current central asian leadership is better than any of the available alternatives . 
the most serious threat to central asia's stability today is not armed conflict between the region's countries ,  but their internal problems-though internal strife could still be fomented ,  of course ,  by way of some sort of territorial conflict .  " 
provincial officials throughout the country have begun meeting with kuchi elders to discuss the needs of their community . 
kuchis are pashtun nomadic tribes that have lived in afghanistan for <num>3,000</num>  years . 
the afghan government has pledged to help kuchis preserve their traditional way of life . 
but as the countrys population continues to grow ,  kuchi groups have begun to face many challenges . 
for example ,  it is becoming difficult to find open pasture areas to graze livestock . 
increasingly ,  many kuchi groups are finding that land on which they were once able to roam openly is now occupied by new landowners . 
conflict has arisen when kuchis are asked to pay a fee for each of their animals crossing occupied land . 
kuchis are suffering economically because of droughts in the northern areas of afghanistan and cannot afford to pay such fees . 
as a result of their economic hardships ,  tensions among kuchi and hazara communities have become widespread . 
last month ,  thousands of hazaras protested in kabul claiming the kuchi nomads had killed members of their community in wardak province . 
tensions have been rising over the course of the summer months especially as kuchis bring their livestock to the central provinces for grazing . 
many hazara communities who live in these areas have not been happy with the kuchi presence . 
at a meeting in maimana ,  faryabs provincial capital ,  hajji abdul hamid who represents kuchi tribes in the dawlatabad district said ,  we need the government to help us solve our basic problems such as health ,  security and poverty . 
in order for kuchis to continue their traditional way of life ,  we need government to help us . 
mohammad dawud niyazi ,  a government official representing faryab province said that programmes are underway to help the kuchi community . 
the government is building schools with dormitory facilities for kuchis to help solve their education problem . 
we are also constructing <num>18</num>  clinics nationwide in areas where large kuchi communities travel . 
we have also created <num>12</num>  mobile clinics that will travel around to areas of the country through which kuchi communities often pass ,  he said . 
one of the major topics of discussion was the government distributing land to kuchis and offering them security and protection . 
mohammad hashim zaher ,  who works as an advisor to president hamid karzai on the kuchi community ,  said ,  the government is paying the utmost attention to the rights and obligations of all people when distributing land . 
kyrgyz politicians wonder how to treat russias recognition of the independence of georgias insurgent provinces . 
the news agency <num>24</num>  .
kg has reported ,  citing the parliamentary committees chairman ,  erik arsaliev ,  that the kyrgyz parliaments committee for foreign affairs and inter-parliamentary cooperation  ( the zhogorku kenesh )  is to discuss russian recognition of abkhazias and south ossetias independence . 
kyrgyzstan is not georgia . 
and this place is not going to become yet another tension point between russia and nato . 
the conditions in kyrgyzstan are very different from those in the caucasus . 
in this region the only possible rows are over water and electricity . 
but this is a permanent state of affairs in central asia and the countries here have learned how to extricate themselves from such situations . 
they have very different goals and functions and there is nowhere they coincide . 
the <num>24</num>  .
kg news agency reported alikbek jekshenkulov ,  former minister of foreign affairs and current head of the international development and politics agency ,  as saying ,  in our region there is yet another major player ,  and that is china . 
it would not remain indifferent to any rising tensions in central asia . 
and since american interests here are represented in the form of the manas base ,  the issue of its future could become a stumbling block in the battle for influence in central asia ,  not just between russia and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  but also between shangai cooperation organisation members and nato . 
for this reason ,  the situation throughout central asia will depend on the degree to which kyrgyzstans leadership conducts a balanced foreign policy and defends the national interests . 
it is very important not to make a mistake . 
we are primarily interested in the material and financial aspects of the matter ,  particularly considering that a new lease agreement is due to be signed shortly ,  kazakbaev said . 
so no single country ,  be it russia or a member of the collective security treaty organisation ,  should put pressure on us . 
kazakbaev concluded :  kyrgyzstan is oriented further towards the west than other central asian states ,  whereas kazakhstan and uzbekistan basically cooperate with russia . 
in this context ,  the reaction of tajikistan ,  which is drawing closer to iran ,  another farsi-speaking country ,  could cause a surprise . 
presidents of kazakhstan and russia discuss cooperation in dushanbe
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev and his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev . 
 ( afp / getty images ) 
according to the press service of the president of kazakhstan ,  the leaders of both countries expressed satisfaction with the pace and progress of efforts to strengthen bilateral relations and to boost trade and economic cooperation in particular . 
nazarbayev invited medvedev to attend the kazakh-russian forum on border territories to be held in aktobe in september <num>2008</num>  .
reuters has analysed the stances of the member states of the shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  with regard to russias recognition of the independence of the separatist republics . 
the member states of the sco also made reference to the principle of territorial integrity in their declaration . 
those who attended the meeting in dushanbe underline the need to respect the historical and cultural traditions of all nations and peoples and efforts to preserve the unity of states and their territorial integrity in accordance with international law ,  the declaration stated . 
the heads of state of kazakhstan and belarus ,  which are also members of the commonwealth of independent states  ( cis )  and the collective security treaty organisation  ( csto )  ,  have merely declared their support for russian peace-keeping efforts . 
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said during his meeting with medvedev in dushanbe that he was sympathetic to moscows efforts to restore peace and hoped that the international community will follow the path of peace and understanding and not keep talking incessantly about a cold war . 
acting on advice from the russian ambassador in minsk to support the recognition of south ossetian and abkhazian independence ,  belarus premier aleksandr lukashenko sent medvedev a letter suggesting that the issue of the independence of the two caucasian regions be settled jointly with other csto members at the <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
therefore ,  according to reuters ,  russia remains the only country in the world to have officially recognised abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states . 
the west has insisted that the principle of territorial integrity of states be observed and has called on russian president dmitry medvedev to revoke his decree regarding the recognition of the independence of the breakaway republics and work towards reaching a consensus on how to resolve the conflict peacefully ,  including by means of the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory . 
gunfight in ashgabat
the turkmenistan chronicle asked why ,  if the terrorists had been killed ,  was it necessary to display their photographs in the capital and even in the regions . 
the lack of reliable and complete official information in relation to the events has led to the country becoming rife with rumour and speculation . 
international forces give food to needy for ramadan
international forces distributed food to afghans in manogai district today for ramadan . 
international forces operating in kunar typically give food aid to communities throughout the province as a symbol of goodwill . 
foodstuffs like beans ,  cooking oil ,  flour ,  green tea ,  and other necessities were distributed in our area ,  said manogai district governor mohammad rahman danish . 
prices for basics such as rice and oil skyrocket every year during ramadan ,  and ordinary people struggle to put food on the table . 
people in this poor province are already hard pressed to provide for their basic needs . 
according to a central statistics office study ,  <num>43</num>  percent of kunar households took out loans last year ,  mostly to buy food . 
we have a lot of needy people in our area ,  said ghulab shah ,  a nangalam resident . 
so this aid distribution is very important to those people .

the provincial reconstruction team  ( prt )  distributes humanitarian aid year-round in kunar ,  usually via the afghan red crescent society  ( arcs )  . 
but ramadan calls for more concentrated efforts . 
last year it took nearly the entire ramadan month to complete the distributions ,  according to prt officials .

fighting in pakistans bajaur agency last month uprooted thousands of families from that area ,  who subsequently fled to kunars border districts . 
they are still being housed and fed there ,  and the afghan government and the prt are helping those refugees as well as afghans . 
the tantil valley ,  just east of nangalam ,  is a frequent site of ied  ( improvised explosive device )  attacks . 
but residents there were very appreciative of the help they received from the international forces . 
we thank the coalition forces very sincerely for this help ,  said tantil valley resident rahman gul . 
we know they are working for the security of our country ,  and helping us with food as well . 
global financial crisis grips kazakhstan
between january and august <num>2008</num>  the profits of kazakhstans commercial banks were <num>46.5</num>  percent lower than over the same period in <num>2007</num>  .
since the beginning of this year the number of bad loans has risen twofold ,  and the percentage of seriously overdue loans doubled in just one month . 
the fact that these debts amounted to <num>8.2</num>  $  billion in july gives a clear picture of the scale of the problem now facing the financial sector . 
in addition ,  kazakh banks must repay <num>12</num>  $  billion of external loans by september <num>1</num>  , <num>2009</num>  .
these difficulties could have been written off as temporary setbacks were it not for the current shape of the overall situation on global financial markets . 
three kazakh banks and a number of state companies are listed on the london stock exchange . 
this week <num>24</num>  percent was wiped off the value of kazkom shares ,  while shares in the national bank fell by <num>13</num>  percent and those in alliance bank tumbled by over <num>60</num>  percent . 
shares in kazakhmys are falling on an almost daily basis ,  while kazmunaigaz shares have lost <num>5</num>  percent of their value . 
leaving aside kazakh companies dealing in mineral resources ,  this means that kazakh banks alone have lost almost <num>90</num>  percent of their value since being floated on the london exchange . 
needless to say ,  over the next few months they simply may not have the share capital they need - and then along will come the state ,  which is already trying very hard to sink its capital into banks . 
there is already talk of the state purchasing bad loans ,  which currently hang like a millstone around banks necks . 
however ,  it is not only debts and falling share prices which banks have to contend with . 
those in charge of the regulatory body believe that this will raise the quality of the financial sectors assets . 
those banks that lack the necessary funds will have to increase the size of their capital or merge . 
at least three of kazakhstans <num>35</num>  banks fall short of the new capital requirement . 
tribal leaders in pakistan crack down on taliban presence
pakistani tribal elders gather to attend a jirga in the mohmand agency ,  a town bordering afghanistan . 
 ( photo by str / afp / getty images ) 
pakistani tribal leaders from the bajuar agency held a grand jirga announcing that tougher sanctions must be placed on supporters of the taliban . 
bajuar agency is believed to be a militant stronghold where top taliban and al-qaeda officials are hiding . 
for any tribesman willing to provide refuge to the militants ,  tribal elders have called for the torching of their homes and a fine of one million rupees . 
this is the first time that local elders have come together to take drastic measures against those supporting militants in the area . 
elders from the salarzai tribes decided to hold a jirga after becoming fed up with taliban disruptions that continue to keep people from being able to live in peace and carry on with their day to day lives . 
locals are often forced to flee their homes due to heavy fighting and unannounced curfews have created many problems . 
most business centres and government departments have been forced to shut down in these areas . 
meanwhile ,  pashtun tribal elders living near the khyber pass have pledged to ensure that supplies travelling to afghanistan will be secured . 
since june <num>2008</num>  , over <num>20</num>  lorries hauling containers and dozens of oil-tankers have been attacked with their drivers being killed or kidnapped . 
a senior government official in the khyber pass region ,  tahab khan ,  confirmed the elders had signed an agreement with authorities to ensure the safety of supplies . 
the elders have pledged not only the safety of supply vehicles ,  but also to work together against militant groups that are aiming to attack them . 
the khyber pass is one of two main land routes going to afghanistan from pakistan and its main port of karachi . 
the other border crossing is chaman which lies in south-western pakistan . 
taliban attacks have continued to disrupt the day to day lives of pakistanis in the tribal areas . 
roads ,  business centres and trade routes have been shut down in many areas and tribal leaders are fed up with the taliban presence . 
thousands of tribesmen have come together forming private armies to take on local taliban in their area . 
in the tribal agency bajaur ,  over <num>200,000</num>  people have been displaced because of fighting . 
according to a july <num>26</num>  , <num>2007</num>  , presidential resolution ,  this years plan was to ensure a harvested crop of <num>1,600</num>  thousand tons of wheat through sowing <num>880</num>  thousand hectares of agricultural land for the <num>2008</num>  crop . 
while ashgabat remains well-supplied and relatively calm ,  in regional capitals and rural areas the bread crisis is gathering steam and causing widespread anxiety about the future . 
in turkmenabat and dashoguz ,  the only way to buy bread is to snap it up the moment it hits the shelves . 
the feverish buying lasts for <num>15</num>  to <num>20</num>  minutes ,  after which the <num>1,000</num>  manat  ( <num>7</num>  cents  [ usd ]  )  loaves of black bread are gone and after a half hour ,  even the lavash which is sold for <num>2,500</num>  manat  ( <num>17</num>  cents )  is only a memory . 
the frenzy is not confined to food stores . 
at bazaars in turkmenabat ,  mary and dashoguz ,  the <num>50</num> -kg bags of flour produced and sold by local millers are no longer available . 
even grain itself has become more expensive . 
a month ago ,  bazaars in koneurgenc and akdepe districts were selling a kilogram of wheat for <num>2500</num> -<num>3000</num>  manat . 
today ,  the worst grain sort ,  looking more like fodder than food ,  is snatched up for the princely sum of <num>5000</num> -<num>5200</num>  manat . 
the central asian state of turkmenistan has adopted a new constitution that supporters say will promote multi-party politics and the market economy . 
the measure was passed unanimously by the people's council ,  a group of <num>2,500</num>  tribal elders and local lawmakers . 
the council will be abolished and parliament will almost double in size after elections in december . 
the constitution comes two years after the death of autocratic leader saparmurat niyazov ,  whose tight grip on power resulted in two decades of almost complete isolation . 
foreign media criticised him as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive dictators who imposed his personal eccentricities upon the country-including renaming months after members of his family . 
exiles and observers ,  however ,  said the measures were superficial ,  leaving berdymukhamedov free to rule by decree .

kazakhstan ,  foreign investors seal huge oil fields deal
almaty-kazakhstan has finalised a deal on the major kashagan field in the caspian sea ,  ending uncertainty around the launch of oil production there . 
the new deal marked the end of a dispute between kazakhstan and foreign investors over possible delays in the launch of oil production and cost overruns .

eni ,  exxonmobil ,  total and shell each now hold a <num>16.81</num>  percent stake in the project ,  conocophillips holds <num>8.4</num>  percent and inpex holds <num>7.56</num>  percent .

amendments to tajik electoral legislation discussed
dushanbe - a meeting in dushanbe at the end of november ,  held within the framework of a project led by the international foundation for electoral systems  ( ifes )  ,  considered the issue of professional assistance for the conduct and reform of elections in tajikistan . 
according to deputy president of the social democratic party of tajikistan shokirjon hakimov the election legislation working group that held the meeting proposed that parliament consider adding three new articles to the law governing the election of deputies to local majlises  ( local elected authorities )  . 
members of the working group include representatives of the national parliament ,  the presidents department ,  the community council ,  the central committee for elections and referenda ,  all eight of the countrys official political parties and international experts . 
according to communist party member subhon safialoyev ,  amendments are necessary because <num>90</num>  percent of tajik voters do not know who the deputies are that represent them . 
he suggested that ,  deputies should provide voters with quarterly reports on their work ,  to familiarise their constituents with the extent to which they are responding to their needs . 
we hope that the government will be amenable to the idea of amending the law on elections in view of its obligations to the international community and its bearing on efforts to attract investment in the national economy and recruit new leadership for tajikistans political system ,  hakimov said .

nato targets drug smuggling bazaar
a special operations marine examines a poppy plant handed to him by an afghan national army soldier  ( right )  in afghanistans helmand province during a patrol through a village in which they were looking for taliban fighters . 
its suspected that many taliban smugglers are trading drugs for guns at a dedicated bazaar on the old afghan-soviet border . 
smugglers in northern afghanistan have said that they take heroin into tajikistan ,  where they swap it for guns ,  ammunition and sex . 
criminal insiders say that russian gangsters ,  who smuggle the drugs into europe ,  buy the heroin from them using kalashnikovs instead of cash ,  while prostitutes sell themselves for scraps of surplus heroin . 
nato estimates that the taliban receives up to <num>40</num>  percent of its income from drugs ,  but details of the bazaar suggest that the economy has evolved well beyond simple cash transactions ,  and that the real figure could be far higher . 
the weapons on sale include machine guns ,  sniper rifles and anti-aircraft weapons such as the ones used in the assassination attempt on president hamid karzai in april <num>2008</num>  .
the guns ,  from all over the former soviet union ,  are broken down into parts ,  smuggled back into afghanistan and delivered to the taliban front lines . 
one kilogram of heroin can buy around <num>30</num>  ak-47 assault rifles at the bazaar ,  or <num>7,000</num>  bullets . 
the smugglers say that around <num>100</num>  kilogram  crosses the border every day . 
their revelations come as afghanistans other neighbours ,  iran and pakistan ,  have both agreed to cooperate with afghan border officials to try and crack down on smuggling . 
the men - who asked not to be named ,  for fear of reprisals rather than the law - described a bleak village with no homes ,  hidden in tajikistans desert ;  a collection of mud compounds ,  covering no more than four acres ,  that exists purely to trade heroin for guns . 
inside the square ,  in open-air courtyards ,  up to <num>300</num>  shopkeepers sit cross-legged on carpets in small booths that hug the compound walls . 
they act as agents for the russian mafia who supply the guns and spirit the drugs away . 
we interviewed three smugglers in the lawless border areas north and east of kunduz ,  a city in northern afghanistan ,  as well as a taliban go-between who was visiting from helmand . 
they said that afghan smugglers ,  often impoverished farmers ,  carry sacks of high-quality heroin across the oxus ,  the ancient river that marks afghanistans northern border ,  into the wastelands of southern tajikistan . 
then they use inflatable boats to cross the river ,  which they hide on the other side . 
we leave early in the evening and we get there at around <num>9</num>  <abbr>a.m.</abbr>  the next day ,  one said . 
there arent even any tracks because we never ride the motorbikes to the same place twice . 
the poppy is harvested from opium farms across afghanistan and taken to factories hidden in the remote pamir mountains in badakhshan ,  where it is turned into heroin . 
from badakhshan it is brought west to kunduz ,  for the trip north to tajikistan . 
the weapons follow similar routes ,  but in the opposite direction ,  south and east towards the fighting . 
 " we are like a company ,  "  daoud said . 
 " we have some big sponsors who support us in the government . 
some people are employed to collect the opium from the farmers and from the villages and other people are employed to transport it to the factories .  " 
a kilogram of the best afghan heroin ,  known as dana da or batan ,  is worth <num>600</num>  £   [ gbp ]  in afghanistan . 
it is worth twice as much at the smugglers' bazaar in tajikistan ,  but rather than take cash ,  they take the broken down parts of kalashnikovs ,  bullets and rocket-propelled grenades instead ,  because they double their value in afghanistan . 
a smuggler who buys 1kg of heroin for <num>600</num>  £  in afghanistan can swap it for up to <num>30</num>  guns in tajikistan . 
these are then worth <num>3,000</num>  £  when brought back across the border ,  where the taliban are eagerly waiting to snap them up . 
the massive mark-up is more than enough to cover the <num>100</num>  £  cost of hiring a farmer each way to take the risks of carrying the contraband . 
violence last year reached record highs ,  and the taliban have already launched two attacks in kabul since the new year . 
 " the heroin is what lets us fight ,  "  said one taliban go-between . 
a tragedy not to be repeated
to implement the health plan ,  <num>40,000</num>  laboratory test systems for passive testing of children up to five years of age and <num>4,000</num>  subclavian catheters were purchased ,  which ,  according to the kyrgyzstan ministry of health information should be enough for two years . 
in addition ,  the plan provides for the training of specialists in infection control methods and <num>380</num>  doctors have now been trained in the republic's infection control center .

his comments seemed to avoid directly criticising the president of pakistan ,  asif ali zardari ,  and his democratically elected government . 
indian citizens and police officials alike have expressed concern about follow-on attacks by terrorists who might have escaped during the mayhem of the assault .

uzbekistan and tajikistan sign gas supply agreement
tajikistan is not producing and importing enough natural gas to cover demand . 
dushanbe - tajikistan will buy about <num>550</num>  million cubic metres of natural gas from neighbouring uzbekistan this year for us$240 per <num>1,000</num>  cubic metres ,  announced fatkhiddin mukhsiddinov ,  the director of the state unitary enterprise tajikgaz .

in particular ,  tashkent refused to hold an independent inquiry on the andijan events of <num>2005</num>  and did not respond to calls to release political prisoners and persons suspected of spreading anti-government religious propaganda .

hope for child drug addicts in afghanistan
soaman is like any other four-year-old - except that she used to be a heroin addict . 
in a poor country ,  najia is the poorest of the poor . 
she lives with her husband and daughter in kabul's old city ,  an area of winding dirt lanes ,  tumbling mud huts and drug addicts who openly smoke their goods . 
to pay for their addictions ,  najia and her husband sold their furniture ,  their carpets and even their clothes ,  leaving them destitute . 
afghanistan has long been the largest heroin-producing nation ,  responsible for <num>90</num>  per cent of the world's supply . 
the abundance of the drug has led to a sharp increase in the number of afghans using it . 
the nejat centre ,  which treats child and female drug addicts in the old city ,  has more than <num>900</num>  women and <num>110</num>  children on its books .

the two countries also have <num>116</num>  other operative bilateral agreements between them . 
uzbekistan is now relying heavily on bilateral cooperation with its neighbours . 
tashkent decided in november <num>2008</num>  to suspend its membership in the eurasian economic community because its members ,  belarus ,  kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  russia and tajikistan as members and moldova ,  ukraine and armenia as observers ,  did not adequately take uzbek interests into account in its decisions .

medical waste previously was buried by hospital workers in special landfills or burned in metal barrels ,  which did not totally eliminate the risk of infection . 
the new facility ,  however ,  is ecologically safe . 
the equipment releases steam into the air rather than particle-bearing smoke . 
it was purchased from france at a cost of about us$200 , 000
particles of material in gases generated in the inner chamber are completely destroyed by a water filter that captures them ,  engineer maksim dudka said .

kazakh government to offer tax breaks to mineral extraction companies
the new tax was based on an oil price of <num>60</num>  $  , while the price has fallen to <num>40</num>  $  .
the government may reduce tax rate for companies developing minimally profitable deposits on the condition that they not cut jobs or funding for investment programmes . 
according to kazakh finance minister bolat zhamishev these companies may receive breaks totalling about us$200 million . 
the met rate is based on the value of the amount of mineral resources extracted and the profitability and productivity of the deposit . 
the possibility of reducing the tax burden for mineral extraction companies was first mentioned last december by kazakh minister of energy and natural resources sauat mynbaev who made the suggestion in light of the sharp drop in world oil prices . 
the government is expected to reduce the met this month . 
tax rates for companies extracting oil and gas condensate range from five percent for companies producing less than <num>250,000</num>  tonnes of oil per year to <num>18</num>  percent for companies producing more than <num>10</num>  million tonnes .

uzbekistan and turkmenistan are the only two countries in the world that indicate nationality in their passports . 
the un convention to eliminate discrimination based on nationality ,  which kazakhstan signed ,  opposes the indication of nationality in passports .

at present ,  only specialists and scholars are able to examine gold coins from the samanid era . 
tajikistan - the tajik khudzhanda historical museum is preparing to display items that have never been shown to the public before ,  including coins from the samanid era . 
the museums head curator kimiekhon atoyeva said items in the museums collection dating as far back as the ninth and tenth centuries will be included in the display . 
she said these valuable rarities were not previously exhibited because the museum lacked a modern security system . 
the exhibit will open to the public next summer if the remodelling is completed on time . 
the museum currently displays <num>1,500</num>  exhibit items with <num>15,000</num>  more held in store rooms .

rakhmon and medvedev talks to be continued
in moscow ,  rakhmon met with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev . 
the presidents discussed bilateral economic cooperation ,  especially the construction of the rogun hydroelectric station and other hydroelectric facilities . 
at the end of talks ,  it was announced that the presidents would visit each other's countries in the near future . 
many experts connect the tajik president's initial unwillingness to fly to moscow with a statement medvedev made on <abbr>jan.</abbr> 
<num>23</num>  during a visit to tashkent in which he remarked that russia would participate in building hydroelectric complexes in the region only if all contiguous countries agreed . 
tajikistan and uzbekistan have a long-running disagreement on that matter . 
new highway to provide escape from a transportation dead end
the project includes the construction of three major bridges . 
 ( photo by gent shkullaku / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - the abu dhabi fund allocated us$15 million to tajikistan for construction of the kulyab-kalai-khumb highway . 
according to executive director of the ministry of transportation and communications centre for realisation of projects ismonkul shokulov the project was developed by the kuwaiti-lebanese company al abu hadi spectrum in <num>2008</num>  .
according to shokulov the project will be completed in <num>2011</num>  for the 20t anniversary of tajikistans independence . 
it includes the construction of three major bridges ,  each <num>1</num>  km in length . 
economist rasul anvarov asserts the project has important economic and political significance for tajikistan . 
first of all ,  it will allow tajikistan to eliminate a transportation dead end and open an automobile route that will connect the republic to china ,  kyrgyzstan ,  afghanistan and pakistan . 
due to anticipated increases in taxes from the transit of freight along that route ,  economists believe the highway will have paid for itself several years after it opens .

baghdad-candidates endorsed by anti-u . s .  cleric muqtada al-sadr will appeal the results of last weekend's election in baghdad and other iraqi provinces because of alleged voting irregularities ,  a spokesman said <abbr>feb.</abbr>  <num>7</num>  .
elsewhere ,  sadrist-backed candidates finished well behind al-maliki and the religious-backed supreme islamic iraqi council ,  which maintains ties to both iran and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> 
members of al-maliki's dawa party issued a statement heralding the generally peaceful elections and calling on all those elected to work together . 
 " we call for everyone to cooperate with each other to take responsibility for the running of their provinces "  ,  the statement said . 
al-sadr ,  who lives in iran ,  lost much of his clout last year when government forces routed his militia from strongholds in baghdad and basra . 
his movement did not field candidates under the sadrist banner but endorsed lists of nominal independents . 
in baghdad ,  al-sadr backed candidates were demanding the electoral commission identify those involved with manipulating election results . 
 " there are huge differences between results announced by the electoral commission and the figures we have from our observers in some provinces "  ,  said tahir al-kinani ,  a spokesman for one of the two candidate lists backed by al-sadr . 
al-kinani told reporters at a news conference that the candidates were appealing the results in the provinces of baghdad ,  najaf ,  maysan and qadisiyah . 
kazakhstan is trying to encourage energy saving and is develop alternative sources
president nursultan nazarbayev ,  kazakhstan  ( kazakh embassy photo ) 
kazakhstan should offer government support to companies that are concerned about saving energy ,  kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev believes . 
chairing the 19t meeting of the foreign investors council in the kazakh oil capital ,  atyrau ,  on june ,  nazarbayev said that enterprises that are running programmes to reduce energy intensity should be offered government backing ,  including financial support . 
nazarbayevs comments have been prompted by the acute power shortages faced by kazakhstan ,  despite being a major oil and gas producer . 
the energy-rich central asian country has reached the point where in order to ensure the sustainable development of its economy it must deal with this problem . 
kazakhstans power generation grew from 58 . 3billion kwh in <num>2002</num>  to 71 . 6billion kwh in <num>2007</num>  , while its gdp grew by about <num>58</num>  percent in real terms in this period . 
at the same time ,  net electricity exports totalled 110million kwh in <num>2000</num>  against net imports of 1million kwh in <num>2007</num>  .
that is why the only possibility of solving the problem in the short and medium term ,  i believe ,  is the encouragement of energy saving . 
another alternative is the development of renewable energy sources in kazakhstan . 
according to estimates ,  it is technically feasible for kazakhstan to produce over 330billion kwh of electricity from wind and 4billion kwh from solar energy per year . 
however ,  in order to implement such large-scale projects we need to create a favourable investment climate ,  the kazakh president admitted .

kazakhstan forecasts bumper grain harvest
almaty - while the international grains council has forecast a decline in the quantity of corn harvested by leading world producers including the eu ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  china ,  russia and ukraine ,  the kazakh ministry of agriculture expects a bumper crop this year . 
despite a severe drought in <num>2008</num>  kazakhstan harvested a total of <num>15.6</num>  million tonnes of grain dry weight ,  <num>6</num>  million tonnes of which were for export . 
the wheat harvest amounted to <num>12.5</num>  million tonnes . 
the ministry of agriculture has forecast that this years global wheat harvest will amount to <num>650</num>  million tonnes ,  down <num>37</num>  million tonnes from last years . 
experts believe there will be a lower yield owing to a one percent reduction in the total cultivated area as a result of lower grain prices and higher production costs . 
eu helps kazakhstan combat torture

director of freedom house europe vladimir shkolnikov said that the main outcomes of the project were the creation of a coalition of non-government organisations to combat torture ,  a system for the sharing of information on torture and a centralised database . 
he noted that media coverage of the project has lifted the taboo on discussing torture and also that partnerships between governments ,  international agencies and ngos to end the practice of torture were formed . 
experts say ,  however ,  that central asia has a long way to go before torture is stamped out . 
director of the kazakh international bureau for human rights and legal compliance evgenia zhovtisa said that the vulnerability of prisoners and irresponsibility of courts in dealing with cases of torture are still widespread problems in kazakhstan . 
there were <num>765</num>  cases of torture reported while the project was under way in the region ,  though they have yet to be proven by way of judicial proceedings . 
of these ,  <num>586</num>  were reported in kazakhstan ,  <num>92</num>  in tajikistan and <num>87</num>  in kyrgyzstan .

nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . 
mingora-nato has led a growing chorus of international concern by warning that a truce between the government of pakistan and taliban militants in a restive region near the afghan border risks giving the extremists a  " safe haven "  . 
as part of the deal ,  the pro-taliban cleric agreed to travel to swat and discuss peace with maulana fazlullah ,  his son-in-law and the leader of the swat taliban . 
muhammad and his convoy of <num>300</num>  vehicles arrived in swat's main city of mingora on <abbr>feb.</abbr>

dushanbe-lake sarez in the pamir mountains of tajikistan has existed for <num>98</num>  years following the great earthquake of <abbr>feb.</abbr> 
more than one hundred people died as a result of the tragedy . 
the researcher believes that the region is entering a cycle of tectonic activity ,  which increases the likelihood of a major earthquake and the possibility of the failure of the usoi dam . 
predicting the exact time of the catastrophe is impossible ,  notes khusravov . 
the generally accepted easing of the problem would be lowering the lakes level by siphoning water off through pipes built into the dam ,  he explains . 
but by lowering the water level ,  you increase the risk of landslide because there is an enormous cliff that has so far been held in place by the lakes waters . 
the consequences of lowering the water level are difficult to predict and might not be worth risking . 
in this light ,  khusravov believes that priority should be given instead to an early warning system to alert population centres downstream in case of a catastrophic failure of the dam .

ryvok marks the directing debut of the man behind the project ,  kanagat mustafin ,  who was himself a professional basketball player and knows the sport inside out .

the ombudsman has already created a working group to study amending laws that contradict democratic principles . 
he also said that he is developing a framework on the defense of human rights that should be completed by the end of this year . 
in addition ,  a strategy on defending human rights will be adopted that he believes will gain financial support from the un . 
the ombudsman said an agreement on it would be signed shortly . 
a rollback in freedom of speech was noted in the report <num>2008</num>  world press freedom review :  asia in focus ,  which was released in february by the international press institute . 
the report stressed that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are declining in kyrgyzstan . 
but recently ,  lawrence wright reported on a battle of words between sayyid imam al-sharif  ( a . k . a .  dr fadl )  ,  one of the most important theorists of violent islamism ,  and ayman al-zawahiri ,  osama bin ladens chief collaborator . 
the feud intensified in the autumn of <num>2007</num>  , when fadl ,  the author of a canonical encyclopedia of violent jihad ,  released a new work ,  rationalizing jihad in egypt and the world . 
writing from an egyptian prison cell ,  fadl denounced al-qaedas indiscriminate murder of innocents and lashed out at his former friend zawahiri . 
fadl was particularly incensed by edits that zawahiri had made to his encyclopedia without consulting him . 
i do not know anyone in the history of islam prior to ayman al-zawahiri who engaged in such lying ,  cheating ,  forgery ,  and betrayal of trust by transgressing against someone elses book ,  fadl raged . 
zawahiri responded to fadls accusations by publishing ,  on the internet ,  a new book of his own . 
this is embarrassing for imam ,  said kamal habib ,  a prominent former member of egyptian islamic jihad who had previously praised fadls attempts at reconsidering violence . 
i dont think he realizes what it does to his image .

if rtr-planet were to go off the airwaves ,  russia would lose its last megaphone in tajikistan . 
 ( photo by dmitry kostyukov / afp / getty images ) 
the debt has since been cleared ,  but because tajikistan's increased the charges for rebroadcasting ,  the signing of a new contract was delayed until the very last minute . 
since then ,  the price of electricity and other services has risen by factors of ten or more ,  and we could no longer rebroadcast the channel at these prices . 
the russian side was informed of this in a timely manner .  " 
according to teleradiokom's chief ,  rtr-planet will be restored to the airwaves after a new contract is signed .

nookat detainees allegedly tortured brutally
hijabs ,  beards ,  possession of forbidden literature ,  and unusual behaviour are the criteria by which bureaucrats identify members of hizb ut-tahrir .

according to abdirasulova ,  the detainees were tortured to make them sign denunciations of <num>20</num>  people who are allegedly members of the banned party hizb ut-tahrir . 
according to the commission chairperson ,  local authorities in osh region count entire families as religious extremists ,  including minors and the elderly . 
it is not known what criteria local authorities use to create these kinds of lists ,  the report said . 
as information received by the commission shows ,  members of local authorities have subjective opinions about criteria by which to assume membership . 
thirty-two residents of nookat were convicted and sentenced to terms of nine to <num>20</num>  years for organising mass riots at the regional administration building during the celebration of the orozo ait holiday last <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
at that event ,  a group of aggressive people threw stones at the administrative building and policemen there . 
trends in state policy in the field of national education in turkmenistan
it was precisely during that period that berdymukhamedov announced that education was one of the most important priorities in his own future activity in the post of president . 
his ideas for increasing the period of education ,  introducing computer technology into the teaching process ,  and providing broad access to the internet ,  earned him not a little sympathy among the voters . 
the low level of education was depriving the rising generation of particular qualities ,  which was something well-understood by the countrys population ,  and especially the young people . 
in parallel with this it was required that the task of bringing the entire school infrastructure ,  primarily the rural schools ,  should be resolved in the shortest possible time . 
the announced policy of computerisation in schools and the idea of broadly introducing interactive learning cannot be realised without resolving the question of general accessibility to the internet ,  and raising the level of communication with the net . 
only this will enable use of the internet as a full-value information resource . 
the national system of education also faces the task of overcoming the legacy of the recent past ,  when students and teachers were restricted . 
according to testimony from more than <num>20</num>  teachers in schools and colleges ,  it was prohibited from giving unsatisfactory marks during examinations and tests . 
in schools ,  teachers had to artificially raise the level of the overall results at the end of each academic year . 
the teachers and educators see the existing problems ,  and stand ready to propose practical solutions to the situation that has been created . 
according to a university reader at the state polytechnic institute ,  the authorities are not showing sufficient determination in carrying out the reforms . 
there is no doubt that the stagnation in the former system of education and the various bureaucratic impediments are still preventing the reform in education from reaching the desired level ,  the reader said . 
the new teaching plans in schools are not being matched with the teaching programmes in the universities and are failing to meet the needs of production or the requirements of the economy .

in <num>1985</num>  , however ,  nazarov relocated to the bolshoi where he trained for two years . 
the top theatres in russia then began inviting him to perform in their opera productions ,  the most famous of which was his performance at the maria bieshu international festival of opera and ballet in <num>1993</num>  .
there ,  his voice made such a deep impression on bieshu ,  a prodigiously talented opera singer in her own right ,  that she sent a praise filled telegram to turkmenistans culture minister at the time . 
the event cemented nazarovs prospects for earning the coveted title of peoples artist of turkmenistan .

<num>12</num>  , the dca told journalists that one of the participants in the incident ,  an afghan citizen ,  had been detained . 
investigative work to identify and detain the other members of the criminal gang is ongoing ,  the agencys press service said . 
the tajik authorities confrontations with drug dealers ,  who transport a large proportion of the opium and heroin manufactured in afghanistan through tajikistan ,  are growing harsher . 
smugglers are offering armed resistance more frequently and ,  as experience has shown ,  they are often better armed than tajik law and border enforcement . 
drug addiction on the rise in central asia according to un report
central asia's growing population of drug addicts is a direct result of increased supply of drugs originating in afghanistan and transiting through these countries . 
 ( photo by shah marai / afp / getty images ) 
according to the un's international narcotics control board  ( incb )  annual report ,  drug addiction in central asia is continuing on a steady upward trend . 
in <num>2008</num>  , uzbekistan registered <num>130,000</num>  drug addicts ,  kazakhstan <num>100,000</num>  , kyrgyzstan <num>26,000</num>  , and tajikistan <num>23,000</num>  .
turkmenistan's figures are not available because the country's government did not release them . 
the committee's annual report makes the case that the rising numbers of drug addicts in central asia is a direct result of increased supply of drugs originating in afghanistan and transiting through these countries to russia and europe . 
according to local media ,  last year <num>121</num>  tonnes of heroin and <num>300</num>  tonnes of opium were seized by anti-narcotics squads across the region . 
callahan did ,  however ,  emphasise the sobering trends in the region . 
in <num>2000</num>  , kazakhstan officially had <num>256</num>  drug addicts per <num>100,000</num>  people while neighbouring kyrgyzstan reported <num>91</num>  addicts per <num>100,000</num>  , tajikistan <num>68</num>  and uzbekistan <num>58</num>  .
today ,  these figures have climbed to <num>356</num>  , <num>157</num>  , <num>136</num>  and <num>72</num>  respectively . 
 " the biggest age group for drug addiction is <num>28</num> -<num>32</num>  .
opiate abuse in intravenous form varies from <num>100</num>  percent of the cases in kazakhstan to <num>68</num>  percent in tajikistan "  ,  noted callahan . 
each country in the region has its own strategy for combating drug use . 
tajikistan receives funds from international aid organisations to modernise border surveillance in an attempt to stave off the flow of narcotics from afghanistan . 
kyrgyzstan has placed more emphasis on drug education and prevention ,  inaugurating a programme last year designed to increase awareness among <num>13</num> -<num>22</num>  year olds of the negative effects of narcotics . 
kazakhstan's national security committee has been fighting the criminal groups involved in the drug trade . 
since <num>1999</num>  , it has identified <num>125</num>  organised crime syndicates ,  <num>30</num>  of which were directly involved in drug transport and smuggling . 
uzbekistan has focused on treatment .

kazakhstan - the government of kazakhstan has approved its <num>2009</num> -<num>2011</num>  strategic space plan detailing the priorities for kazkosmos ,  the national space agency and identifying the risks involved . 
the main priorities are to create special space systems and technologies ,  and to develop the baikonur facility and other equipment necessary to put spacecraft into orbit . 
emphasis is also to be placed on developing scientific and experimental operations and training staff . 
the government has allocated more than us$660 million for the three-year plan . 
to counter these risks ,  the strategic plan makes provision for efforts to create a domestic market for space services ,  and negotiate with russia on amending the baikonur rental agreement to allow kazakhstan and other countries to play a role in developing the facility . 
dushanbes only independent television channel taken off the air
options are declining for tv viewers in tajikistan as private broadcasters are taken off the air
tajikistan- independent tajik television  ( smt )  ,  the only independent television channel in the tajik capital dushanbe ,  suspended transmission on march <num>13</num>  .
observers immediately cited a trend in suspending broadcasts of private channels whose positions differs from official government policy . 
political analyst ravshan nizomov recalled that ,  on march <num>2</num>  , russian television channel rtr-planet was suspended because there was no contract for the new year . 
although the russian side subsequently accepted tajik teleradiocoms new terms and rates ,  there has been no rush to put rtr-planet back on the air . 
authorities close <num>21</num>  madrasas in kyrgyzstans chuy province

on march <num>16</num>  , deputy governor of kyrgyzstans chuy province natalya lyalenko announced before a provincial religious affairs committee that <num>21</num>  madrasas  ( islamic religious schools )  in the province have been closed . 
while authorities claim their decisions were based on violations of health and structural regulations in them ,  political observers link the closures to a campaign against religious fundamentalism being waged by the government as part of its new national security strategy . 
these violations were identified during inspections carried out jointly by local authorities ,  the ministry of education ,  the state religious affairs committee and law enforcement agencies . 
the procurators office closed madrasas on the basis of their findings ,  lyalenko said . 
head of the kyrgyz muslim spiritual authority murataly azhy zhumanov expressed his support for local authorities efforts to ensure that madrasas play by the rules and said that he favors provisions regarding the need for children to receive a secondary education . 
the supreme mufti also called on district chiefs in chuy province not to register mosques that refuse to accept the necessary documents issued by his organisation . 
all mosques now have to be registered with the muslim spiritual authority and the local authorities ,  he said . 
zhumanov acknowledged that the sharp rise in the number of new mosques built over the last <num>15</num>  years has had an adverse effect on the professional quality of staff associated with them . 
we have had to appoint as imams people who were barely capable of presiding over daily prayers . 
the situation is gradually improving ,  however ,  and we have already started to certify clerics . 
most local authority representatives say that literate clerics at local mosques can play an important role in combating the appeal of religious extremism . 
water in central asia is a regional security problem
participants in the 5th world water forum in istanbul . 
tajikistan president emomali rakhmon stands seventh from the left . 
 ( photo by reuters / osman orsal )  . 
according to rakhmon ,  over the last decade tajikistans glaciers ,  which are the main source of the regions rivers ,  have lost more than one-third of their volume while central asias population has greatly increased . 
the phenomenon of glacial melt off is growing steadily and in the near future may lead to a significant decrease in river runoff . 
he noted that if the intensive economic development of the regions countries is taken into account ,  which projects an increase of water consumption by at least <num>15</num> -<num>20</num>  percent by <num>2030</num>  , such a trend raises serious concerns . 
in the presidents opinion ,  another problem is in the unimproved system of irrigation . 
rakhmon emphasised that today in central asia up to <num>40</num>  percent of irrigation water is lost and not reclaimed ,  which has contributed significantly to the problem of insufficient water and energy that the region faces . 
one of the ways the president sees to preserve the regions water is to increase the reservoir capacity in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan ,  both countries of the upper reaches ,  which would contribute to more efficient utilisation of this natural resource across the region and an increase in the production of hydroelectric power . 
water resources are tajikistans principal wealth . 
with <num>65</num>  percent of central asias glaciers the country has the worlds third largest water volume . 
scientists assert ,  however ,  that in the last half century the ice sheets in the pamir ,  zerafshan and gissar mountains have receded by seven kilometres . 
because of climate warming ,  glacier size decreases annually during the summer months . 
if the trend of increasing temperatures in the region continues ,  there is the danger that by the end of this century some rivers will become significantly shallower or even dry up entirely because almost all of them are fed by glacier water . 
such a situation would have unfortunate consequences for central asian countries and possibly generate conflict in the region . 
members of public to serve as jurors in kyrgyzstan

during an initial period ,  jurors will only serve in bishkek and osh ,  but the system will be extended to other regions in <num>2013</num>  or <num>2014</num>  .
aliyeva said that because of financial constraints ,  jurors will return verdicts only on charges under six articles for which maximum sentences can be imposed . 
if the experiment is successful ,  the government will broaden the number of trials by jury . 
human rights organisations say that money is not the only important issue and that the success of the jury system will depend to a large extent on who is allowed to participate . 
the most important thing is to make sure that the idea of having juries doesnt turn into a farce ,  commented svetlana karymshakova ,  a human rights activist .

kyrgyzstan to reform water use
kyrgyzstan - this year ,  kyrgyzstan plans to form a new government body to deal exclusively with water issues . 
according to world bank institutional development expert kirill valentin ,  the new body will maintain a balance between the rights and interests of all categories of water users . 
currently ,  a number of governmental bodies and ministries handle water problems ,  and there is no consensus among them about how to handle their responsibilities . 
the world bank and asian bank recommend transferring responsibility for water supply systems to local authorities and eventually to rural community associations of drinking water users . 
bank experts believe that developing a sense of ownership among local authorities and the citizens themselves concerning the water they use will contribute to resolving water issues in the country . 
kyrgyz authorities support the initiative . 
kyrgyzstan ranks third among cis nations in water resources following russia and tajikistan . 
according to undp experts ,  kyrgyz ice and snow fields contain about <num>650</num>  cubic kilometres of ice . 
more than <num>30</num>  percent of the country's population ,  however ,  lacks access to drinking and bathing water . 
water has become a political issue in the central asian region . 
kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiev has called the increasing severity of water problems in central asia one of the external threats to the state .

soon after the start of the exercise ,  iran announced it had successfully test-fired a top secret missile ,  the third in a week . 
the report called the missile an ultra-horizon weapon and said it could be fired from all military helicopters and jet fighters . 
iran called it a turning point in missile tests but did not give any further details . 
 ( fox news ) 
a new surface-to-sea radar-avoiding missile ,  equipped with remote-control and searching systems ,  was tested on april <num>2</num>  state-run tv reported . 
it said the new missile ,  called kowsar ,  was a medium-range weapon that iran had the capability to mass-produce . 
it also asserted that the kowsars guidance system ,  which was designed to sink ships ,  could not be scrambled . 
on april <num>2</num>  , state tv also said the revolutionary guards had tested what it called a  " super-modern flying boat "  capable of evading radar . 
the report showed the boat ,  looking like an aircraft ,  taking off from the sea and flying low over the water . 
military analysts in moscow and the west said it appears the high-speed torpedoes were likely russian-built weapons that may have been acquired from china or kyrgyzstan . 
others have questioned their capabilities of evading advanced radar systems such as those in israel .

afghanistan remains world's largest opium producer

kabul-afghanistan remains the world's largest opium poppy producer despite efforts by western countries to stop cultivation in the war-torn country . 
from <num>2001</num>  to <num>2007</num>  , afghanistan's annual opium production continually increased to hit a record high of <num>7,200</num>  tons in <num>2007</num>  , according to a un report . 
in helmand province in southern afghanistan ,  the heartland of the taliban-led insurgency ,  the drug trade plays a vital role in fuelling the insurgency . 
the province accounts for two-thirds of all opium poppy production in afghanistan . 
the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  office on drugs and crime  ( unodc )  estimates the taliban earned us$100 million last year from the opium trade . 
eradication has been ineffective in reducing production but very costly in terms of human lives ,  a unodc report said . 
according to the <num>2008</num>  afghanistan opium survey conducted by unodc ,  the number of opium-free provinces rose from <num>13</num>  to <num>18</num>  owing to a sharp decrease in drug production in the northern provinces ,  where security is much better than the country's south . 
the un attributed the progress to good local governance and a drought which affected poppy growth in the north . 
an afghan interior ministry guard stands by a pile of seized drugs burning on the outskirts of kabul in august <num>2007</num>  .
currently ,  <num>98</num>  percent of afghanistan's opium cultivation takes place in just seven southern provinces ,  areas where the taliban insurgency is strongest . 
western officials in kabul said poppy growers and smugglers work with corrupt government officials and the taliban in the lucrative business ,  which makes up about <num>40</num>  percent of the country's economy . 
we want to re-examine it top to bottom ,  "  he said . 
last year in helmand ,  where some <num>8,000</num>  british soldiers are stationed ,  the british department for international development offered aid to local farmers in the form of wheat seeds ,  fertilizers and expert advice to persuade them to turn away from opium poppy cultivation .

iran supports kazakh proposal to host nuclear fuel bank
president ahmadinejad and kazakh counterpart nursultan nazarbayev review an honour guard during his visit to astana april <num>6</num>  .
almaty-during an april <num>6</num>  and <num>7</num>  visit to astana ,  president of iran mahmoud ahmadinejad said that his country supports kazakh president nursultan nazarbayevs proposal that an international nuclear fuel bank be created in kazakhstan . 
the kazakh president announced his proposal at a joint press conference with ahmadinejad on april <num>6</num>  .
if a nuclear fuel bank is set up for nuclear energy purposes ,  kazakhstan is prepared to consider the possibility of its being built here ,  since this country has signed a nuclear non-proliferation agreement and has voluntarily refrained from acquiring nuclear weapons ,  he stated . 
it was the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  that initially proposed the idea of creating bank in which states could store their nuclear fuel under the supervision of the international atomic energy agency . 
several other countries have already contributed funds for this purpose . 
during ahmadinejads visit ,  iraq and kazakhstan also reached agreement on construction of the uzen-gyzylgaya-bereket-etrek-gorgan railway along the east coast of the caspian sea to link kazakhstan with iran via turkmenistan ;  transportation of kazakh grain and oil to international markets via iran ;  and bilateral cooperation in the energy ,  petrochemical ,  agriculture ,  transport ,  tourism ,  sport ,  health and mass media sectors . 
in addition ,  the presidents agreed to propose a ten-year moratorium on sturgeon fishing in the caspian sea to prevent stocks from being exhausted . 
cooperation between the two countries has grown rapidly in recent years . 
kazakhstan now supplies around two million tonnes of oil a year to northern iran via the caspian sea ,  which it swaps for the same volume in the persian gulf . 
the value of bilateral trade now exceeds us$2 billion a year .

kyrgyzstan - at a meeting of experts working on a national food plan for kyrgyzstan ,  the world bank announced a decision to provide the country us$10 million by <num>2010</num>  for healthcare system reform . 
the money will be used to lower the deaths of mothers during childbirth and infant mortality . 
according to a unicef study ,  the state of the worlds children <num>2008</num>  , kyrgyzstan is in the top five in terms of infant mortality rates in the cis . 
alliance of womens legislative initiatives coordinator mira karybayeva said mother and infant mortality is an indicator of the state of development of a society . 
this isnt just a medical problem ;  families ,  society and the state must help solve it . 
mother and infant mortality is the product of a lack of information available to women and their family members about pregnancy and the postpartum period ,  low incomes ,  and poor quality services ,  she said .

afghan women lead street protest despite insults and stones
kabul - a new generation of young activists are defying clerics . 
it was the first time in the history of afghanistan that women were aware of their rights ,  she said . 
it was a fantastic statement that women will demand equal rights . 
on april <num>14</num>  , one of afghanistans most powerful shia clerics ,  mohamad asif mohseni ,  issued an order on his personal television station that members of his sect must not allow their wives and daughters to attend the unprecedented and historic demonstration in kabul against a law the un says legalises marital rape . 
one of her neighbours ,  halima hosseini ,  also travelled to the demonstration and was horrified by the attempts of local men to stop her . 
but these groups of men ordered us to return to our houses . 
some of them spat in our faces . 
while many women turned back ,  in the end ,  about <num>200</num>  arrived for the protest outside mohsenis imposing mosque and seminary . 
top afghan shiite cleric mohammad asif mohseni speaks during a press conference in kabul on april <num>11</num>  .

the issue that sparked this weeks action was the shia family law ,  a piece of legislation quietly signed into law by president hamid karzai last month after intense pressure from shia clerics . 
it gives husbands wide-ranging powers over their wives who are not allowed to leave the house without their husbands permission or to refuse them sex without a medical excuse . 
what appears to have spurred the women activists was last week's television broadcast by mohseni saying karzai must not bow to western pressure to change the law . 
 " we couldn't agree on whether to have a demonstration until mohseni said that no one has any right to change the law "  ,  said fatima hussaini ,  one of the young activists involved . 
 " we had to show that he is not the only leader of the shia and that he has no right to do this to women .  "

the commandos ,  backed by british special forces ,  unearthed the drugs in the desert near spin boldak ,  in kandahar . 
the area is a popular border crossing linking afghanistans second biggest city with quetta - alleged to be the talibans capital-in-exile ,  in pakistan . 
hundreds of grain sacks ,  stuffed full of hash ,  were hidden deep inside six trenches ,  spread over an area the size of two football fields . 
the trenches were covered with sand ,  making them almost impossible to spot from the air . 
the commandos ,  who share a base with britains special boat service  ( sbs )  ,  discovered the drugs on <num>9</num>  june ,  as part of an operation codenamed albatross ii . 
officials believe it was a massive cannabis factory where drug dealers were turning dried cannabis leaves into resin . 
the troops arrested three people at the site and seized binoculars ,  a satellite phone and a kalashnikov assault rifle . 
the trenches ,  which appeared to have been made by mechanical diggers ,  were spread in pairs . 
in a separate operation on <num>4</num>  june codenamed operation badgers ,  the commandos arrested <num>13</num>  smugglers ,  and seized more than <num>2.5</num>  tonnes of opium ,  worth <num>29.5</num>  $  million . 
the elite <num>333</num>  team ,  backed by sbs commandos ,  killed three insurgents in the raid ,  seized <num>3</num>  sniper rifles ,  <num>15</num>  kalashnikovs ,  three shotguns ,  a rocket propelled grenade and a light anti-aircraft gun ,  military sources revealed . 
khalid said four of the men arrested were from iran ,  seven were from pakistan and two were from afghanistan .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad speaks during a military parade commemorating army day in tehran on april <num>18</num>  .
in the wake of recent news regarding irans response to the international communitys invitation to resume negotiations on its nuclear programme ,  tehran has sent several signals of its diplomatic intentions .

it did not feature its usual surprises and scope ,  although zilzal and naziat missiles ,  armoured vehicles and tanks made in iran were included in the parade .

kashmiri muslim separatist leader to contest indian elections
lone speaks during a news conference at his residence in srinagar april <num>11</num>  .
he is the first senior separatist leader to run for election in india since the1989 revolt against indian rule in kashmir . 
his decision made him the first separatist leader in two decades to contest an election . 
my decision to contest the election is a change in strategy not ideology ,  he said . 
during last years regional elections ,  lone and other separatists ardently campaigned for a boycott ,  urging people to shun the polls . 
a secessionist movement in indian administered kashmir has been ongoing since <num>1989</num>  , and violence there has claimed more than <num>47,000</num>  lives according to official figures . 
human rights groups and ngos ,  however ,  put the death toll at more than twice that number . 
analysts in india say that lones decision to contest elections constitutes an achievement for indian democracy and a set back for separatists in the region . 
syed ali shah geelani ,  the chairman of the hard-line faction of the hurriyat conference ,  renewed the call for a boycott and once again castigated lone for his secret ties with new delhi . 
kashmir ,  a himalayan region ,  is divided between india and pakistan ,  but is claimed in full by both . 
since their independence from britain the two countries have fought three wars ,  two exclusively over kashmir .

an uzbek serial according to a mexican recipe
the well-known uzbek director oybek veysala and his camera crew during the filming of the television serial my love is my destiny
this is associated with great financial expenditures and acquiring and equipping special film studios and training personnel . 
the uzbek viewer expects his own home-grown serial ,  and his hopes will soon be justified . 
we simply need time for this . 
uzbek serials will be filmed in special film studios in tashkent ,  equipped in a state-of-the-art manner . 
the government has assigned the city authorities ,  and also the state committee on management of state property ,  to provide uzbektelefilm ,  on a non-repayable basis and in the shortest period of time ,  with large premises for uzbektelefilms studios . 
other film studios of the uzbekkino national agency will be able to significantly accelerate the process ,  begun in <num>2007</num>  , of renewing their cinema technology . 
last year ,  a tender was issued on purchasing equipment with state-of-the-art modifications from various companies abroad . 
lili van binen-fartokova ,  chairman of the egripment  [ sic ]  support systems for cis and the baltic countries ,  says that ,  many well-known world producers are interested in co-operation with uzbek cinema and television companies ,  and in helping them to re-equip themselves technically . 
in addition to technical re-equipping ,  the uzbek directors intend to conduct a serious analysis of the enormous experience their foreign colleagues have in creating serials . 
a group of analysts from the uzbekkino national agency are already engaged in negotiations about exchanging contacts with their mexican and brazilian colleagues . 
cinema people in india have already expressed their interest in the uzbek governments national serial programme . 
the unique institution of strong family kinship inherent in the uzbek people plays a decisive role in this . 
a recent poll conducted by the uzbek sociological foundation ,  public opinion ,  showed that in terms of ratings ,  the uzbek multi-episode television serials do almost as well as those bought from south korea ,  india ,  mexico and brazil . 
the experts have a simple explanation for this :  uzbek television productions are becoming increasingly realistic and ,  most importantly ,  favourite local actors perform in them . 
according to uzbektelefilm director askar abdurakhimov ,  in <num>2008</num>  several new serials created by uzbek directors will be showing simultaneously .

members of the kurdish community said if law enforcement agencies had not acted quickly the situation would have been worse for the kurds in the village of petrovka . 
kyrgyzstan - the kurdish community in kyrgyzstan opposes the expulsion of kurds from the village of petrovka ,  the site of inter-ethnic clashes on april <num>26</num>  .
ramazan seiidov ,  chairman of midiya ,  an association of kurds in kyrgyzstan ,  requested that kurds in the village be granted refugee status . 
members of the kurdish community asserted that there have been other attacks on ethnic kurds in chui region as well . 
they claimed that their community has been the target of deliberate hostility . 
seiidov attributed the events to actions by third parties who stand to benefit from ethnic tension in the run up to the presidential election later this year . 
he said if law enforcement agencies had not acted quickly in the village of petrovks the situation would have been worse for the kurds . 
talant kurmanov ,  an expert on ethnic relations ,  said almost all ethnic clashes in kyrgyzstan are covered up . 
sooner or later ,  however ,  nationalism or a decision on the distribution of land or water seen as favouring one ethnic group over another could escalate into a serious ethnic conflict ,  he said .

 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ) 
kazakhstan - stockholders of bta bank ,  kazakhstans largest commercial bank ,  have filed two lawsuits against the countrys government for us$1 . 5 billion each . 
in february ,  the kazakhstan government established control over the bank through the samruk-kazyna national welfare fund by purchasing <num>75.1</num>  percent of its stock as part of government measures to support the sector . 
immediately thereafter ,  however ,  two major creditors ,  one of whom was morgan stanley ,  called in loans to the bank valued at us$550 million leading to a <num>66</num>  percent fall in the values of its shares on the kazakhstan stock exchange . 
in response ,  on april <num>20</num>  bta suspended all payments on its principal debt obligations ,  including eurobonds and syndicated and bilateral loans . 
bta board chairman anvar saydenov affirmed ,  however ,  that the bank is continuing to make interest payments on its loans . 
he further noted that international courts will hand down decisions in the lawsuits brought by bta bank stockholders . 
the international rating agency standard  & amp ;  poors lowered the long-term and short-term credit rating of bta banks partner to d / ccc  ( default ,  non-payment ,  or high probability of non-fulfilment of debt obligations ,  but payments continuing )  after the bank announced that it would cease payment on its principal debt . 
another agency ,  fitch ratings ,  lowered the long-term non-payment ratings of the issuing bank from cc  ( very high level of credit risk )  to rd  ( restricted default )  . 
the bank's management stated that the measure suspending payment on its principal debts would be in effect until the bank coordinates and implements a sound ,  transparent and effective programme of managing its actual debt jointly with all its creditors and investors .

leading muslim clerics of three central asian republics - kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  and tajikistan - are willing to join forces to oppose the spread of hiv / aids . 
a round table was recently held in the tajik capital to discuss the creation and development of a central asian information and education centre to assist islamic religious leaders in their fight against hiv / aids . 
apart from the religious leaders ,  other participants included representatives of islamic institutions ,  state agencies and the religious affairs committees operating within central asia ,  as well as representatives of the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  development programme  ( undp )  .

tilek meymanaliev ,  executive director of caap commented to the participants that ,  the latest unaids statistics show the incidence of hiv infection as rising more rapidly in eastern europe and central asia than anywhere else in the world .

dushanbe - after presenting his credentials to tajikistan president rakhmon on may <num>14</num>  , russian ambassador yuri popov stated that problems in russian-tajikistan relations can and should be resolved so that the interests of both sides are taken into consideration to the fullest extent possible . 
during talks after the official ceremony ,  the parties discussed the current situation and the future of tajik-russian cooperation . 
rakhmon expressed dissatisfaction with progress on several bilateral agreements and called for their speedy implementation . 
among them are the construction of three mid-size hydroelectric power plants and the development of gas ,  oil and uranium deposits in tajikistan . 
popov said he believed that much of the media reporting about a cooling in tajik-russian relations is not attuned to reality . 
according to the ambassador ,  his conversation with president rakhmon demonstrates that talk about a change in the status of bilateral relations is unwarranted .

three days earlier ,  on may <num>12</num>  , the fourth system was placed on idle speed . 
work at the construction site is now proceeding around the clock ,  and construction of the station's main turbine room and dam is also continuing . 
the load on each of the construction workers at sangtuda hydroelectric power plant-1 has almost tripled ,  taking into account that part of the international group had already been transferred to the rogunsk construction site .

taliban warn tajikistan
dushanbe - taliban leaders have warned tajikistan that it faces serious consequences if it continues to work with the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  to support its campaign against the taliban ,  taliban political council leader in afghanistan abdul vose mutassim told al-jazeera television . 
mutassim claims the taliban has information that earlier this year tajik authorities allowed their territory to be used to transport non-military <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and nato cargo to afghanistan . 
while he called on the tajik government to stop supporting the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  administration ,  mutassim did not specify what the taliban would do if dushanbe continues to work with the west . 
experts said the taliban statement should not be taken lightly ,  especially since it comes from a man who is one of the talibans most influential leaders and who appears on the terrorist lists of the un security council and several countries . 
the taliban threat could easily become a reality in central asia ,  said tajik political analyst abdugani mamadazimov who pointed out that the taliban against which the pakistani army is fighting includes many people from central asia . 
some might decide to return home ,  he said . 
eurasia expert dmitry popov said ,  the taliban doesnt follow etiquette . 
friends of their enemies are their enemies as well . 
the taliban would have no problem dealing with tajikistan for cooperating with the americans . 
the border with afghanistan is the longest of tajikistans national borders ,  and the taliban is strongest in northern afghanistan .

dushanbe - at a ceremony marking the 15t anniversary of the tajikistan border patrol ,  president emomali rakhmon said that the defence and strengthening of the tajikistan-afghanistan border is important not just for tajikistan but also for cis member states and even for the eu . 
rakhmon emphasised that the traditional drug routes through gorno-badakhshan autonomous region are now being replaced with new ones ;  up to <num>80</num>  percent of drug traffic now goes through the southern khatlon region . 
he noted that in <num>15</num>  years ,  border troops have detained several thousand people who crossed the border illegally and confiscated more than <num>800</num>  trunks of weapons and <num>20</num>  tonnes of drugs . 
despite such successes ,  the quality of work in this area must be improved ,  the president said . 
in <num>2008</num>  , for example ,  border troops detained only <num>20</num>  foreign citizens who were trafficking contraband ,  and only <num>1.3</num>  tonnes of drugs were confiscated . 
thats extremely small if you take into account the total amount of contraband drugs seized . 
in <num>2008</num>  , law enforcement agencies confiscated a total of more than eight tonnes of drugs ,  rakhmon said . 
the tajik border patrol service was formed under difficult economic ,  military and financial conditions during the country's years of civil conflict in the <num>1990</num>  second  . 
russian border troops were on alert at the border ,  while tajik border guards stood as a second line of defence . 
it was not until <num>1994</num>  that the tajik border service was formed and may <num>28</num>  declared as border forces day .

new publications launch in kazakhstan
a number of popular newspapers and magazines have shut down in kazakhstan since the start of the year . 
kazakhstan - two new publications appeared in kazakhstan between may and june despite the tendency for newspapers and magazines to close during the economic crisis . 
both focus on culture and society ,  taking poetry ,  spirituality and history as their subjects . 
on may <num>28</num>  the kazakh presidential fund for the development of the national languages press service announced that the first issue of the magazine kazakh almanac had been released . 
we believe that the magazine will provide a sort of discussion space with truly interesting interlocutors for anyone concerned about our nations development ,  said berik abdygaliev ,  the new magazines editor in chief . 
the first issue opens with a selection of extracts from president nursultan nazarbayevs speeches at sessions of the kazakh peoples assembly . 
the magazine also has articles by famous scholars and publicists . 
since the magazines publisher is an organisation devoted to developing the national language ,  most of the material is in kazakh . 
the newspaper is the first part of a project called the word on the street ,  the goal of which ,  according to the project's creators ,  is to illuminate the literary process ,  search for new authors and new literary forms ,  and create a forum for discussion about contemporary literature ,  as well as introducing readers and authors . 
since the start of the year ,  a number of popular kazakh magazines and newspapers have shut down . 
one of them ,  continent ,  said it was closing due to economic difficulties connected with a crisis in the advertising market . 
most of the other newspapers that shut down were victims of the financial and economic crisis .

 ( photo by maxim marmur / afp / getty images ) 
on june <num>3</num>  , uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan performed a hostage swap ,  exchanging border guards detained by each side the day before . 
the hostage-taking began june <num>2</num>  when kyrgyz border guards detained two uzbek soldiers in kyrgyzstan's batken region ,  accused them of breaking kyrgyz law and announced they were being detained . 
all the hostages were released on the evening of june <num>3</num>  , but only after local authorities intervened . 
the two countries also reached an agreement june <num>3</num>  to re-open the border crossings for ordinary citizens in the fergana valley . 
uzbekistan believes that the armed insurgents slipped across the border from kyrgyzstan ,  while bishkek maintains that its neighbour had failed to keep track of its own extremists . 
meanwhile ,  opposition-oriented uzbek political analyst tashpulat yuldashev told kyrgyzstan's kabar news agency that ,   " the whole blame game ,  in which uzbekistan accuses its neighbours of letting terrorist groups slip across the border ,  is nothing but a ploy to get these countries to the negotiating table . 
once it has accomplished this ,  uzbekistan hopes to be able to dictate its own conditions for resolving issues of contention in the region ,  such as the allocation of water and energy resources .  "

according to league director nazgul turdebekova ,  the criminal verdicts handed down by the court in nookat deprived <num>97</num>  children of the support of one or both parents . 
the benefit was supported by a number of other ngos in the country ,  including interbilim ,  the justice organisation ,  the human rights advocacy centre ,  and the human rights council at kyrgyzstan's office of the ombudsman . 
the organisers of the charitable drive collected foodstuffs ,  toys ,  clothing and school supplies for the children of nookat .

representatives of the country's ngos have noted mixed signals from the government concerning religious observances . 
 " on the one hand ,  we've seen an increase in the number of mosques ,  and large-scale prayer services held in our central squares with participation from the country's leaders . 
at the same time ,  the government's fight against religious radicalism does not distinguish between peaceful muslims and islamic extremists "  ,  turdubekova said . 
the organisers of the charity event have no intention of ceasing activities after their initial food and clothing drive . 
they plan to create a foundation ,  the children of nookat ,  which will work to support all the children who have become social orphans as a result of the harsh sentencing .

 ( photo by wikipedia commons ) 
at the moment ,  ranikot is a hideout for criminals and robbers ,  and we are helpless to stop them because of insufficient resources ,  asad said . 
criminals are using the fort as a motel . 
the fort is somewhat of an archaeological enigma . 
no records of antiquity even mention it ,  let alone indicate how and when it was built . 
foreign historians consider its design and construction to be influenced by arabs ,  others say by greeks or romans ,  and some believe its design and construction were accomplished by the same engineers who built the great wall of china . 
he argues that increasing public awareness of its presence ,  and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive restoration effort before time and bandits degrade it beyond recognition ,  will enhance its tourism potential .

national security officers have intercepted <num>48</num>  drug channels since the beginning of the year ,  including <num>30</num>  international ones . 
they have broken up <num>22</num>  drug groups and confiscated more than <num>250</num>  kilograms of heroin and opium . 
kazakhstans southern regions are called the drug trafficking gates . 
experts believe up to <num>15</num>  percent of afghan opiate drugs are sent to russia and europe through kazakhstan and central asian countries . 
the government confirmed in may that the <num>2009</num>  programme to fight drug trade and drug addiction focuses on stepping up the fight against drug trafficking on the countrys southern border . 
the interior ministry said the objective of the programme is to increase the confiscation of drugs there by <num>15</num>  to <num>20</num>  percent . 
hydroelectricity compromise possible in central asia
tajikistan - a round-table discussion entitled hydroelectric issues in central asia :  compromise possible ? 
was held in dushanbe on june <num>12</num>  .
the independent experts ,  politicians and government officials from tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan who attended the meeting discussed issues related to the construction of the rogun hydroelectric power plant in tajikistan and the kambaratinsk hydroelectric plant in kyrgyzstan . 
the round table was organised by the institute for war and peace reporting  ( iwpr )  . 
the uzbek government declined to send representatives to the meeting in dushanbe . 
according to the director of the tajik centre for strategic research ,  suhrob sharipov ,  a solution must be found to the issue of the use of hydroelectric resources . 
no other government ,  he said ,  should interfere with the construction of the rogun hydroelectric power plant since the hydroelectric complex is being built on the river vakhsh ,  which is not a trans-border river . 
the vakhsh passes <num>100</num>  kilometres from the border with uzbekistan and merges with the river pyandzh . 
what is very important is that the nations in the region live in peace and harmony ,  but they must also have heating and lighting . 
the uzbek authorities and experts are being very critical with regard to the construction of the rogun hydroelectric plant ,  but are not themselves offering anything . 
bulat auyelbayev ,  a representative of the kazakh centre for strategic research ,  believes it is a governments right to use its countrys natural resources ,  including water . 
on the other hand ,  he said ,  uzbekistans position is understandable since the uzbek government is being forced to reduce the amount of irrigated land used for cotton-growing and this could lead to discontent among the countrys rural population . 
just as the tajik government fears public anger over the lack of lighting and heating ,  the uzbek authorities fear discontent because of water shortages and a reduction in the amount of irrigated land ,  the expert commented . 
rashid gani abdullo ,  a tajik political analyst ,  asserts that a compromise is possible if political and economic conditions are equal in all countries in the region . 
in his view ,  tajikistan and kyrgyzstan will stand on an equal political footing on the issue of the use of hydroelectric resources only after the rogun and kambaratinsk hydroelectric plants have been built . 
pakistani textiles earn more than half of the countrys annual income from exports . 
 ( reuters / athar hussain ) 
karachi - in the face of growing terrorism and the absence of financial incentives at home ,  leading textile manufacturers in pakistan are considering relocating abroad during the next fiscal year  ( fy )  starting july <num>1</num>  .
fy <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  seems to be the year of relocation for the leading textile groups in pakistan ,  said akbar sheikh ,  chairman of the all pakistan textile mills association  ( aptma )  in punjab . 
bangladesh ,  tunisia and china are the most attractive countries for pakistani manufacturers to build in ,  he asserts . 
to attract foreign investors they offer tax-exemptions ,  low-cost electricity and business loans at the lowest rates . 
an aptma delegation is currently visiting tunisia to explore the feasibility of relocating textile units or establishing new ones there ,  sheikh said . 
tunisia permits duty-free textile exports to european countries ,  and it is located close to the continent ,  he said . 
for manufacturers of value-added textile products ,  tunisia would be a much better choice than bangladesh or china . 
in pakistan the cost of electricity ,   [ taxes ]  and inflation are the highest in the world ,  said aptma secretary anisul haq . 
 [ this ]  erodes the competitiveness and profitability of our products . 
growing incidents of terrorism have also increased uncertainty in the country and increased the anxiety of textile importers abroad . 
other aptma members said two major players in the industry ,  afroze and noori textile mills ,  have already established units in bangladesh and may locate more units abroad in <num>2009</num> -<num>10</num>  .
the pakistani textile industry accounts for more than <num>50</num>  percent of the nations total annual export income . 
in the first <num>10</num>  months of fy <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  , textile exports earned us$7 . 9 billion out of the <num>14.76</num>  $  billion national total .

chitral district residents divided on forest issues
general view of trees covered with fresh snow in pakistan . 
islamabad - forest depletion is one of the most serious environmental issues facing pakistan ,  and in chitral district ,  residents and district council members are divided on how best to cope with its consequences . 
chitral district is located at <num>4,900</num>  feet  ( <num>1,493</num>  metres )  above sea level and has a total area of <num>14,850</num>  sq km ,  more than <num>60</num>  percent of which is covered by forest . 
members of the district council ,  however ,  argued that the forests adjoining the three valleys of kalash are full of old trees that need to be removed to provide space and light for the nourishment of saplings . 
council member saifullah jan said forest fires occur frequently in the summer season and burn to ashes hundreds of precious deodar trees . 
but the residents of barkatullah say they are fully aware of the importance of their forests and will not allow anyone to destroy them for their own benefit . 
murad khan said illegal deforestation is playing with the bright future of the chitrali people for  [ the sole purpose ]  of amassing wealth . 
residents warned that the environment of chitral will be destroyed and flash floods will sweep away the fertile land in the valleys if the illegal cutting is not stopped . 
according to a <num>2006</num>  survey conducted by the agricultural university of faisalabad ,  pakistans deforestation rate is <num>1.5</num>  percent annually and many people are focused more on economic rather than on environmental concerns . 
despite the volatility of the issue ,  the government has yet to make any effort to resolve the problem . 
the fight against illegal drug trafficking in tajikistan
a batch of drugs weighing abut <num>300</num>  kilogram  is prepared for destruction
the threat from drugs is a serious danger in any country ,  regardless of its geographical position ,  political system ,  or state of economic well-being . 
in early june ,  using a special oven ,  the drug control agency  ( dca )  under the countrys president ,  destroyed about <num>300</num>  kilograms of narcotics after they had been used as evidence in criminal cases . 
this total was made up of raw opium ,  heroin ,  cannabis ,  and hashish . 
the head of illegal drugs under the tajik ministry of internal affairs ,  abdul rozikov ,  said that since the beginning of <num>2008</num>  alone the republics law enforcement and power blocks have together seized about <num>3</num>  tons of drugs - about <num>50</num>  percent of which was raw opium . 
previously ,  drug dealers were trying to work with heroin ,  but lately a trend toward smuggling raw opium is being seen . 
drugs being burned in a special oven
the head of the dcas investigation department ,  dzhumaboy malikov said that as a result of special operations conducted jointly by the police services from countries bordering afghanistan under the codename target ,  some <num>132</num>  kilograms of various precursors were seized ,  with the most common being acetic acid anhydride . 
in addition ,  malikov said ,  two drug laboratories were destroyed on afghan territory and about <num>166</num>  kilograms of heroin ,  <num>16</num>  kilograms of raw opium ,  <num>1,000</num>  litres of liquid raw opium and <num>26</num>  kilograms of opium poppy seed were seized . 
each year the target special operations are conducted with participation from special police services throughout central asia . 
representatives from the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and eu serve as observers . 
according to rozikov ,  this kind of co-operation started to occur when drugs stopped being a problem that was limited to only a single state or region . 
recognising this ,  the states of the world are joining together in international organizations for the purpose of intensifying an effective fight against illegal drug trafficking . 
in the mid-1990s ,  tajikistan subscribed to three <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  international conventions in the sphere of drug control . 
within the framework of the cis ,  the shanghai co-operation organization ,  the organization for central asian co-operation and other international organizations ,  the republic of tajikistan has signed <num>15</num>  inter-governmental agreements fighting drugs trafficking . 
the tajik government seeks to strengthen the security of the tajik-afghan border ,  and purge corruption in law and border enforcement to limit drugs activity in the area .

dushanbe - the women of tajikistans khatlon region are demanding economic equality . 
public hearings were held in the tajik city of kurgan-tyube on providing women with equal access to economic resources in society ,  including land ,  real estate ,  other property ,  financial instruments ,  credit and entrepreneurial opportunities . 
according to nargis bozorova ,  a member of the tajik coalition of civil society organisations ,  the countrys land code needs to be amended to improve womens position in agriculture since it contains virtually no provision for gender equality . 
our coalition intends to send proposals regarding the land code to the lower chamber of parliament by june <num>30</num>  , she said . 
if voted into law ,  they will substantively change the status of women in agriculture . 
participants at the public hearings in kurgan-tyube adopted a resolution saying that ,  despite some positive measures and concrete steps taken by the tajik president and government to elevate the role and status of women in society ,  an analysis of gender relations shows that they have been inadequate in establishing real equality between women and men in the country .

kazakhstan - kazakh ministry of foreign affairs press secretary ilyas omarov announced that <num>27</num>  kazakh nationals who were arrested in uzbekistan and charged with illegally crossing the border ,  violating customs regulations and stealing large gas pipelines will be deported back to kazakhstan after paying fines . 
the kazakhs maintain that they did not steal anything and that there were no signs marking the location of the border . 
employees of the company that dispatched them ,  however ,  were subsequently arrested in kazakhstan and charged with economic contraband . 
the supreme court of karakalpakstan ,  however ,  ordered the defendants to pay hefty fines of around us$10 , 000 and also impounded the kazakhs lorries . 
leader of an action group formed by relatives of the defendants aidos sadykov said that the courts verdict was not harsh but that the fines imposed were in excess of what the families could raise quickly . 
he bemoaned the fact that the kazakh ministry of foreign affairs had done nothing to help the men . 
omarov countered that ,  there are provisions of international law that stipulate that a citizen of one state who has committed an offence in the territory of another state must be punished in accordance with the laws of the country where he committed the offence . 
in this case ,  the kazakhs broke uzbek law and were held accountable <abbr>…</abbr>  the kazakh foreign ministry has no right to intervene .

afghan courts gain in popularity but challenges remain
more than two decades of war and instability shattered afghanistans institutions including its legal system . 
throughout most of the country ,  regional warlords held strongholds and established their own militia groups . 
today though ,  afghans throughout the country are feeling the protection of a functioning judicial system for the very first time . 
efforts to rebuilt the countrys judiciary system began after the fall of the taliban in <num>2001</num>  when the interim government was established using the <num>1964</num>  constitution as its foundation . 
cases in the provincial high courts have included cases involving land disputes ,  robberies ,  murders and human rights violations . 
sometimes we can spend up to six months on one case but people need to understand that we have to make sure and that this is necessary in order to give a fair sentence ,  explained mohammad jora ,  a judge in baghlans provincial high court . 
the provincial courts also work with traditional jirgas and elders in the communities to help settle disputes . 
according to our tradition we refer to our elders ,  especially when it comes to land disputes . 
if the problem cant be solved in the community ,  it will be brought to the attention of the court ,  added jora . 
after our father died ,  we had to share between us the land he left behind . 
we were able to reach an agreement about everything apart from the garden . 
we trusted that a final and fair decision would be handed out by the court ,  said khoshal .

kazakhstan - the third congress of leaders of world and traditional religions opened july <num>1</num>  in astana . 
kazakh authorities created the forum to help reduce religious wars and conflicts through civilised discussions among representatives of various faiths ,  denominations and sects . 
about <num>60</num>  delegations representing major religious communities took part in the forum ,  as did officials from influential international organisations . 
participants included israeli president shimon peres ,  un deputy secretary-general sergei orjonikidze ,  osce secretary-general mark perren de brishambo and spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos . 
congress participants considered the role of religious leaders in peace-building based on tolerance ,  mutual respect and cooperation ,  and the state of moral and spiritual values in the contemporary world . 
they also defined the basis for dialogue ,  cooperation and solidarity among representatives of various religious denominations . 
at the congress ,  kazakh president nursultan nazarbaev proposed creating a council of religious leaders for dialogue and cooperation with other forums and international organisations whose work focuses on a dialogue of cultures and economic cooperation . 
the kazakh leader reiterated his enthusiasm for the direction of <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  leadership in moving towards an understanding with the muslim world . 
he called it a sign that important changes are beginning to happen in the world . 
nazarbaev also outlined his vision for an ideal state of world affairs in which a fair economic model is based on honest competition among the world financial and monetary systems ,  with no room for fraud or wastefulness ,  and all the boons created by humankind are aimed at advancing the progress of every person . 
in his opinion ,  the world crisis is in large part appropriate . 
the economic development of the past decade ,  the gigantic leap in technology ,  could not resolve eternal questions such as poverty and hunger . 
speaking at the congress ,  israeli president shimon peres proposed discussing a peace plan between israel and the arab world in kazakhstan . 
from this global podium i ask king abdullah of saudi arabia ,  initiator of the arab peace initiative ,  to come to kazakhstan ,  and together with other arab leaders ,  discuss our vision of a peaceful future world .

around <num>5,000</num>  of tajikistan's muslims make a pilgrimage to saudi arabia each year . 
last year ,  the average cost of the hajj for a tajik pilgrim was about us$3 , 000
since the average monthly income in tajikistan is less than <num>60</num>  $  , only the country's well-to-do can afford the trip . 
each year ,  millions of islam's faithful ,  clad in white ,  gather at mecca's al-haram mosque to pray . 
during the hajj ,  pilgrims are expected to leave behind their normal lives and the comforts of modern society to gather under the fierce sun and perform required religious rites . 
foreign debt surged to <num>50</num>  $  billion while domestic debt mounted to <num>49</num>  $  billion ,  economist dr ashfaque hasan said .

capital market analysts said the total debt of pakistan is now as large as its gdp ,  which reflects a very weak economy . 
in the next three years pakistans debt could exceed <num>130</num>  $  billion with increased loans from the imf ,  wb and other international sources ,  which will reflect ongoing economic weaknesses .

incidentally ,  nizomov is the son of mirzokhudzhy nizomov ,  the military commander of the former tajik opposition forces . 
drug abuse among women of punjab increasing
we are living in a country where drug abuse has  [ become ]  like a cancer at the heart of our society ,  bakshi said . 
greater attention should be paid to create awareness among the people about the dangers of drug abuse and the ways to avoid it . 
clinical psychologist dr mahmooda aftab said ,  worth noticing is that many addicted woman refuse to go into drug rehabilitation programs . 
they are outpatients because of the shame and stigma attached to substance dependence and addiction . 
they cannot stay in rehabilitation centers for cultural reasons and only go for medicine and advice . 
the barriers to treatment for women must be addressed ;  most programmes are not geared to the needs of women . 
according to the international labour organisation projections ,  the proportion of the working poor in central asia is set to rise to <num>23</num>  percent of the population . 
 ( photo by viktor drachev / afp / getty images ) 
during the july <num>8</num>  session of the uns geneva-based economic and social council ,  un general secretary ban ki-moon presented a report on implementing the millennium development goals . 
the document estimates that one out of five central asians live in conditions of extreme poverty . 
in april ,  the world bank published a projection stating that ,  following <num>10</num>  years of steady growth and successful anti-poverty measures ,  countries in eastern europe and central asia have been broadsided by consequences of the global financial meltdown . 
it asserts that more than <num>35</num>  million people who had recently risen out of poverty now find themselves in a vulnerable position . 
projections of the international labour organisation show that the percentage of the working poor in the  [ central asian ]  region fell between <num>1997</num>  and <num>2007</num>  from <num>26</num>  percent to <num>21</num>  percent ,  but that now has crept back up to <num>23</num>  percent ,  the publication noted . 
these worsening trends were captured in the failed states index <num>2009</num>  , compiled by us think tank fund for peace and respected magazine foreign policy . 
the ratings reflect the capacity of governments to maintain internal stability and are based on <num>12</num>  categories ,  including demographic parameters ;  mass movements of refugees or internally displaced persons ;  unsustainable economic development ;  sharp economic decline ;  criminalisation or delegitimisation of the state ;  deterioration of public services and human rights violations .

lahore - sources in the punjab archeology department  ( pad )  disclosed july <num>8</num>  that the shalimar garden is still included on the unesco list of endangered historic sites around the world despite a us$614 , 000 grant this year from the punjab government . 
the garden has been ignored for the last <num>26</num>  years . 
crumbling walls have marred its beauty . 
in <num>2007</num>  , the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> -based getty foundation granted <num>2.5</num>  $  million through unesco to the pad for the restoration and conservation of the eastern and western gates of shalimar gardens and the royal bath . 
so far ,  however ,  only <num>25</num>  percent to <num>30</num>  percent of the work has been completed . 
tajikistan's population approaching <num>8</num>  million
tajikistans population growth rate hovers around <num>2.2</num>  percent annually . 
 ( china photos / getty images ) 
tajikistan - tajikistans current population stands at more than <num>7.5</num>  million ,  according to figures provided at a july <num>7</num>  press conference by chairman of the state statistics committee mirgand shakhbozov . 
by the beginning of next year ,  that figure may reach <num>8</num>  million ,  including migrant labourers currently living abroad . 
the countrys rural residents are <num>73</num>  percent of the total population that is growing annually between <num>2.1</num>  and <num>2.2</num>  percent . 
more than half the population is under <num>50</num>  years of age . 
according to shakhbozov ,  no more than <num>400,000</num>  tajik citizens are currently working abroad . 
the estimates of several international organisations putting the number of migrant labourers abroad at around <num>1</num>  million simply do not square with reality ,  he stated . 
still ,  the boom has some in the dushanbe municipal administration worried ,  and the capitals authorities plan to introduce a cap on the number of people living in dushanbe . 
city mayor mamadsaid ubaydullayev pointed out that while dushanbes population increases every year ,  the citys ability to keep expanding its geographic limits has been exhausted . 
recently weve been able to increase its size by annexing parcels from the neighbouring rudaki district and pushed the citys total area to nearly <num>13,000</num>  hectares ,  "  he said . 
 " but we plan to ask the federal government to cap the population of the capital at <num>1</num>  million .  " 
tajik officials have at different times attempted to reduce birth rates in the country through public information campaigns . 
without having imposed mandatory limits on family size ,  however ,  those efforts have proven utterly ineffective . 
pakistan sets record planting mangroves
keti bandar - the sindh forest department and the federal environment ministry set a world record by planting <num>541,176</num>  mangroves in less than <num>15</num>  hours on a barren island near keti bandar ,  about <num>90</num>  kilometer  from karachi ,  on july <num>15</num>  .
the feat will be entered into the guinness book of world records ,  it was announced at the event . 
the planting was supervised by local observers and mangroves international expert tahir qureshi . 
also in attendance at the event were designated representatives of the guinness book administration ,  a number of government dignitaries ,  members of the media ,  folk performers ,  singers and residents of the coastal belt . 
since it was not necessary to dig pits for planting mangrove trees under a new ruling set by the guinness book ,  planters were able to finish the newest record-breaking task in less than <num>15</num>  hours . 
experts say that while oil spills and the cutting of mangroves for firewood have led to a decline in their numbers in pakistan ,  the project will aid in raising awareness about forest conservation and rehabilitation . 
india ,  pakistan to share intelligence
new delhi-india and pakistan agreed july <num>16</num>  to increase communication and information-sharing in an effort to prevent terrorist attacks ,  and said dialogue was the only way forward in the wake of violence such as novembers siege in mumbai . 
until now ,  new delhi had insisted that pakistan take concrete and demonstrable action to prevent cross-border terrorism as a precondition for the resumption of peace talks . 
the joint statement ,  however ,  said that ,  action on terror should not be linked to the composite dialogue process  [ because ] … terrorism is the main threat to both countries . 
gilani called the meeting a major breakthrough ,  according to the press trust of india . 
singh told reporters that he sought an assurance from gilani that there would be no repeat of attacks like the mumbai siege . 
you give us information whenever any such threat exists . 
we will work with india to prevent such things from happening ,  singh said .

typically ,  operation poppy is implemented in two phases . 
during the period from may to july ,  all efforts are focused on destroying plants under cultivation and in the wild ,  while during august through november ,  law enforcement turns its attention to shutting down delivery routes to prevent the drugs from reaching the market . 
the narcotics control agency  ( nca )  reported that during the first phase of the operation ,  conducted between may <num>10</num>  and july <num>15</num>  , over a tonne of narcotics was pulled off the street ,  including <num>355</num>  kilos of heroin ,  <num>271</num>  kilos of opium precursor and <num>426</num>  kilos of drugs in the cannabis group . 
spot inspections of garden and farm plots revealed <num>72</num>  areas where cannabis grew as a weed across a total affected area of <num>15,000</num>  hectares . 
 " during the operation ,  we beefed up checkpoints across tajikistan and posted mobile units along major arteries of drug trafficking routes ,  "  nca press director sadulo rakhmatulloyev said . 
prime minister yousuf raza gilani at the prime ministers residence in islamabad ,  pakistan . 
 ( press association via ap images ) 
islamabad - citing current national conditions as not conducive to local elections ,  prime minister yusuf raza gilani announced july <num>8</num>  that the national government will appoint administrators to replace the nazim system of locally elected mayors and other local officials across the country beginning <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
sindh minister for local government agha siraj durrani claimed that all provinces reported the nazim system was a failure and that there was a consensus to revive the appointed provincial commissioner and deputy commissioner system . 
he said that ,  the local bodies system has become a provincial subject and provincial governments will decide all related affairs . 
once the administrators tenures expire ,  an election date will be announced for reinstatement of the nazim system if security conditions permit ,  durrani added . 
poll data suggests pakistanis have a considerable faith in their local / municipal governments and are satisfied with the way the nazims functioned . 
the popularity of the local bodies system is believed to be a direct result of relatively easy access ordinary citizens had to local mayors and community leaders . 
pakistan-made hatf series missiles are on display in a parade in islamabad ,  pakistan . 
last month ,  terrorist commander mustafa abu al-yazid vowed to use pakistan's nuclear weapons against the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  if al-qaeda can get its hands on them . 
pakistan's army has complete control of the country's nuclear weapons and relies on a rudimentary electronic lock on its nuclear arsenal  " similar to the banking industry's  ' chip and pin '  to ensure that even if weapons fall into terrorist hands they can not be detonated ,  "  gregory says . 
 " despite these elaborate safeguards ,  empirical evidence points to a clear set of weaknesses and vulnerabilities in pakistan's nuclear safety and security arrangements ,  "  he warns . 
one glaring concern is that most of pakistan's nuclear sites are located in areas of the country that are now threatened by pakistani taliban militants . 
gregory points out that in november <num>2007</num>  a suicide bomber killed eight people in an attack on a nuclear missile storage facility at sargodha ,  south of islamabad . 
 " the significance of these events is difficult to overstate ,  "  gregory says . 
 " civilian nuclear weapons sites ,  those sites where pakistan's nuclear weapons are manufactured ,  assembled or taken for refurbishment ,  are typically less protected than military sites .  " 
the recent pakistani government offensive against the taliban and al-qaeda in the north-west frontier province and pakistan's tribal areas may help eliminate the threat . 
 " nevertheless ,  more steps must be taken before the threat is neutralized and pakistan's nuclear weapons no longer pose an existential danger to the rest of the world ,  "  gregory concludes . 
pakistani honey holds therapeutic qualities
a pakistani bee keeper inspects his honeycombs . 
typhoid is both a global and local problem . 
between <num>16</num>  million and <num>33</num>  million cases occur worldwide ,  causing between <num>500,000</num>  to <num>600,000</num>  deaths each year . 
currently ,  <num>93</num>  percent of those cases occur in asia ,  and the disease is endemic in pakistan . 
the uhs researchers study on honey and its antimicrobial potential against multi-drug resistant strains of typhoid bacteria is the first of its kind . 
it was presented at the seventh german apitherapy ,  apipuncture and bee products congress in passau ,  germany . 
the study was carried out by a team led by uhs microbiology department head dr abdul hannan . 
members of his team included dr muhammad barkaat ,  sidrah saleem ,  muhammad usman and waseem ahmed gilani . 
the research team also found that honey helps in the treatment of some wounds better than the most modern antibiotics . 
its healing properties have been mentioned in historic and religious documents . 
the uhs study revealed that certain varieties of honey can promote the growth of normal microbial flora like the lactobacilli and bifid bacterium species . 
this is not the case with antibiotics that might create an imbalance leading to serious drug-resistant infections . 
honey also prevents the adherence of salmonella to intestinal epithelium . 
above all ,  honey does not allow a microorganism to develop resistance . 
a clinical trial indicated that honey at a concentration of <num>5</num>  percent shortens the duration of bacterial diarrhea caused by shigella ,  salmonella and escherichia coli in infants and children ,  said barkaat . 
it has also been found effective in the treatment of dyspepsia ,  gastric and duodenal ulcers .

he maintained that the entry of new members ,  especially foreign investors ,  could provide good support for stock market growth for the rest of this year . 
the stock market is gradually gaining strength ,  and prices of the blue chips are rising steadily as the economy of the country is moving towards recovery and growth ,  jovc coo ahmed nabil asserted . 
at present ,  almost all blue chips are under-valued ,  he said ,  and are attractive for short and long-term investment .

ireland - on july <num>29</num>  , after a meeting with <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ambassador to ireland dan rooney ,  ireland's minister of justice dermot ahern announced that two uzbekistan citizens who were imprisoned at guantanamo will be transferred to ireland . 
according to ahern ,  they risk being subjected to persecution and torture again if they return to their country . 
several months ago ,  amnesty international ireland organised a campaign to transfer several guantanamo prisoners to ireland . 
one of them is oybek djabbarov ,  who was captured in northern afghanistan in <num>2001</num>  .
he had lived in mazar-i-sharif ,  afghanistan ,  with his family since <num>1999</num>  and was a member of the islamic movement of uzbekistan . 
the uzbekistan government considers the imu a terrorist organisation . 
a native of the namangan region ,  <num>30</num> -year-old djabbarov was freed by <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  authorities in <num>2008</num>  but did not want to return to uzbekistan ,  fearing for his life and health and the safety of his wife and two children . 
because no country in the world would accept him at that time ,  he remained at guantanamo . 
according to <num>2006</num>  pentagon information ,  there were six uzbekistan citizens held at guantanamo . 
the majority of guantanamo prisoners will be transferred to other countries of the world . 
several ,  including portugal ,  italy ,  belgium ,  albania ,  latvia and estonia ,  have already agreed to take in prisoners who are not their nationals .

srinagar - pakistans livestock and dairy farming sectors will soon receive a boost from australian scientists working with their local counterparts ,  said a government official on <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>3</num>  .
the programme ,  initiated in <num>2007</num>  , began with the objective of transferring australian knowledge and expertise to key sectors of pakistans agribusiness to increase its profitability and enhance its export potential . 
the scientists involved have chosen horticulture  ( mango and citrus cultivation )  and livestock  ( dairy )  as the primary areas upon which to focus . 
by the end of the programme ,  a number of small pakistani farmers should no longer face impoverishment ;  the achievements of research and development will enhance their future productivity . 
tajik women trafficked to arab countries through neighbouring states

 ( photo by andreas rentz / getty images ) 
dushanbe - tajik women trafficked to arab countries are sent there through other countries . 
deputy director of dushanbe airport aziz ibrogimov said it is forbidden for women who are under <num>30</num>  to fly to arab countries unaccompanied . 
that measure was taken to prevent the trade of women that is already the third most profitable form of criminal trade in the world ,  following only weapons and drug trafficking ,  ibrogimov said . 
the criminals luring women into sexual slavery get them out of the country through moscow ,  bishkek and almaty ,  he said . 
in reality ,  however ,  the government has not shown great zeal in prosecuting state officials involved in human trafficking or providing the victims access to legal advice . 
experts add that tajikistans system for aiding the victims of human trafficking is inadequate . 
the country has only one centre for that purpose set up with an imo donation . 
human trafficking within tajikistan is also a problem . 
young women from remote villages are often brought to urban areas as sex slaves . 
men and children are also victims of human trafficking ,  often sent to russia for forced labour .

the area under floriculture cultivation is estimated to be around  [ 405h ]  ,  and the land has been already earmarked ,  said federal commerce minister makhdoom amin fahim . 
by strengthening its floriculture sector ,  pakistan intends to supply the flowers to markets in the uae ,  saudi arabia and the eu . 
flower exports can earn much foreign exchange ,  said mushtaq khan ,  a florist . 
to make money ,  though ,  there is a need to develop proper systems for the business . 
the majority of pakistani flower varieties are grown during winter ,  unlike europe ,  where snow prevents production . 
florists say this provided an excellent opportunity for the countrys floriculture sector to fulfill the demand of european markets and emerge as a leader in the field . 
phdeb ,  under the umbrella of the ministry of commerce ,  has initiated a number of steps to develop the floriculture sector in the country . 
a project for the establishment of floriculture common facilities farms has been submitted to the planning commission for funding ,  fahim said . 
the project will be export oriented and serve as role model for floriculture . 
they and other ornamental plants are primarily grown around karachi ,  hyderabad ,  lahore ,  rawalpindi ,  islamabad ,  multan ,  faisalabad and quetta .

 ( photo :  yeon-je / afp / getty images ) 
tajikistan - tajikistan refused to extradite former kyrgyz defense ministry officer mukhammadi salimzode who was convicted by the supreme court in may of spying and a coup attempt . 
the tajik prosecutor generals office said salimzode had infringed on the countrys constitutional integrity with his criminal activity . 
retired colonel mukhammadi salimzode ,  who served in kyrgyzstans defense ministry following the collapse of the soviet union ,  disappeared in august <num>2008</num>  after he arrived in tajikistan to attend his daughters wedding . 
tajik law enforcement agencies only reported his arrest in january . 
he was charged under two articles of tajikistans criminal code - international spying and an attempt to seize power by force . 
the supreme court of tajikistan found him guilty and sentenced him to <num>29</num>  years in prison . 
salimzode maintained his innocence and said the case against him had been fabricated . 
the local media said salimzode had contacted leaders of the tajik opposition . 
summer camp in tajikistan will help rehabilitate landmine victims
in addition to destroying anti-personnel landmines and clearing areas of mines ,  the ottawa convention mandates that countries conduct programs to assist anti-personnel landmine victims . 
 ( photo by karim sahib / afp / getty images ) 
anti-personnel landmines were used in tajikistan during the civil conflict in the early <num>1990</num>  second  . 
since then ,  almost <num>800</num>  citizens have been injured by them ,  and <num>354</num>  have died from landmine injuries . 
according to tclp data ,  more than <num>500,000</num>  square metres of mined areas have been cleared and more than <num>1,000</num>  landmines and shells have been located and destroyed . 
to comply with ottawa convention obligations ,  however ,  tajikistan must clear an additional million square metres of mined land by the end of next year . 
the country has requested an extention of the deadline by another ten years to meet these requirements . 
according to radjabov ,  the main reason for the extension is a lack of financial resources and modern technology ,  particularly the specialised machinery needed to clear mines ,  which cost upwards of us$500 , 000 per unit . 
pakistani government promotes family planning

lahore - the ministry of population welfare has been utilising art as a tool to educate people on family planning ,  said punjab population welfare department  ( pwd )  secretary rao manzar hyatt on aug <num>8</num>  .
last november ,  pakistani taliban commander hakimullah mehsud  ( c )  talked with media reporters in the mamouzai area of orakzai agency . 
 ( a . 
among those killed ,  officials said ,  were maulvi ikramuddin ,  mehsuds father-in-law ,  and ikramuddins two sons and brother . 
taliban militants accused those slain of tipping off authorities about mehsuds whereabouts at the time of his killing . 
according to our information they all have been killed ,  rehman malik ,  the federal interior minister ,  told reporters . 
the taliban have not claimed responsibility for the deaths . 
several weeks ago ,  militants killed one of mehsuds drivers apparently based on allegations that the driver had spied for the government . 
also slain was saadullah mehsud ,  a medic who treated baitullah mehsuds kidney ailment . 
because the missile hit the house shortly after mehsuds medic had departed ,  the taliban also accused him of passing information to the authorities ,  according to a government official . 
 " hakimullah seems to have overpowered his rivals and managed to get himself elected through intimidation ,  but the tussle is far from over ,  "  said mahmood shah ,  a retired army brigadier and a former security chief in pakistan's tribal regions . 
 " his nomination could lead to bloody clashes between the rival factions ,  "  he added . 
tajik students freed from harvesting cotton this year
due to the massive migration of tajik men to earn money abroad ,  women and children are often the only ones left to work the cotton fields . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
tajikistan - tajik agricultural minister kasym kasymov has announced that tajik university students will not be called upon to harvest cotton this year . 
according to the ministrys press service ,  many of the countrys cotton farms are able to bring in the harvest on their own ,  so there is little need to oblige students to contribute . 
the only difficulties the ministry anticipates could occur in a handful of sparsely populated mountainous districts ,  such as the matchin and zafarabad districts of sogdi region ,  where large quantities of cotton are grown . 
critics of the move are already saying that the <num>2009</num>  harvest will not be brought in on time without mandatory student labour . 
with many tajik men working abroad ,  it is mostly women and children who work in the cotton fields . 
until now ,  students have been compelled to work on the harvest and have provided invaluable assistance in bringing in the crop . 
this practice goes back to the soviet era ,  when working conditions were better . 
according to the human rights organisation amparo ,  students in independent tajikistan have until now lived in unheated ,  crumbling ,  unsanitary buildings and sleep for the most part on the floor during the harvest season . 
students work eight or nine hours a day ,  seven days a week in the fields with a daily food ration limited to tea ,  bread and vegetable soup . 
refusal to take part in the harvest means being barred from entering institutions of higher education . 
it is not only university students who have been called up for the harvest ,  but schoolchildren as well . 
according to international organisations ,  tajik university students and children usually bring in up to <num>40</num>  percent of the harvest for very little pay ,  and to the detriment of their health and education . 
for several months of work in the cotton fields ,  they make an average of less than us$20 . 
according to tajik human rights activists ,  the practice of employing students and schoolchildren to harvest cotton is a serious violation of tajikistans international human rights obligations . 
pakistan moves to double remittances in three years
federal finance minister shaukat tarin ,  state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  governor syed ali raza ,  overseas pakistanis minister dr farooq sattar ,  and senior bank officials from around the country attended the pakistan remittance initiative  ( pri )  in karachi that initiated the endeavour . 
tarin said a call centre has already been established for overseas pakistanis and their families to inquire about operation specifics of the pri plan or to lodge complaints . 
before the launch of the initiative ,  a precise assessment was carried out that showed that no national institution had been designated owner of pakistans remittance structures . 
the sbp chief pointed out that remittances increased by <num>100</num>  percent in the last five years ,  and asserted that they had the potential to double to us$14 billion in just three more years . 
he called on banks in pakistan to increase their efforts to attract further remittances ,  adding said that sbp has formed a focus group of five large banks to develop procedures to ensure the instant transfer of remittances from foreign to domestic financial institutions .

the prosecutor generals office was not the first agency that the workers appealed to . 
on june <num>12</num>  they filed a complaint to the state service for labour monitoring ,  employment and social protection . 
the matter has yet to be resolved ,  however . 
a new taliban code of conduct includes much discussion of winning over  " civilian muslims "  by limiting civilian bloodshed . 
 " the utmost effort should be made to avoid civilian casualties ,  "  the code states . 
however ,  is it likely that these provisions will be implemented ? 
although  " new "  to the general public ,  this code was distributed to taliban commanders in <abbr>may.</abbr> 
in the period since then ,  insurgent attacks resulting in civilian deaths have not declined ,  and in some cases have actually increased . 
according to the code ,  nato troops ,  senior afghan army officers and government officials may be executed ,  but only with the permission of mullah omar or one of his deputies . 
nato commanders denounced the  ' code '  as a propaganda exercise aimed at persuading afghan civilians that it is a disciplined force following the rules of war . 
 " it seems to be a form of propaganda to try to show there is a central control over the insurrection ,  "  said international security assistance force spokesman brigadier general eric tremblay . 
he said the code was a sham and that its  " rules "  had been exposed as fabrication by the <num>90</num>  suicide bombings the taliban have carried out this year . 
forty percent of their victims were civilians ,  he said . 
a spokesman for afghanistan's defence ministry also denounced the taliban code's warning against attacks on government employees and abuse of prisoners of war . 
he said taliban militants had seized and beheaded an afghan soldier in paktika province this month . 
a military officer summed up the general sentiments concisely ,  saying  " the long and the short of it is ,  the taliban don't operate in accordance with their code of conduct .  "

the kcts project envisions a new transportation system to pump oil from the tenghiz and kashagan fields to baku ,  azerbaijan . 
the kcts project also includes the trans-caspian system ,  a network of oil terminals on the kazakh and azeri shores of the caspian sea ,  a fleet of oil tankers ,  and infrastructure to connect the system to the baku-tibilisi-ceyhan  ( btc )  pipeline . 
the leaders of azerbaijan ,  kazakhstan ,  russia and turkmenistan are expected to convene in aktau between september <num>11</num>  and <num>13</num>  to revisit the thorny issues of sharing rights to the caspian seabed . 
 " the summit will be an informal gathering ,  with the agenda set by the presidents themselves . 
energy cooperation in general is also likely to be on table for discussion ,  "  said kazakh ambassador to azerbaijan serik primbetov . 
moscow is widely expected to return to the idea of creating the caspian economic cooperation organisation  ( ceco )  ,  which is regarded as a hindrance to plans of bypassing russian territory entirely to export oil to europe . 
moscow has expressed opposition to the nabucco project and other alternate transportation routes for central asian hydrocarbon exports to europe . 
instead ,  it has approached kazakhstan and turkmenistan with a proposal to build a pipeline along the caspian shore to russian territory and from there ,  to european consumers . 
this would preserve moscow's position as the main energy supplier to europe ,  a role that it has shrewdly exploited to expand its political influence in the region .

karachi - starting this month ,  the state bank of pakistan  ( sbp )  will permit micro-finance banks  ( mfbs )  to provide mortgage loans to individuals ,  sbp chief spokesman syed wasimuddin said on august <num>30</num>  .
established in pakistan in <num>2002</num>  , mfbs were intended to achieve un millennium development goals aimed at alleviating poverty through socio-economic development . 
kashf is one of nine banks offering micro-loans . 
they want to reach the <num>10</num>  million households identified by the government and donor agencies as those who can most benefit from micro-finance support . 
according to him ,  about one million people have benefited from existing micro-finance services over the past seven years . 
the pakistani government ,  world bank ,  asian development bank and non-government organizations  ( ngos )  are all supporting mfbs to reduce poverty and promote socio-economic development ,  he added .

islamabad - the national tuberculosis control programme  ( ntcp )  provides <num>90</num>  percent of its treatment free of cost to poor patients ,  programme manager dr noor ahmed baloch said on august <num>31</num>  .
the government is striving to reach <num>100</num>  percent free treatment for tb patients ,  he asserted . 
tb is curable ;  all it needs is a complete treatment  [ effort ]  over an eight month period . 
according to the ntcp ,  <num>44</num>  percent of all tb patients in the eastern mediterranean region are in pakistan . 
who statistics indicate that the incidence of sputum-positive tb cases in pakistan is <num>80</num>  per <num>100,000</num>  each year . 
tb is responsible for <num>5.1</num>  percent of the total national disease burden in pakistan . 
baloch said that more than <num>5000</num>  health centres are already operating in <num>56</num>  districts ,  while rural health units  ( rhu )  are doing their best to deliver medical facilities to tb patients . 
because of the involvement of teachers ,  religious scholars ,  students and health workers on a larger scale ,  the government hopes it can achieve its target in tb reduction set under the millennium development goals-2015 . 
dr muhammad tariq ,  technical advisor to nctp said that the overall objective of the ntcp programme is to reduce mortality ,  morbidity and disease transmission so that tb is no longer a public health issue . 
kyrgyzstan recommends citizens not perform hajj to mecca this year
will the pandemic stop pilgrims from undertaking the hajj to mecca ? 
 ( photo by afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - the kyrgyz department of sanitary and epidemiological monitoring is recommending that citizens not undertake the hajj to mecca this year due to the h1n1 flu pandemic . 
it issued the recommendation after saudi authorities circulated new rules for undertaking a hajj in <num>2009</num>  .
the main requirement is that pilgims have in their possession an arabic-language document affirming that they have been vaccinated against seasonal flu or h1n1 at least two weeks before receiving an entry visa to the kingdom . 
if a person entering saudi arabia on a plane or bus is found to have flu symptoms ,  all the passengers in the vehicle will be refused entry . 
saudi authorities also recommended that national governments and hajj organisers hold special informational campaigns for pilgrims on precautionary and preventative measures against the h1n1 virus . 
last years kyrgyz hajj was nearly cancelled when several organisers raised the prices for transportation and lodging during the hajj . 
the average price for the <num>2008</num>  pilgrimage was <num>2,400</num>  $  per person . 
that price included transportation ,  lodging ,  food and the cost of a special visa . 
kyrgyz prisoners increasingly support hizb-ut-tahrir
penal colony convicts generally know nothing about islam other than what they learn from fellow muslim prisoners . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseldko / afp / getty images ) 
as for the activity of organisations deemed extremist ,  malikov said that they have survived the crisis and moved to a new level . 
in his view ,  hizb ut-tahrir has varied its strategy in response to local conditions . 
the party has stepped up its work through prisoners . 
according to information from various sources ,  the number of its supporters in prisons run by the main penal correction department of the ministry of justice has risen sharply ,  malikov said . 
prisoners who join cells of this party have virtually everything  [ hizb ut-tahrir ]  needs for ideological training . 
he believes the situations main danger … is the fact that convicts in penal colonies simply have no alternative information on islam . 
it is possible that many who have become party members in prisons could enlist as militants after leaving prison as a result of their ideological training and fanatical allegiance to the ideas of hizb ut-tahrir . 
he points out that the state has neither the money nor the capacity to separate people convicted of extremism from the rest of the prison population . 
dr malikov also warned that religious extremists are planting members of the hizb ut-tahrir party in government bodies ,  including security agencies .

more is spent on tax reports in one year than the government has spent in the last three years on cotton processing facilities . 
the book-keeping required by uzbekistans tax authorities consumes <num>0.7</num>  percent of the countrys gdp ,  notes vsevolod payevskiy ,  director of an ifc project to improve uzbekistans business environment . 
although keeping track of a companys indicators is essential ,  the uzbek process exacts a heavy toll from private enterprises . 
the ifc has prepared eleven recommendations for improving the uzbek tax code and has invited more than <num>500</num>  tax inspectors from seven of the country's regions to attend training sessions on current methods of processing company reports . 
house museum of father of tajik soviet literature may be demolished
dushanbe - the home of tajik writer sadriddin aini  ( <num>1878</num>  - <num>1954</num>  )  ,  one of the founding fathers of tajik soviet literature ,  a scholar and public figure ,  is in danger of being demolished in samarkand . 
under a verbal order by the uzbek government ,  the home that became a museum will be closed to visitors ,  and all exhibits as well as the authors personal belongings ,  books ,  and furniture will be removed from the building . 
a museum staffer said the museum had asked the authorities to preserve the historical site ,  but have received no response . 
so far ,  a bust of the writer that stood in the courtyard has been removed and the sign on the front of the building has been taken down . 
many believe this irresponsible move could hurt tajik-uzbek relations and cause unrest among tajiks livings in samarkand ,  bukhara and other regions of uzbekistan . 
samarkand activists are collecting signatures on a petition to president islam karimov to save the house museum . 
ainis most famous works include the short novel odina  ( <num>1924</num>  )  ,  dokhunda  ( <num>1927</num> -<num>1928</num>  )  and slaves  ( <num>1934</num>  )  ,  a trilogy about tajik peoples struggles over a century . 
aini published a commentary and historical essays during world war ii .

tajik president honoured by international road transport union
dushanbe - the international road transport union  ( iru )  praised tajikistans role in developing transit corridors and simplifying border crossings . 
on september <num>15</num>  , the organisation presented tajik president emomali rakhmon an award for his contribution to the development of cargo transit and reviving the great silk road . 
iru general secretary martin marmi said a long-term study of iru work in central asia has shown that tajikistan offers the easiest processing for transit cargo . 
due to the general lack of organisation in the region ,  up to <num>40</num>  percent of a drivers time en route is spent processing documents and passing border inspections ,  which has an impact both on product quality and price . 
the iru and tajik government have already signed a memorandum of cooperation to improve cargo transit in the country . 
so far ,  four of the ten agreements have been signed . 
president rakhmon suggested holding an international conference in dushanbe next year to develop central asian transport potential and open a regional iru office in tajikistan .

suppressed in soviet times ,  islam has been making a comeback in central asia following the regions independence almost two decades ago . 
 ( photo by uriel sinai / getty images ) 
uzbekistan - veritas ,  an uzbek human rights group for young people ,  opposed an unofficial ban on islamic headscarves in tashkents secondary schools on september <num>14</num>  .
while there has been no official declaration of the policy ,  human rights watchdog groups assert that school administrations have been actively discouraging young women from wearing headscarves . 
refusal to comply has resulted in ostracism and ridicule by teachers and school administrators . 
there have been many incidents where pupils wearing headscarves in the classroom are forced to stand for several hours in one place ,  the human rights report says . 
in many cases ,  school administrators publicly humiliate students wearing headscarves . 
there have been no systematic attempts to ban headscarves in schools of neighbouring countries ,  although some officials have made their opposition to the scarves clear . 
the kazakh ministry of justice ,  however ,  has ruled that women may pose for official document photos wearing headscarves . 
taliban suspected in pakistan school bombing
the destroyed school in the outskirts of peshawar ,  hours after the blast on <abbr>sept.</abbr> 
peshawar ,  pakistan - suspected taliban militants bombed a primary school on the outskirts of peshawar on september <num>22</num>  , underscoring the terrorist groups disregard for the taliban code of conduct issued in july that forbids attacks on civilians . 
the three-room school building was entirely destroyed in the blast ,  local police official hamzullah khan said . 
the nature of the blast shows that the taliban are behind the incident . 
there were no immediate reports of casualties because the school was closed for the muslim festival of eid al-fitr that marks the end of ramadan . 
gunmen have destroyed hundreds of schools since taliban and al-qaeda-linked extremists embarked on a concerted campaign of bombings two years ago ,  in which more than <num>2,000</num>  people have died . 
the pakistani army won back control of the north-western swat district following a summer offensive to defeat a two-year taliban uprising ,  when it became clear that islamist extremists posed an existential threat to pakistan . 
pakistan announced a series of high-profile arrests in swat ,  and this month mounted another offensive in the khyber district ,  the main supply line for nato forces in afghanistan on the edge of peshawar . 
the school bombing came as police confirmed they were investigating a possible assassination attempt on a provincial cabinet minister ,  after killing a teenage suicide bomber in totalai village in the north-western buner district . 
it was difficult to determine the militants objective ,  but provincial education minister sadar hussain babak ,  who frequently travels on the schools road ,  said he could have been the target .

natural gas supply to kyrgyzstan cut off again
the supply of natural gas to the kyrgyz city of osh has been completely cut off . 
the region owes uzbekistan us$2 million . 
 ( photo by sergei supinsky / afp / getty images ) 
the price of uzbek natural gas has risen by <num>95</num>  $  since last year ,  and now stands at <num>240</num>  $  per <num>1,000</num>  cubic metres . 
a few years ago ,  bishkek only had to pay <num>55</num>  $  .
in august ,  kyrgyzstan asked tashkent to lower the price of natural gas due to the fall in global prices of fossil fuels . 
uzbek authorities responded that they would cut the price by <num>20</num>  $  in the fourth quarter of this year ,  on the condition that the debt was repaid in full . 
the gas debt ,  however ,  does not concern tashkent as much as the issue of the sharing of water resources with kyrgyzstan . 
uzbekistan is openly opposed to the construction of hydroelectric power plants there ,  and believes they will reduce water availability for irrigation in the summer . 
the issues of water and fossil fuel supply are therefore regarded by both countries as being closely linked .

turkmenistan appoints new muslim spiritual leader
a local imam calls muslims to prayer from the minaret of a mosque in ashgabat . 
turkmenistan - turkmenistan has appointed a new mufti to head the official muslim spiritual council in the secular state . 
following a resolution by the members of the turkmen muslim association ,  g . 
khatylyev has been appointed mufti . 
he will reportedly combine this position with that of head imam of the mosque in the village of kipchak ,  located in the rukhabat district of akhal province . 
the turkmen mufti is also deputy chairman of the presidential religious affairs council ,  and is therefore a salaried government official ,  with all attendant rights and responsibilities . 
the new national muslim spiritual leader earlier served as chairman of a provincial religious affairs council . 
his predecessor rovshen allaberdiyev was appointed joint chairman of the religious affairs council in the dashoguz province and local imam under the same resolution . 
no official explanation was given for the new appointments in turkmenistans spiritual leadership ,  but sources say the head of state was not satisfied with the implementation of instructions he had given allaberdiyev in august to organise a pilgrimage to national sacred sites . 
in august <num>2007</num>  , president berdymukhammedov signed a decree pardoning the former first mufti of turkmenistan and ethnic uzbek nasrulla ibn ibadulla ,  who was convicted by the supreme court in march <num>2004</num>  of conspiracy to assassinate the countrys first president ,  saparmurad niyazov . 
international human rights organisations in turkmenistan say that the mufti was not connected to the attempt on niyazovs life in <num>2002</num>  , and that the charge was a convenient pretext to remove him from power and establish political motives for his actions .

according to the ministry of industry and trade ,  the agreements signed during the visit are worth us$6 billion . 
kyrgyzstan considers tough measures to combat drug dealing and crime
the head of the kyrgyz state national security committee believes that the measures he has proposed will soon yield results . 
 ( photo by maxim marmur / afp / getty images ) 
he said ,  we need to make it clear to drug barons - three or four in chui province ,  a few in bishkek and no more than ten in osh - that they are second-class citizens . 
they should be stripped of their right to vote and their citizenship ,  their children should be prevented from attending school ,  and they themselves should be moved into rural areas and barred from entering cities . 
should they get any closer than <num>50</num>  kilometer  ,  stringent measures should be taken ,  sutalinov said . 
he also proposed that people should be punished for aiding and abetting drug-related offences . 
if one person is using drugs and another person is aware of this ,  both should be punished ,  he argued . 
he proposed that the same principle should be applied to members of organised criminal gangs . 
sutalinov acknowledged this was not a new idea ,  and that he had not come up with anything particularly clever .

i started creating wire pieces six years ago in gujranwala . 
i now plan to open an art gallery and training centre at skardu to renew education in the art form . 
she said i was moved by the different shapes of trees ,  which symbolise beauty that is born out of differences and hardships . 
being inspired from nature and focused on the gifts of nature ,  i chose to create miniature models of plants and trees by assembling refined metal wires with stones ,  beads ,  clay ,  broken mirror pieces and various metal objects . 
an artist taps into the soul of nature ,  channeling its spirit through his or her hands to create art ,  said ambreen ,  a visitor and miniature artist .

pakistan shocked by irans allegation
karachi - pakistani politicians and analysts were shocked by irans allegation that pakistan sponsored an attack on iranian revolutionary guard members in the sistan-baluchistan area ,  which killed more than <num>40</num>  people on <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
the banned religious organisation jundullah that claimed responsibility for the suicide attack conducted a number of terror attacks in pakistan in the past . 
naeem ,  who is conducting research on religious terrorism in the country ,  said the diplomatic and political relationship between pakistan and iran turned sour when the taliban formed their government in afghanistan . 
iran rejected the talibans government ,  while pakistan cooperated with it for a time ,  he added . 
he said pakistan opposed violence by non-state actors and iranian officials should not hold the government responsible for any terror attack . 
instead of leveling serious allegations ,  iran should work jointly with pakistan to eliminate terrorism ,  marri added . 
security analyst says pakistan requires internal discourse to develop alternatives to extremism
lahore - pakistan needs an internal discourse ,  without which it cannot counter extremism or terrorism at the state and societal level ,  according to leading independent security analyst and strategic affairs expert dr ayesha siddiqa agha . 
the south asian region currently faces grave security threats due to increasing extremism and terrorist activities within its states . 
the politics of violence can be linked to the contradictions arising out of flawed national policies ,  she said . 
religious extremism is a global issue ,  but in south asia ,  pakistan is the nation worst affected by it . 
extremism and terrorism are interlinked and the contributing factors of bad governance and ideology make extremism more threatening in pakistan . 
a counter-terrorism strategy cannot be developed without considering counter-extremism at the same time ,  agha said . 
she called for internal discourse within the muslim world to provide alternatives to extremism and suggested that one would require an overhaul of government policies to generate political stability . 
the factors that have generated social ,  economic and political instability in pakistan suggest that there are no quick fixes available and that turning things around will only be achieved by measures implemented over the long term ,  she said . 
that would go a long way to reducing their potential for recruiting young people into violent extremist organisations . 
she also pointed out a dire need to create an even more specialised anti-terrorism force and suggested that the army's special services group  ( ssg )  be converted into a force solely dedicated to counter-terrorism .

ahmadinejad speaks prior to nuclear decision
he said the provision of fuel for a tehran research reactor was an opportunity for iran to evaluate the honesty of world powers and the uns international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  . 
 " fortunately ,  conditions have been prepared for international cooperation in the nuclear field ,  "  he said . 
 " we welcome cooperation on nuclear fuel ,  power plants and technology and we are ready to cooperate .  " 
a draft nuclear fuel deal was hammered out by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei in follow-up talks to an <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
<num>1</num>  meeting between iran and the six world powers in geneva ,  where iran also agreed to open a new enrichment site for un inspections . 
the plan calls for iran to transfer about <num>75</num>  percent of its known <num>1.5</num>  tonnes of leu to russia for further enrichment by the end of this year ,  and then to france for conversion into fuel plates . 
these would be returned to tehran to power the reactor ,  which produces radioisotopes for cancer treatment . 
ahmadinejad said iran expected the world nations to fulfill their commitments and keep their promises .

iran responds on uranium enrichment ,  seeks changes
one week after the deadline ,  the international atomic energy agency received tehrans official response to the international proposal allowing it to transfer its uranium enrichment programme abroad . 
in reaction to irans late response ,  french foreign minister bernard kouchner warned that the country was risking stiffer international penalties if it attempted to abort the vienna agreement . 
european union foreign policy liaison officer javier solana was quoted as saying that there was nothing in the draft that would warrant any fundamental modification . 
iranian sources ,  however ,  predicted that while tehran may agree in principle to the framework drawn up during the negotiations ,  its response will include amendments relating to the quantities of uranium to be enriched abroad and the mechanism for its delivery . 
the vienna draft stipulates that iran should deliver <num>1,200</num>  kilogram  of five percent uranium ,  lightly enriched at the natanz facility ,  to russia for further enrichment to a concentration of <num>19.75</num>  percent by the end of the year ,  before france converts it into nuclear fuel rods . 
the rods will then be used to power the research facility in tehran built by argentinean experts using french technology . 
it seems ,  however ,  that iran has not agreed to deliver such a large amount ,  and is currently asserting that the total quantity of low-grade uranium in its possession is <num>1,500</num>  kilogram  . 
analysts views reflect the positions being taken by senior iranian officials . 
mohsen rezai ,  chairman of the expediency discernment council ,  estimates that his country has only <num>1,100</num>  kilogram  of enriched uranium ,  while alaeddin boroujerdi ,  who chairs the foreign policy committee in the iranian consultative assembly ,  notes that iran receives quantities of uranium by instalment only . 
the problem of uranium enrichment is at the heart of the iranian nuclear issue . 
lightly enriched uranium is used in civilian nuclear reactors ,  while highly enriched uranium ,  which can reach a concentration of up to <num>90</num>  percent ,  can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons .

she recently returned to bishkek and dropped some of the accusations . 
maksim bakiyev denies the charges . 
kyrgyz political observers have grown sceptical of the presidents commitment to implement the substantial structural change in the government that he promised earlier ,  and say he is only increasing the power his office holds .

phase-i of the project has already extended us$47 million in credit to <num>13,000</num>  farmers . 
the project will ensure easy access to credit in under-served areas in pakistan  [ and will ]  ultimately enhance agricultural production and earnings ,  said hamid malhi ,  president of the zarai insaf board . 
he added that it was a good development that the sbp and local banks were focusing on the well-being of farmers and the development of agriculture ,  on which <num>70</num>  percent of pakistans population still depends for its livelihood . 
to ensure the success of its endeavour ,  the sbp and domestic banks should ensure the disbursement of credit among farmers on a fast-track basis at a concessional interest rate ,  said abdul majid nizamani ,  a farmer in sindh . 
as the backbone of the pakistani economy ,  agriculture should be given maximum incentives ,  he contended .

state bank of pakistan lists major challenges for economy
karachi stock exchange traders watch market activity on computer screens at their booths on the trading floor . 
the government has ,  however ,  reduced the current deficit and inflation ,  and also enhanced foreign exchange reserves in the first four months of fy2010 ,  said sbp finance chief shaukat tarin . 
he also noted that efforts were underway to enhance tax revenue and maintain the deficit and inflation within specific limits . 
increased international support ,  an increase in imf credit ,  and donors commitment to enhance lending in fy2010 put the economy on the path of gradual recovery and revived investor confidence ,  he added . 
the government is also paying close attention to agriculture and increased crop production to achieve economic growth ,  said tarin . 
according to the sbp report ,  a gradual recovery is underway for fy2010 ,  and real gdp growth is likely to be close to the target of <num>3.3</num>  percent for the year . 
the report said signs of recovery included an increase in imports during july <num>2009</num>  , pointing to a possible recovery in domestic demand ;  a decline in large-scale manufacturing  ( lsm )  growth ,  limited to <num>4.4</num>  percent and a resolution of circular debt problems supporting production levels of oil and energy . 
army control of sararogha is one of the major achievements of ongoing military operations against the taliban ,  he said . 
government forces earlier took control of two other taliban strongholds ,  karama and kanigurram . 
the army made clear ahead of its operation that it was launched only against militants in waziristan and not against the mehsud tribes there ,  he explained . 
abbas said before the ground assault that the aerial bombing by the pakistan air force  ( paf )  and drone attacks in waziristan had destroyed the communications system and network of the taliban in the region . 
looking ahead ,  abbas said ,  ladha and makeen are the next key targets of the military operation . 
he added ,  the taliban headquarters are in makeen ,  and the army could face tough resistance there ,  but it is determined to eliminate the taliban from south waziristan by mid-december . 
guerilla war is expected in the surroundings of makeen ,  said shamim shahid ,  a peshawar-based security analyst .

the two-day conference was organised jointly by the federal criminal police office of germany and a number of tajik security agencies . 
kahhorov said the arrest of individuals suspected of terrorism and crimes against the constitutional order is often blocked when they are been granted asylum in other states . 
he called on neighbouring countries to comply with the principles underpinning the un security council resolution on the matter and refuse asylum to those suspected of such offences . 
he also proposed that information on the movements of criminal gang members within central asia be shared . 
the president of the federal criminal police office of germany ,  jorg ziercke ,  said that illegal drug dealing cannot be tackled effectively unless stability is achieved in afghanistan . 
he claimed that more than <num>12,000</num>  tonnes of drugs are being stored in warehouses in afghanistan . 
he proposed that alliances to combat drugs and crime be created in the region and that financial assistance be granted to countries within the region to support such projects . 
the afghan deputy internal affairs minister ,  mohammad dovud ,  stated that drug production was cut by <num>22</num>  percent in <num>2009</num>  thanks to the efforts of law enforcement agencies . 
he believes that countries in the region need to step up cooperation on border monitoring . 
psychological support for trauma victims
islamabad - pakistan institute of medical sciences  ( pims )  executive director dr altaf hussain said the organisation directed a team of psychiatrists to provide psychological support to trauma victims on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>6</num>  .
pims will draw on the extensive experience its psychiatry department has had in dealing with earthquake victims and internally displaced persons  ( idps )  . 
the directive was issued in the wake of a different set of reoccurring traumatising events ,  hussain said . 
the current spate of suicide bombings has prompted pims to make arrangements to ensure the availability of mental health professionals to  [ treat ]  trauma victims . 
mohammad ijaz ,  <num>24</num>  , who suffered injuries from the recent rawalpindi bank blast ,  described the incident as horrible . 
recalling scenes of the destruction ,  he said he had only gone to the bank to draw his salary . 
i was talking to a bank guard when the explosion shook the building . 
i saw dead bodies ,  pools of blood and body parts . 
it looked as if all hell had broken loose . 
approximately <num>300</num>  doctors ,  nurses ,  paramedics ,  dressers and housekeeping staff members have already received specific training in counseling victims of violent trauma . 
similar courses are being prepared for hospitals in rawalpindi and islamabad . 
we must let them speak ,  and we must listen . 
imf :  tajikistan performed well during crisis
a market in gissar ,  near dushanbe . 
the imf foresees a rise in poverty as real income declines in the wake of the global financial crisis . 
they noted that despite reduced exports of the countrys main export goods ,  aluminium and cotton ,  the tajik economy is performing well during the global financial crisis . 
according to septembers statistics ,  yearly economic growth in the country was at nearly three percent . 
schimmelpfennig and moers believe that this relative success was the result of two factors . 
first ,  the government ,  with the help of donors ,  quickly reacted to external economic shocks ,  and put into action a tax / budget stimulus amounting to <num>1.5</num>  percent of the gdp for <num>2009</num>  , which centred on raising social expenditure ,  the economists said . 
second ,  the reduction in real income was mainly expressed in a reduction in imports that grew more expensive due to the weakening of the somoni  ( tajik currency )  in reaction to the crisis . 
still ,  according to the fund officials ,  the global crisis continues to negatively affect the tajik economy . 
in particular ,  recent successes in reducing poverty may be partially reversed ,  as it appears that real income this year will fall by eight percent . 
a healthy private sector that can generate internal demand and produce items for export ,  should become the driving force of tajik economic growth ,  they said . 
in recent years ,  however ,  the mean figure for private investments in tajikistan only averaged between four and seven percent of the gdp ,  one of the lowest levels of gdp investment in the world . 
according to schimmelpfennig and moers ,  economic reforms in the country should focus on improving the business environment and investment climate ,  as well as the development of the necessary infrastructure ,  including the provision of a reliable and inexpensive power supply . 
tripoli ,  libya - in what may prove one of the biggest breakthroughs against islamist terrorism since <num>9</num>  / <num>11</num>  , the libyan islamic fighting group  ( lifg )  ,  a militant libyan jihadist group ,  once allied with osama bin laden ,  is publicly repudiating al-qaedas ideology . 
many expect the breakthrough talks to have an impact far beyond libya . 
government condemnations  [ of violent extremism ]  do not have the same impact as condemnations from the leaders of a terrorist group . 
jihadi leaders condemning violence have more credibility in terror circles ,  saif al islam gadhafi told cnn . 
noman benotman ,  a key intermediary in the talks between lifg and the libyan government ,  told cnn that the groups revisions will be a very big shock to al-qaeda . 
libyan officials hope that the new lifg jihadi code ,  a <num>417</num> -page religious document entitled corrective studies that is the result of more than two years of intense and secret talks between the leaders of the lifg and libyan security officials ,  will have an impact in curbing violence . 
in the last two years ,  libyan security services have grown increasingly concerned about the rising number of attacks launched across the region by al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb  ( aqim )  . 
they have also become concerned about the number of libyans travelling to algeria to join the group . 
libyan sources told cnn that ,  while it is still early in the day ,  the document may already have had an impact in algeria ,  as attacks are down since the code was published .

 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ) 
dushanbe - tajik authorities have launched a large-scale initiative to cancel debts of cotton farmers ,  amounting to nearly us$550 million . 
the debts were incurred between <num>1997</num>  and the beginning of <num>2008</num>  , when farmers borrowed funds from investment brokers in exchange for future harvests . 
year after year ,  having failed to pay off their existing debts ,  farmers had to take out new loans . 
the interest rates rose ,  and thats how these astronomical debts mounted up ,  explained finance expert firuz sanginov . 
according to nematjon buriyev ,  the senior economic policy advisor to the president and the head of a working group responsible for monitoring cotton debt repayments ,  the write-offs are an important milestone . 
now without their debt burdens ,  farmers will feel that they are the true owners of their land and will be able to decide independently to sow ,  who to sell to and what prices to charge ,  he asserted . 
farmers ,  too ,  are in a businesslike mood . 
manager of the firuz farm in bokhtar province subkhon sharapov owed <num>91,000</num>  $  to lenders ,  but could not pay off his debt . 
he was also voluntarily-compulsorily forced to sow <num>60</num>  percent of his irrigated land to cotton . 
cotton is not a profitable crop . 
its better to grow wheat and vegetables ,  sharapov believes .

 ( photo by maxim marmur / afp / getty images ) 
dushanbe - the osce office in dushanbe has presented a plan to reform and develop tajikistans law enforcement agencies over the next five years . 
under the plan ,  tajikistan will have to amend laws to alter the structure of the interior ministry and step up its activity in the fight against human trafficking ,  gender-related violence and other crimes . 
an estimated us$2 . 5 million in investment is required to implement the project . 
head of the osce office in dushanbe ivar viki noted the importance of joint efforts to fight organised crime and violent extremism in his opening address at the seminar . 
we must work to implement measures aimed at expanding the mandate of law enforcement agencies ,  improving the qualifications of their employees and creating structures that can respond to criminal conditions . 
it is important to strengthen relations between the public and the police ,  and to set the stage for the successful reform of law enforcement agencies ,  he said . 
cooperation between the government and the osce to reform law enforcement agencies was approved in late <num>2007</num>  , when the interior ministry received technical support from advisors at the osce secretariat in vienna on combating violent extremism . 
independent consultants followed up over the past <num>18</num>  months with assessments of the needs of tajikistans interior ministry .

experts at the institute of seismology predict how the earths crust will behave both in the near future and in the long term . 
those in charge of the committee believe this information should be screened by civil servants before being made public . 
more than three million people ,  or <num>63</num>  percent of the countrys population ,  live in areas where earthquakes measuring <num>9.0</num>  on the richter scale are possible . 
the homes they live in ,  and those built prior to the <num>1990</num>  second  in particular ,  do not meet earthquake safety requirements . 
specialists from environmental organisations opined ,  however ,  that all decisions in this area should take into account the views of all parties involved in earthquake forecasting ,  which did not happen in this case . 
uzbek rocket fuel to be made safe by nato experts
after the dissolution of the soviet union ,  its former republics inherited a number of local soviet military facilities . 
the initiative is the most high-tech project to be implemented in uzbekistan under natos partnership for peace programme . 
at the end of the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  uzbek troops participated in nato exercises in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and germany ,  and joint centrazbat and nato exercises were conducted in uzbekistan . 
after the events of <num>2005</num>  in andijan ,  however ,  when the government brutally repressed a public demonstration ,  joint cooperation efforts were scaled down . 
joint cooperation is now being renewed in the field of ecology ,  which is important for all of humanity ,  de wispelaere commented . 
uzbekistan withdraws from united energy system
until recently ,  four former soviet republics in central asia were part of the ucaes . 
turkmenistan withdrew in <num>2003</num>  .
the uzbek ministry of foreign affairs said tashkent provided official notice in september and october to all parties concerned that it would pull out of the united energy system on <abbr>dec.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
observers relate that when uzbekistan announced its intention to withdraw from the ucaes ,  some officials claimed the country would not really take the step and instead wanted to charge a fee for the transfer of electricity via its national grid . 
uzbek ambassador to tajikistan shokasym shoislamo revealed that kazakhstan also plans to pull out of the ucaes as soon as it fills gaps in its own power grid .

rawalpindi ,  pakistan - militants stormed a mosque near pakistan's army headquarters in rawalpindi killing <num>40</num>   ( including <num>17</num>  children )  during friday prayers as they sprayed gunfire and threw grenades before blowing themselves up . 
it was the latest in a wave of strikes by suspected islamist insurgents that has killed more than <num>400</num>  people in pakistan since october . 
a military statement said four attackers hurled grenades ,  and then opened fire as they rushed toward the mosque on parade lane in a military residential complex just a few miles from the capital .

 " they were killing people like animals ,  "  he said . 
 " i couldn't understand what was happening .  " 
the army said authorities were investigating how the attackers penetrated the security ring surrounding the area . 
according to city residents ,  access to the mosque was mostly restricted to the families of military personnel living there . 
it was the second attack against a military installation this week .

the agreement will come into effect on july <num>1</num>  , <num>2010</num>  and the unions member states have already indicated that several other countries will join in the near future . 
the kazakh president spoke of the benefits that the customs union would bring to each of its members . 
he estimates that it will enable russia to increase its customs revenues by up to us$400 billion ,  while belarus and kazakhstan stand to earn an additional <num>16</num>  $  billion or so each . 
the customs union will form the basis for the creation of a single economic region ,  the kazakh leader asserts . 
the legal framework for this area should be completed by <num>2011</num>  .
nazarbayev believes that the creation of the customs union will enable its member states to boost their gdp by <num>15</num>  percent  [ annually ]  by <num>2015</num>  .
the president of belarus ,  aleksandr lukashenko ,  said that belarus had become a venue for momentous decisions ever since the day in <num>1991</num>  when the dissolution of the soviet union was announced in the belavezha forest . 
president medvedev commented that unlike the events of <num>18</num>  years ago ,  things were now moving in the opposite direction .

the kyrgyz man first came to the attention of the police on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
<num>30</num>  , when he showed his documents at a checkpoint while leaving makhachkala ,  the capital of dagestan . 
he had a kyrgyz passport and his documents were in order ,  but the taxi driver said that his passenger was going outside the city ,  to the edge of a forest . 
the documents found on the dead man indicated that he was beksultan karibekov ,  a kyrgyz national born in <num>1982</num>  .
kyrgyzstans ambassador to russia ,  raimkul attokurov ,  said we are trying to establish the nationality of the dead man and whether or not he was holding the kyrgyz passport found on him legally . 
there have already been several instances of citizens of central asian republics found to have links with fundamentalists in the caucasus ,  led by the emir of the caucasus doku umarov . 
an uzbek national was one of those killed . 
five kazakh nationals were killed in july in a shoot-out between a special russian federal security service task force and militants in a forest on the outskirts of makhachkala . 
three local extremists were also killed . 
kyrgyzstan on the brink of energy crisis
kyrgyzstan prime minister igor chudinov ordered the continuation of negotiations on importing electricity supplies this winter . 
 ( getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan is on the brink of a hydroelectricity crisis ,  saparbek balkibekov ,  minister of industry ,  energy and fuel resources ,  said july <num>31</num>  at a meeting of government ministers . 
minister balkibekov explained that the country was encountering a drought period ,  as a result of which water levels at the toktogul reservoir ,  the largest in the central asian region ,  had dropped sharply . 
thus ,  according to official statistics ,  hydroelectricity resources at the reservoirs in the syrdar and amudar river basins are <num>8.3</num>  billion cubic metres less this year than they were last year . 
the actual flow of water into the toktogul reservoir between april and june this year came to <num>4.2</num>  billion cubic metres ,  or <num>85</num>  percent of <num>2007</num>  levels . 
outflow has been <num>1.9</num>  billion cubic metres . 
water volumes in the reservoir are currently only <num>9.1</num>  billion cubic metres ,  which is exactly one billion cubic metres below what was anticipated . 
without the adoption of additional measures to save water and rationalise the use of water resources ,  water reserves in the coming autumn / winter period will be reduced to as low as the dead point of <num>5.5</num>  billion cubic metres by next january ,  the minister emphasised . 
in these circumstances the turbines at the toktogul hydroelectric power station ,  which produces up to <num>50</num>  percent of all kyrgyzstans hydroelectricity ,  will shut down automatically . 
the minister noted that in order for water volumes in the toktogul reservoir not to fall below <num>6.1</num>  billion cubic metres before april <num>2009</num>  and for the toktogul hydroelectric power station to continue operating at at least <num>600</num>  mw ,  it is essential that electricity production and usage be reduced between august <num>2008</num>  and march <num>2009</num>  .
the volume of reduction required is at least <num>2.6</num>  billion kwh . 
for the first half of <num>2008</num>  , hydroelectricity production in the country came to <num>6.7</num>  billion kwh ,  which is <num>829</num>  billion kwh less than over the same period the previous year . 
bishkeks combined heat and power stations were operating at <num>40</num>  mw throughout may and june ,  or <num>22</num>  percent of anticipated capacity ,  thanks to lack of funding for fuel and a reduction in natural gas supplies . 
shanghai cooperation organisation member nations deepen ties for continuing partnership
building on and strengthening partnerships established in security and defence ,  the member nations of the shanghai cooperation organisation  ( sco )  are also turning to foreign policy and trade as areas of overlapping mutual interest . 
this conclusion was provided by tajikistan minister of foreign affairs khamrokhon zarifi . 
a general layout is prepared for last years sco meeting . 
 ( getty images ) 
according to zarifi ,  the step-by-step implementation of the organisations agreement ,  the treaty of good-neighbourliness and friendly cooperation ,  will promote deepening trust among sco countries and provide opportunities for a full spectrum of mutual assistance among its member nations . 
on june <num>25</num>  , the capital of tajikistan ,  dushanbe ,  was host to the latest round of talks between the heads of the foreign affairs ministries of the respective sco member nations  ( china ,  russia ,  kazakhstan ,  uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzstan and tajikistan )  . 
the head diplomats from these six countries discussed issues relating to the upcoming meeting planned for sco nations heads of state ,  who will be invited to tajikistan for the aug <num>28</num>  event . 
afghanistans current situation received the full attention of the sco ministers during the meeting ,  according to zarifi . 
despite its recent appearance on the world stage the sco has seen rapid development ,  according to independent economic expert rustam dzhabarov ,  who points to the organisations effectiveness in increasing economic cooperation among its members . 
the sco facilitates economic development and is capable of averting potential crises ,  such as food shortages ,  through member nations natural resources ,  human reserves and pooled capital and experience ,  commented the expert . 
three investment projects in tajikistan were approved for funding through long-term favourable loans totalling <num>603.5</num>  $  million . 
during the first half of <num>2008</num>  , approximately <num>350</num>  $  million of the chinese credit was spent on development projects ,  according to timurali afgonov ,  head of the federal administration for government debt and financial assets in tajikistan's ministry of finance . 
by the close of <num>2009</num>  , the full amount of the <num>603.5</num>  $  million credit line will be spent in accordance with agreements signed by china and tajikistan . 
according to dzhura boboyev ,  head of tajikglavenergo's construction division ,  the completed construction of high-voltage power lines will allow greater sco cooperation on energy issues . 
these electrical transmission lines will deliver high volumes of uninterrupted electrical power year-round to sco members and afghanistan . 
jump-starting economic cooperation between organisation members will allow constituent nations to find solutions for such pressing issues as employment ,  poverty ,  increasing volume of trade and attracting outside investment ,  according to analysts . 
today it is generally recognised that the wild siversa apple ,  which grows in the zailiysk and dzhungarsk alatau mountains in kazakhstan ,  is the earliest ancestor of the modern varieties of this fruit . 
the genetic uniqueness of kazakhstans apple forests and the importance of its gene pool are recognised around the world . 
the apple-growing industry in the world is now experiencing great difficulties in connection with the declining quality of the cultivated varieties . 
along these lines ,  the experts believe that the only solution is to support the cultivated varieties with components from the population of wild apples in kazakhstan . 
however ,  the fruit trees in the republic ,  which are a strategic gene pool of world importance ,  are now in urgent need of being saved because for many years they have been subject to anthropogenic influences . 
in the last <num>50</num>  years alone the area of the fruit tree forest has shrunk <num>70</num>  percent . 
this has happened for many reasons . 
the most serious threats include the uncontrolled use of the territory of the fruit tree forests for pasturing cattle ,  for smallholdings ,  and for gathering timber . 
moreover ,  in the region where the wild apple trees grow there is intensive building of various structures . 
as a result ,  the natural renewal of the fruit tree forests is deteriorating and their area is shrinking . 
the price of all the structures being built today on the area where the wild apple trees grow-houses ,  cottages-is nothing compared with the value of the gene pool on which the state can and must work ,  rodionov said . 
the uncontrolled pasturing of cattle is destroying the young apple trees and thus interfering with the natural reproduction of the plants . 
in addition ,  the local inhabitants often burn down unique trees in order to free up land for agriculture . 
the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  project conserving mountain agricultural and biological diversity in kazakhstan ,  which is being pursued along two lines ,  should help to solve many problems . 
the siversa apple tree in blossom
the first is the work with the local population living in areas where the wild siversa apple trees grow . 
experts on the project are conducting training seminars to provide some idea of the value of the fruit tree forests and the need for their strategic conservation . 
in addition ,  the idea of developing alternative kinds of economic activity for the local population is being discussed . 
as a result ,  the pressure on the fruit tree forest is being eased ,  and additional possibilities are emerging ,  such as employment opportunities for the local population which provide a stable income . 
local inhabitants have a lesson
in the opinion of the experts ,  it is difficult to overestimate the importance of the siversa wild apple .

during uzbekistan president islam karimovs official visit to the <abbr>u.a.e.</abbr>  in march ,  ipic and uzbekneftegaz signed a memorandum of cooperation in the oil and gas sector . 
two areas for collaboration were outlined in this document :  geological prospecting on the territory of uzbekistan ,  and identifying potential sites for joint operations in synthetic liquid fuel and petrochemical production . 
this project for producing synthetic fuel at the planned ustyurt petrochemical complex facilities is estimated to cost <num>1.1</num>  $  billion  [ usd ]  . 
the planned facilities will be able to convert <num>3.4</num>  billion cubic metres of gas and produce <num>1.7</num>  million tons of liquid fuel annually . 
the project is scheduled to be completed over the period <num>2009</num> -<num>2012</num>  .

uzbek parliament's senate has adopted amendments to the country's criminal code that tighten restrictions on foreigners' stays in the republic . 
a decree on amending restrictions for the stays of foreigners and non-citizens in the republic of uzbekistan was signed in may <num>2008</num>  by prime minister shavkat mirziyayev . 
in accordance with the changes adopted by the parliament ,  all foreign citizens found in violation of local laws may be deported from uzbekistan . 
for example ,  the new rules require deportation of foreigners found to be in violation of the terms of their stay ,  like residing in uzbekistan without a residency permit or on expired papers . 
the same penalty is applied in cases where proper procedures are not followed for temporary or permanent registration ;  for moving from a registered address or choosing another one ;  for overstaying legal time limits in the country ;  or for violating traffic regulations . 
previously ,  the above violations resulted only in fines . 
the government press centre issued a statement that noted ,  in part :   " these amendments to the criminal code will spur our effectiveness in combating illegal immigration and help to increase the accountability of foreigners and non-citizens for observing the terms of their stay in the republic of uzbekistan .  " 
secondly ,  we have never abused our right of deportation and do not intend to do so . 
these amendments are meant as a wake-up call for certain unmindful foreigners .  " 
currently ,  uzbekistan participates in a visa-free zone with nine other countries ,  among which are russia ,  kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan ;  an expedited visa agreement exists with twelve other nations . 
citizens of countries not included in the above categories are required to pay between <num>20</num>  $ -<num>250</num>  $   [ usd ]  ,  depending on the length and type of visa ,  in order to visit uzbekistan .

president nazarbayev of kazakhstan said that emissions of greenhouse gases in his country ,  which has ratified the kyoto protocol ,  will have to be cut by <num>25</num>  percent by <num>2020</num>  and a further <num>25</num>  percent by <num>2050</num>  .
levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the region are not particularly high ,  however . 
the most pressing problem facing the former soviet republics is the shortage of water resources . 
glacial melting in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan poses a serious environmental threat to the region . 
kyrgyzstans second national report to the un framework convention on climate change stated that the volume of its glaciers had diminished by <num>15</num>  percent over the past <num>30</num>  to <num>40</num>  years . 
one of the most acute problems in the region requiring urgent action is the fact that <num>60</num>  percent of the aral sea has evaporated . 
millions of uzbek ,  kazakh and turkmen citizens live in the risk zone . 
the president of kazakhstan stated in april that his country had spent about us$2 billion on efforts to save the aral sea . 
before it began shrinking ,  the aral sea was the worlds fourth-largest salt-water lake ,  but scientists now believe it cannot be saved . 
central asian ecologists are hoping that the summit will lay the foundations for international and regional policy on climate change through <num>2050</num>  and come to an agreement under which the countries of the region will pool their efforts to pursue their own interests and resolve their economic problems . 
uzbekistan headed to <num>2011</num>  asian cup final

the first goal was scored in the second half with server jeparov scoring in the 46t minute . 
the second and third goals were by aleksandr heinrich ,  who last week was eliminated as a contender for asian football confederation  ( afc )  player of the year . 
the afc clearly acted too soon ,  uzbek trainer mirzhalol kasimov said after the match . 
after taking a penalty shot from the left side ,  malaysian footballer mukhammad zakuan headed the ball into the goal . 
the malaysians could do no more ,  however . 
at the post-match press conference ,  the uzbek and malaysian coaches agreed that the fate of the elimination game for the <num>2011</num>  asian cup was the replacement of aziz ibragimov by aleksandr heinrich . 
the results of the return match ,  however ,  will not affect the uzbek teams position in group c ,  as it already has six points . 
palaces for the servants of the people ,  slums for the people
please take a look at the photos of a once famous tuberculosis treatment centre red october in tashkent . 
it provided tb treatment until uzbekistan gained its independence ,  and what is left of it still does . 
the centre is now under the 2nd hospital . 
but what about us ? 
how are we tackling the problem ? 
so far only <num>22</num>  percent of the amount allocated has been released to combat the disease . 
submitted by our reader
but the problem cannot be blamed on expenses for the 2200t anniversary of tashkent alone . 
the process of dilapidation has been going on for about <num>20</num>  years . 
in most cases ,  patients now have to buy their own drugs ,  but not all can afford to do so . 
lets not forget that officially the treatment of tb is free . 
patients who have not been treated adequately or who have not completed their treatment ,  however ,  evolve into chronic sufferers . 
in soviet times ,  the buildings in the photos were overflowing with patients . 
where are they now ? 
with a large number of prisoners and ex-convicts and migrant workers in our free uzbekistan ,  and with working conditions excellent for tb infection ,  the number of tb cases has probably increased and a number of tb sufferers live among us ,  unintentionally spreading the infection rather than being treated properly . 
the government has found a quick-fix solution . 
it has abolished routine fluorography medical examination aimed at early detection of tb ,  now patients must  [ pay for ]  fluorography and all other needed examinations . 
tb dispensaries now have the instructions to not report cases and to accept patients only when they show obvious symptoms such as bloody sputum ,  or sputum positive for koch bacillus . 
submitted by our reader
have authorities chosen to ignore the consequences of inadequate tuberculosis treatment in the country ? 
what lacks is government commitment to provide the resources necessary to combat the problem completely . 
i have also sent this message to the president of uzbekistan ,  the ministry of health and other appropriate institutions in anticipation of the 2200t anniversary of tashkent ,  since the above hospital is also part of tashkent . 
a review of the history of afghanistan reminds us of war . 
unfortunately ,  it was mostly young people who fell victim to them . 
afghanistan has suffered from many physical and emotional damages ,  and has lost many of its human resources over the years . 
because most of governmental and non-governmental organisations do not work for youth ,  i implore officials of responsible organisations to work for the young generation of afghanistan and provide them proper education . 
with education ,  rules will once again trump connections ,  and we will have the prospects for a successful future in our country .

construction will soon begin on a new road connecting afghanistan and pakistan

a new road is about to be constructed through the heart of the turbulent afghanistan-pakistan border region . 
the road ,  crossing over the nawa pass ,  will connect kunar to pakistan and may become a crucial border crossing for trade and commerce . 
in this strategically critical area ,  support from the local population is essential . 
more than <num>60</num>  elders from sarkani district gathered recently to discuss the road . 
the new road will be <num>12.7</num>  km long from sarkani to the border crossing point at about <num>6,000</num>  feet . 
a local company won the contract and will start the work within <num>10</num>  days . 
it will also bring jobs for an estimated <num>70</num>  local workers . 
all of the problems you see here happen because people do not have work ,  said hajji karimzai ,  an elder from sarkani . 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  provincial reconstruction team  ( prt )  ,  which is funding the project at a cost of <num>3.29</num>  $  million ,  requires contractors to hire <num>75</num>  percent of their labour force from within <num>10</num>  km of the construction site . 
members of the prt came to sarkani today to meet with local elders and ensure the project will have their support . 
the prts mission is different ,  said captain roman skaskiw . 
it is to create economic prosperity ,  and to work through the local government ,  security forces ,  and elders of this area . 
mawlavi rahimullah is the head of the ulema ,  or religious council ,  in sarkani . 
local people are going to support this project ,  he said . 
they know government projects are very beneficial for them . 
but on the other hand ,  these people are unarmed and if the taliban want to create problems and pressure them ,  definitely they will face problems because they have nothing to defend themselves with . 
taliban sometimes enter villages at night and intimidate the population in sarkani . 
the afghan national army  ( ana )  base at the foot of the pass receives rockets from the hills every week . 
and in may ,  five afghan border police  ( abp )  were killed and another <num>10</num>  wounded in a skirmish with militants at the border . 
commander ishaq of the ana and commander esmatullah safi of the abp sat with the elders and pledged to provide security for the project . 
their <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  marine corps advisors also came to show their support . 
but district governor gujarwal khan believes the economic benefits on both sides of the border are enough to ensure the project succeeds . 
the project is scheduled to be completed by may <num>2009</num>  .
youth council aims to promote peaceful discussion between afghanistan and pakistan
a pakistan-afghanistan youth council  ( payc )  has recently been launched to promote peaceful discussion between the neighbouring countries . 
as violence continues to escalate ,  both pakistanis and afghans are suffering . 
the number of civilian casualties continues to rise on both sides of the border .

payc aims to promote dialogue between the two countries . 
mehboobullah altaf ,  who lost his leg in a mine blast in afghanistan ,  is a key supporter of the youth council . 
he believes that in order for the two countries to combat their problems effectively ,  they need to come together . 
both countries share a common religion ,  culture and tradition ,  but still there is mistrust between them . 
these commonalities can help bring the two nations closer ,  he said . 
there is a growing misunderstanding between pakistan and afghanistan and we need to work together in order to help bring war and militancy in the region to an end ,  he added . 
the youth council was set up with the help of the non-governmental organisation sustainable peace and development organisation  ( spado )  . 
the organisation believes that youth can play a key role in helping to better unite the two countries . 
pakistan ambassador to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  husain haqqani said that pakistans new government has established a good relationship with afghan president hamid karzai ,  and initiatives such as payc will take a high priority . 
spado executive director raza shah khan said ,  the payc objective is to build confidence between the two neighbouring countries and their youth . 
this is the first time such an initiative has come about . 
he also said that there is a lack of civil society involvement between pakistan and afghanistan . 
attiqur rehman ,  a pakistani member of payc ,  said ,  establishing the council is a right step towards building trust between afghans and pakistanis . 
another member of the council ,  shumaila zaib ,  believes part of the problem is lack of interaction . 
pakistanis and afghans are facing a lot of the same challenges . 
we both have insurgents trying to interfere with our day to day lives . 
getting a chance to understand that we suffer the same challenges really helps keep us from blaming the other for our problems ,  she said . 
only ten percent of the citizens of kyrgyzstan know their rights
according to assessments from the legal defence organisation ,  kyrgyzstan is not an electoral democracy . 
international observers have described the parliamentary and presidential elections of <num>2000</num>  , and also the parliamentary elections in <num>2005</num>  , as not free and not competitive . 
however ,  the presidential elections of <num>2005</num>  , which followed the march popular uprising ,  removed president askar akayev from power and were noted as significant progress . 
corruption is widespread in kyrgyz society . 
kyrgyzstan ranks 150t out of <num>180</num>  countries listed in the corruption perception index for <num>2007</num>  , compiled by the organisation transparency international . 
the mass media have started to be more open and tolerant of differing points of view since the popular uprising in march <num>2005</num>  and the subsequent change of political regime in the country ,  freedom house notes . 
however ,  the signs of increasing government pressure on the press that were seen late in <num>2005</num>  were also noticed throughout <num>2006</num>  and <num>2007</num>  .
asian partners fail to back russias move to recognise georgian rebel provinces
partners in the russia and china-led security and cooperation group have failed to give open support to russias recognition of the georgian rebel provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent nations . 
instead ,  they have limited themselves to giving credit to russia for its peacekeeping operation in the former soviet republic . 
as with many other international forums ,  russia tried to use this summit as a platform to put forward its perspective on the conflict in south ossetia . 
instead ,  it only credited russia for its so-called peacekeeping role in the caucasus . 
maria disenova ,  an analyst at the almaty-based institute for economic strategies-central asia ,  believes that the reason sco member states are not openly supporting russia is they do not want to complicate their relations with western countries . 
bush told him that no-one needed the war . 
we believe all actions of russia were aimed at protecting the civilians of that long-suffering town . 
in response russia could either ignore the suffering or stop the bloodshed ,  nazarbayev said . 
we would like to see the international community choose this path ,  not talk wherever about a cold war . 
i believe that russia  ( putin )  has pressed nazarbayev because it needs allies ,  although in the military sphere kazakhstan is not the best ally . 
however ,  kazakhstans support in the energy and international relations spheres means a lot to russia ,  she said . 
pakistan sees afghan support as key in fighting terror
pakistan prime minister syed yusuf raza gillani has said a better relationship with afghanistan is one of his key objectives in moving the country forward and combating terrorism . 
on august <num>27</num>  , <num>2008</num>  at a meeting with antonio guterres ,  the united nations high commissioner for refugees ,  he added that the repatriation of afghans refugees being honourable and not forceful is an important factor in ensuring their return is permanent and successful . 
pakistan has been a generous host to over three million afghan refugees for the past three decades . 
it is important that all afghan refugees register with the un in order for us to better plan and manage the repatriation process ,  said prime minister gillani . 
he explained why he thinks the environment in afghanistan must be conducive to supporting a flow of refugees from pakistan returning to the country . 
the afghan government ,  along with the international community ,  must prioritise areas of development and reintegration projects to help new returnees successfully settle back into afghan society ,  otherwise many will be discouraged and return to pakistan ,  he said . 
the new government of pakistan has emphasised that a stable and prosperous afghanistan is very much in the interest of not only pakistan ,  but the entire region . 
prime minister gillani said a well planned reintegration must occur otherwise the returnees will be forced to move to neighbouring countries once again . 
land allocation schemes are among many initiatives the afghan government are implementing in order to support returnees . 
but antonio said ,  more needs to be done in afghanistan for development and reconstruction to enable sustainable repatriation . 
we must recognise and appreciate the generous hospitality of the government of pakistan towards afghan refugees . 
while the un is helping assist afghan refugees to return to pakistan ,  they are also supporting both displaced afghans and pakistanis . 
currently ,  unhcr is assisting the internally displaced people of swat and bajour in camps and shelters in pakistan . 
antonio announced that unhcr in coordination with undp and other un agencies are planning to launch a pilot programme worth <num>135</num>  $  million to help rehabilitate refugees and support community development in pakistans north-west frontier province  ( nwfp )  and baluchistan . 
husain haqqani ,  pakistans ambassador to the united states ,  has also pledged the country will work with afghan officials to do more to combat terrorism . 
earlier this month ,  pakistans chief army general ashfaq parvez kayani visited afghanistan to meet with officials from the tripartite committee . 
the committee is a mix of afghan ,  pakistani and nato intelligence officers working together to combat terrorism . 
the tripartite was created in <num>2007</num>  and pakistans new government has pledged its commitment to supporting and strengthening the initiative . 
faryab women gain power in the police force
everyday i think of his life and the sacrifice he made for our country . 
i want my children to understand the importance of serving their country with the same loyalty as their father ,  she said . 
the mother of two believes that more afghan women should take a lead role in securing the development and safety of their country . 
women make up half of afghan society and have an important role to play . 
her colleague aziza agrees and says ,  we both have pledged service to our country for a long time and plan to retire soon . 
our biggest hope is that new female police will take our places . 
aziza and saliha both received support from their families ,  especially their fathers and husbands ,  when they started their career as police officers . 
increasingly ,  they are seeing more women who take an interest in joining the police force also receive strong family support . 
my family is happy that i serve my country and help make it safe . 
we ,  in the anp ,  are trying to do our job in the best manner in spite of the many obstacles and restrictions ,  says aziza . 
the mother of four says that women should not be scared to join the anp because people respect and trust female officers . 
she also says that while it is a womens duty to take care of her family ,  it is also her duty to take care of her country . 
one of the newest female police officers in their division is <num>47</num> -year-old widow kimya maryam . 
she has proved that age and gender are not a handicap . 
i lost my house along with everything i owned . 
i needed to earn a living for myself and applied to be a female officer . 
after being accepted into the anp ,  she attended police training courses in mazar-e sharif . 
kimya also says that since she has started wearing a uniform ,  she has felt trusted and well respected . 
there is an opportunity for them to attain positions high up in the ranks and we are expecting more and more women to join ,  she said . 
feasibility and security are key for kazakh choice of oil export routes
kazakhstan will stick to its multi-vector policy in exporting oil ,  and continue to regard an export route through the caucasus as a factor of stability in the region ,  according to the countrys prime minister and chief oilman . 
kazakhstan will continue to implement a strategy for diversifying energy routes . 
the choice of one route or another will be prompted only by the considerations of economic feasibility and pragmatism . 
both in foreign policy and economic relations kazakhstan has been trying hard to adhere to a so-called multi-vector policy when it balances the interests of global players ,  such as the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  russia ,  the eu and china ,  attempting not to anger any of them . 
this policy has enabled kazakhstan to ship oil by tanker over the sea and pump it into the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline despite russias protests . 
kairgeldy kabyldin ,  head of kazakhstans national oil and gas company kazmunaygaz ,  said at the forum that the recent military conflict in georgia had no significant impact on kazakh oil shipments via that country . 
moreover ,  he believes increasing oil transits through the caucasus might become a factor for stability in the region . 
oil sector is a key for kazakhstans economic development and signs of its recent oil-driven boom are obvious in the new administrative centre of astana
actually it was set to happen in october <num>2013</num>  , but it is impossible to start  [ production ]  in winter ,  so it will happen in <num>2014</num>  , kulibayev said . 
we expect to produce <num>450,000</num>  barrels per day at kashagan in <num>2014</num>  .
onshore and offshore facilities should be ready and transport issues should be sorted out by that time . 
special ambassador of uzbekistan in turkey ulfat kadyrov met with the mayor of izmir ,  turkey ,  aziz kocaoglu ,  seen earlier this year ,  to announce the opening of an honorary uzbekistan consulate in the turkish city . 
in conjunction with the trade show ,  a meeting is planned for august <num>27</num>  to include izmir business leaders . 
during this meeting ,  the staff of uzbekistans diplomatic mission will speak on investment opportunities in uzbekistans economy . 
its widely anticipated that turkish citizen bilal dogan ,  born in <num>1958</num>  in the city of malatya in eastern turkey ,  will become the honorary consul of uzbekistan in izmir . 
his ancestors were emigrants from the area around the uzbek city of bukhara . 
dogan is a member of the izmir chamber of commerce and is well known to local and regional television stations ,  for which he provides economic reports on live tv . 
according to dogan ,  the honorary consulate will be located in the central part of izmir ,  not far from the metro station and the hilton hotel . 
several hundred families of ethnic uzbek descent live in and around izmir . 
fergana . 
ru reports the possibility that the izmir society of turkistanis will also benefit from the honorary consulate opening its doors . 
the second wave of immigrants arrived in turkey in <num>1952</num>  from afghanistan . 
lastly ,  the third group of uzbek refugees also came from afghanistan in <num>1982</num>  .
another group from uzbekistan also resides in turkey :  tatars from bukhara . 
their population before <num>1970</num>  was around <num>200</num>  people ,  living predominantly in a single village in the konya province . 
subsequently ,  a portion of these bukhara tatars moved from konya to ankara ,  while another eighty left to work as migrant labourers in europe . 
fifty-five families who had emigrated from afghanistan to turkey in <num>1982</num>  were resettled in gaziantep . 
another thirty families joined them at a later date . 
all these families banded together to build a so-called uzbek village . 
last year ,  turkey followed through on its conception of a home for all turkic peoples of the world and unilaterally dropped visa requirements for a host of turkic-speaking countries . 
the decision took effect on july <num>30</num>  , <num>2007</num>  and ,  besides uzbekistan ,  also affected tajikistan ,  turkmenistan ,  azerbaijan and mongolia . 
similar visa-free entry existed previously for two other turkic-speaking countries-kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan . 
despite the criticisms ,  turkish president abdullah gul made an announcement at that time ,  in which he stated that his country is in favour of the wholesale elimination of visas between turkic-speaking countries . 
russian centre opens in tajikistan on sidelines of cis intelligentsia forum
the russky mir foundation opened a russian centre on <num>18</num>  september in dushanbe on the sidelines of the third cis forum for scientific and creative intelligentsia . 
the centre was established within the russian-tajik slavic university  ( rtsu )  . 
according to prima-news at the russian embassy in dushanbe ,  this is the second of the four russian centres that the foundation plans to create in tajikistan ,  and its eighth within the cis . 
however ,  the russian centre at the rtsu is now the largest centre with modern equipment opened by the russky mir foundation in a cis state .

mental health care improves nationwide
doctors at a kabul army hospital say that increased feelings of anxiety and insecurity caused by suicide bombings across afghanistan has given them the opportunity to treat more patients who are suffering from mental trauma . 
the national army hospital says that each year they treat some <num>1,000</num>  patients who suffer from mental illnesses . 
it is an environment that can be extremely stressful . 
we are more capable of recognising mental illness and successfully treating it ,  he said . 
harris durrani ,  another patient in the hospital ,  was abducted and beaten with a cable . 
after being robbed ,  he was eventually released and began suffering from nightmares . 
i have not been able to sleep well at night since that incident . 
it is not easy to cope and move forward when such things happen to you ,  he says . 
the afghan government has identified mental health as one of its five health priorities . 
they have worked to integrate mental health into the basic health care services of afghanistan . 
such efforts have helped lead to a rapid expansion of basic mental health services for afghans across the country . 
previously ,  kabul ,  shiberghan and nanghahar were the only provinces in afghanistan that offered specialised mental health care . 
the afghan ministry of public health has developed a basic package of services ,  which includes mental health care ,  to be available in all districts of the country . 
its five priority areas include maternal and newborn health ,  child health and immunisation ,  public nutrition ,  communicable diseases and mental health . 
while hospitals are able to treat mental health illnesses ,  the afghan governments policy shift has allowed for all clinics across the country to be able to provide similar treatment . 
without proper integration of mental health services ,  such illnesses are often misdiagnosed . 
integrating mental health care into the primary health system also allows for more social support since illnesses are more easily recognised . 
prime minister pledges to uplift the countrys poorest province

within an hours drive of pakistans vibrant financial capital of karachi in sindh province lies the countrys poorest villages in the neighbouring province of baluchistan . 
unlike karachi that is bustling with job and educational opportunities ,  most people in baluchistan are jobless and have no access to gas or basic utilities . 
since few work opportunities exist ,  many villagers find odd labour jobs or resort to selling wood to earn barely a dollar a day . 
the provice has the highest illiteracy rate in pakistan ,  and also suffers from a lack of schools . 
pakistani prime minister syed yousuf raza gilani has pledged to pour millions of dollars into development funds for this long neglected province . 
the prime minister instructed the planning commission to renew its funds aimed at helping development in the province . 
the move came after a group of lawmakers led by chief minister nawab aslam raisani briefed the new prime minister on the poor financial position of the province and recommended he not make cuts in its development funds . 
baluchistan has been under-developed over the years and the democratic government is eager to give priority to its development ,  he said . 
inflation has caused an economic hit throughout pakistan and recent floods and rains have caused much hardship in the province . 
many roads have been destroyed making it impossible for farmers to deliver their goods to markets . 
as a result ,  chief minister raisani has also pushed for the completion of the national highway projects in baluchistan that are currently under construction . 
more than <num>80</num>  percent of the highway is complete with the remaining portion set to be finished by the end of the year . 
meanwhile ,  the united nations development programme  ( undp )  ,  working with the provincial government of baluchistan ,  is providing <num>400,000</num>  $  for the gender justice through musalihat anjuman project  ( gjtmap )  . 
the four year project aims to support the local government in strengthening its dispute resolution mechanisms targeting women and vulnerable groups who normally do not have access to legal representation . 
the project is being implemented by the ministry of local government and rural development and supported by the judiciary and police . 
over <num>132</num>  groups have been established in the districts of lasbela ,  quetta ,  loralai ,  gawadar and ziarat to help solve informal disputes . 
already more than <num>350</num>  cases have been resolved having to do with matters such as domestic violence ,  property and financial disputes . 
each group has a female counsellor to ensure gender sensitivity in cases involving women . 
officials in baluchistan are eager for the project to be adopted throughout the province .

astana cycling team will be in the tour <num>2009</num>  .
theres no doubt about it . 
already a few months ago ,  all protour teams signed an agreement with the organiser aso  [ amaury sports organisation ]  . 
in <num>2008</num>  , astana was banned from the tour because of past doping issues . 
the damage caused by this team to the tour de france and cycling in general ,  both in <num>2006</num>  and <num>2007</num>  , led to their exclusion ,  organisers said . 
we were excluded in <num>2008</num>  , but aso told us that that would be for only one season . 
astana still had a successful <num>2008</num>  .
team leader ,  alberto contador ,  added this years vuelta a espana to his giro ditalia and <num>2007</num>  tour de france titles . 
in late september it was announced lance armstrong ,  seven-time winner of the tour de france ,  will come out of retirement and ride for astana . 
armstrong ,  a survivor of testicular cancer ,  decided to return to cycling to raise awareness about the disease . 
armstrong will be reunited with bruyneel ,  who worked with the rider up to his retirement in <num>2005</num>  .
lance and i have a unique relationship ,  said bruyneel . 
its like a reunion with old schoolmates ,  with one big difference :  we all  ( except me )  still have the same competition weight . 
i can guarantee you lance will be ready to perform very well . 
bruyneel had no doubts that armstrongs comeback would be a successful one . 
personally ,  i think he will surprise the world .

 " the visit by this friendly country's prime minister is aimed at identifying further areas for cooperation between the fraternal turkmen and turkish people and to give new momentum to the longstanding and fruitful dialogue between our nations ,  "  tdh reports . 
since establishing diplomatic ties ,  turkmenistan and turkey have inked more than <num>98</num>  different agreements . 
these documents have laid the groundwork for regular flights between the countries ,  established joint projects ,  registered corporate subsidiaries ,  affiliates and local offices in turkmenistan and deepened trade and economic ties between the partners . 
suicide blast at pakistan police hq ,  fighter jets lead airstrike
in islamabad ,  seven people were injured when a suspected militant blew up a car bomb outside an anti-terrorist squad building . 
the blast ripped off the facade of the red brick building ,  an afp correspondent said . 
a team of police commandos left the building minutes before and that led to confusion over the casualty toll ,  but now all of them are accounted for and we have seven injured ,  police inspector ehsan khan told afp . 
pakistani fighter jets and helicopter gunships destroyed a taliban facility in swat ,  causing heavy casualties ,  officials said <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
five civilians were also killed in the crossfire between troops and militants in swat ,  they said . 
pakistani ambassador hussain haqqani . 
pakistan and afghanistan are brother states and it is a mistake to be dismissive of president hamid karzai . 
pakistan must have a good relationship with the afghan government and nato in order to strengthen the border region ,  haqqani said . 
haqqani also called for a better relationship with neighbouring india ,  saying that that the pakistani army needs to reassure its neighbours that and they have no reason to feel wary or insecure regarding pakistan .

the exhibition isnt just a space for demonstrating the newest achievements in the medical field ;  it is also a place to conclude agreements and deals that will define future developments in the health care field . 
one more attraction for exhibitors is the opportunity it affords them to gain access to the potential of the health market in afghanistan . 
nazudrinova also noted that the wide interest shown in the exhibition reflects the tajik governments efforts to reform the countrys health care system . 
the republics leaders have established a list of medications ,  medical and pharmaceutical equipment and medical tools which are exempt from value added tax and customs fees upon import ,  she said . 
this provided quite a significant incentive for foreign companies to take part in the exhibition and display items that are on the exempted list .

moscow-the state of press freedom in the central asian states is unimproved according to reporters without borders ,  a well-regarded international media ngo . 
there have been no murders of journalists recently in low-ranked tajikistan ,  but their work continues to be fundamentally obstructed there . 
according to freedom house ,  another well regarded international media ngo ,  tajik journalists face censorship ,  impeded access to information and some have been charged with criminal liability . 
recent changes to the criminal code have put the internet on the same level as other mass media meaning that journalists on internet websites can now also be charged with criminal liability for slander and defamation . 
in uzbekistan ,  as amnesty international has attested ,  human rights activists and journalists have reported receiving threats from employees of security agencies . 
several of them have reported attacks ,  beatings and detentions by members of law enforcement bodies or people thought to be working for security agencies . 
press freedom in turkmenistan does not exist . 
opposition websites are blocked ,  authorities closely monitor internet use and national mass media outlets are simply unable to provide the population with access to objective political information .

astana-this month marks <num>15</num>  years since the president of kazakhstans bolashak  [ future ]  collegiate scholarship was first awarded . 
in <num>1993</num>  , for the first time in the history of the post-soviet republics ,  public funding was made available to talented young people to fully cover the cost of their studies abroad . 
in the beginning ,  there were barely <num>100</num>  scholarship recipients . 
today ,  <num>4,446</num>  kazakhstani young people receive the bolashak . 
those who qualify have unique access to education at leading universities in <num>30</num>  countries .

only two percent of suicides in tajikistan are people with psychiatric disorders ;  the rest appear to be the result of personal and social circumstance . 
 ( photo by nemenov / afg / getty images ) 
tajikistan-law enforcement officials are sounding the alarm over a rise in the countrys suicide figures . 
according to the prosecutor-generals office ,  <num>450</num>  suicides have been recorded this year ,  <num>15</num>  more than during the same period last year . 
of these suicide victims ,  <num>320</num>  were unemployed ,  more than half were young women ,  and <num>90</num>  were minors . 
director of the institute for economic research at the ministry of economics and trade nuriddin kayumov argues that thorough analysis is needed of all the factors leading to suicide . 
according to psychologists ,  many suicides are a result of conflicts in the family ,  in particular domestic abuse which many young women suffer at the hands of their husbands and their families . 
many tajik women prefer to remain silent about such abuse ,  not to air dirty laundry in public . 
 '  they do not talk to friends about it ,  let alone seek help from the police ,  "  psychologist inna safiullina points out . 
law enforcement officials see a possible solution to the rise in suicides through reviving an old soviet practice :  registering and tracking at-risk families . 
psychologists differ ,  viewing the problem through a socio-economic lens ;  they believe that only through reducing unemployment and implementing a series of much-needed social reforms can this issue be tackled .

<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  secretary of state condoleezza rice said she  " found a pakistani government that is focused on the threat and understands its responsibilities to respond to terrorism and extremism wherever it is found .  " 
asian and western officials have linked the mumbai attacks to a militant islamic group ,   ' lashkar-e-taiba '  . 
according to indian officials ,  the sole mumbai gunman captured alive admitted to being a pakistani and member of lashkar . 
lashkar-e-taiba ,  which means  " army of the pure ,  "  is headed by hafiz muhammad saeed ,  who has been jailed in pakistan . 
in <num>2002</num>  , then-pakistani president pervez musharraf outlawed the organization ,  but did not ban a charitable foundation also headed by saeed ,   ' jamaat-ud-dawa '  .

turkmenistan - the turkmen government plans to change the countrys national anthem ,  striking lines about turkmenbashi ,  the father of all turkmen ,  devoted to the former national leader saparmurat niyazov . 
the title turkmenbashi was niyazovs creation .

radio and television in afghanistan at a crossroads
afghani fm radio station
northern afghanistans radio quyaash has sold its generators just to stay in business . 
its one example of how some media outlets in the country are using any means possible to stay in business . 
hundreds of media outlets were created after the fall of the taliban in <num>2001</num>  .
but as donor money dried ,  several of the smaller stations find surviving on advertising revenue alone impossible . 
most of the countrys advertising revenue ,  estimated at <num>10</num>  $  to <num>12</num>  million  [ usd ]  ,  is confined to major cities . 
many smaller stations have been forced to shut down or rely on funding from local warlords . 
radio quyaash was one of the lucky few to receive support from the united nations educational ,  scientific and cultural organization  ( unesco )  to open an internet cafe last year . 
in a country where few can afford computers at home ,  the popularity of the cafe has provided enough revenue for the station to remain in business . 
the station ,  located in northern afghanistans faryab province bordering uzbekistan was created after receiving funding from the canadian international development agency  ( cida )  in <num>2003</num>  , and broadcasts in uzbek ,  one of the countrys dozens of minority languages . 
media progress has been regarded as one of the real success stories of the donor community in afghanistan . 
however ,  like in europe and north america ,  some independent news outlets will need state support to continue to stay on the air . 
radio television afghanistan  ( rta )  could potentially be transformed into a public broadcasting service ,  but the government is currently in disputes over whether or not it should be state controlled . 
after the fall of the taliban ,  the international community provided a lot of funding to help create media outlets . 
our problem is reaching out to people in the places where they are not allowed to go to school ,  and where they encourage community members to pick up a gun . 
rta has the potential to provide such nationwide programming . 
smaller stations that cater to local news and offer programming in the minority languages could be folded into the countrys national broadcaster . 
in the balkans ,  radio stations formed committees and were able to approach coca-cola and other advertisers ,  offering to play their ads on stations country-wide rather than a single major station . 
advertising revenue in afghanistan comes mostly from the countries four mobile phone companies ,  banks ,  and construction companies . 
the afghan government and foreign embassies also buy airtime to play public information ads . 
similar efforts are being made on a smaller scale to get advertising revenue beyond kabul . 
the results have helped keep several radio stations on-the-air . 
another issue is quality of journalism in afghanistan . 
while money supported initial training and equipment ,  not a lot emphasis has been placed on how to develop news organizations ,  and mentoring education needed to develop high journalistic standards . 
there need to be institutions to target training needs and encourage investigative journalism ,  researchers and writers ,  says dominic medley ,  who was the first country director for internews in afghanistan .

metal illness
he has been like this ,  day and night ,  lying in the open with nothing but a blanket for cover for <num>21</num>  days . 
each day he is fed only a scrap of bread ,  a raw chilli and two glasses of water ,  a verse from the koran placed in each one . 
he still has <num>19</num>  days to go before the padlock is released and he is free . 
despite appearances tahir ,  <num>35</num>  , is not a prisoner but a mental patient ,  and relatives have placed him in the grounds of the sayed mohammad ali shah shrine in eastern afghanistan in the hope of curing his illness . 
i have been sick for a very long time ,  "  tahir said ,  his voice painfully high and his face twisted into a grimace . 
 " for people with mental problems we give <num>40</num>  days' treatment ,  "  explained mir subadar ,  <num>48</num>  , who looks after the shrine and the patients . 
 " they have to have chili ,  bread and water . 
if they follow this diet ,  it cures them . 
many of subadar's patients show signs of shell shock ;  hardly surprising after <num>30</num>  years of war . 
others are drug addicts undergoing cold turkey withdrawal . 
others appear to have serious learning difficulties . 
five years after the taliban was removed from power ,  afghanistan's infrastructure is still in ruins . 
the country has few centres for treating the mentally ill so families bring their sick here from across the country . 
not even the medieval conditions shake people's belief in the shrine's curative powers . 
 " first they come and we speak to them and then we tie them to a tree . 
we provide all the food and charge <num>20</num>  £   [ gbp ]  ,  "  said subadar . 
although <num>20</num>  £  may not sound a lot ,  it is equivalent to a month's salary for a doctor or a policeman in afghanistan . 
many believe it is money well spent . 
 " if anyone has any doubts they should come and look at our shrine and see people being cured ,  "  said mamtaz ,  <num>26</num>  , a devotee . 
uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan strike gas deal
uzbekistan is to supply kyrgyzstan with <num>150</num>  tonnes of gas at the beginning of <num>2009</num>  .
in return for the gas shipments ,  the agreement obligates kyrgyzstan to provide uzbekistan with <num>600</num>  million cubic metres of water and the same number of kilowatt-hours of electricity . 
according to government statistics ,  kyrgyzstan buys <num>950</num>  tonnes of uzbek gas each year for domestic use . 
uzbekistan is required to provide <num>150</num>  tonnes of the total amount during the winter months at the start of <num>2009</num>  .
in a live question-and-answer session with television viewers ,  kyrgyz prime minister igor chudinov expressed consternation at the price hikes ,  which he felt uzbekistan had not adequately justified . 
kyrgyzstans leadership hopes to strike up a partnership with russias gazprom and privatise the public gas utility kyrgyzgaz in a bid to lessen the country's dependency on uzbek gas .

unlike the old currency ,  all of which bore a portrait of first turkmen president saparmurat niyazov ,  the new banknotes bear images of historical and mythological heroes . 
among them are torgul beg ,  founder of the seljuk state ,  its last distinguished ruler sultan sanjara ,  the poet makhtumkuli ,  and characters from the national epic ,  its hero gerogly ,  the musician gorkuta ata and the ruler oguz khan .

cervical cancer vaccination campaign in tajikistan
the vaccination is intended for adolescent girls from <num>9</num>  to <num>17</num>  years old and women <num>18</num>  to <num>26</num>  years of age . 
that amount was enough for only <num>6,000</num>  girls because each patient has to be vaccinated three times ,  kurbanov said . 
today in tajikistan ,  more than one-third of women of reproductive age are susceptible to the papillomavirus ,  which is transmitted through sex . 
in one of eight cases ,  the disease may develop into an oncological form . 
according to the ministry of public health ,  every year about <num>200</num>  women of reproductive who suffer from this disease are registered . 
of those ,  more than <num>160</num>  die . 
according to kurbanov ,  the high mortality is the result of ignorance about how to prevent the disease and a lack of the laboratory equipment necessary to identify the disease at early stages . 
most frequently ,  patients come to the oncology centre after the disease has reached its third or fourth stage . 
the ministry of health has taken account of the current situation to prepare a national action plan for prevention to reduce levels of morbidity from breast and cervical cancer . 
the vaccination of female students is the first step on the path to the realisation of this plan "  ,  noted kurbanov . 
the main emphasis of the plan is to publicise preventive measures nationwide . 
kyrgyz government officials step down
the former presidential aide said that his departure had been planned ,  but several political analysts in bishkek assert that bakiyev is reshuffling his team in response to growing opposition protests . 
he allegedly saved the president from a coup during the april <num>2007</num>  opposition meetings by sowing discord among opposition figures and later winning over a number of the presidents opponents . 
sadyrkulov himself hinted that he was perhaps not the right man to preside over the presidential administration in the current political climate . 
im well aware that the time has come for a new phase in our history to begin ,  he said . 
new approaches ,  new working methods and new faces are called for . 
this is why i feel certain that my work in this role is done . 
according to for justice opposition movement leader alikbek jekshenkulov ,  sadyrkulov was responsible for a lot of bad political and staffing decisions . 
opposition figures blame sadyrkulov for political chicanery which led to splits within the opposition ,  the dissolution of the parliament elected in february-march <num>2005</num>  and the election of a new parliament on the basis of parliamentary lists which resulted in the majority of seats going to the pro-government ak zhol party . 
after news of sadyrkulovs resignation broke ,  deputy prime minister elmira ibraimova announced that she too had stepped down . 
software programme converts cyrillic to arabic script
written communication between persian-speaking peoples has been a problem in the past due to the use of different writing-systems . 
our programme is now able to convert an arbitrarily written tajik text into persian script in seconds with <num>90</num>  percent accuracy . 
it can also identify proper nouns and abbreviations which do not have equivalents in persian ,  said fomin . 
the main difficulty in developing the programme ,  he said ,  was finding a way of correctly displaying diacritical marks representing short vowels ,  special letters and loanwords . 
written communication between persian-speaking peoples has been a problem in the past due to the use of different writing-systems . 
according to zafar usmonov ,  the tajik language underwent a number of changes during the soviet era . 
in <num>1929</num>  a writing-system based on the roman alphabet was adopted . 
in <num>1940</num>  there was another huge change with the adoption of cyrillic script . 
the scientific and cultural heritage that had been built up over the years became inaccessible to a large number of users ,  the academic notes . 
a need therefore arose for a system enabling swift conversion . 
this problem was tackled as far back as the <num>1980</num>  second  ,  but at that time the technology necessary to solve it did not exist . 
committee against political repression formed in kyrgyzstan

tajikistan - tajikistans leading economists held a round table to consider the predicted effects of the global financial crisis on the country ,  one of the poorest in central asia . 
the russian government has announced plans to cut its migrant worker quota by half this year in response to the first wave of the crisis . 
it was set at <num>3.4</num>  million last year ,  almost a million of whom are tajikistan citizens whose salaries are often the only source of income for their families . 
a decrease in the demand for labour in russia ,  the second wave ,  will generate a range of problems for the tajik economy including a decrease in the amount of remittances and increased unemployment ,  deportations and possibly social unreast . 
according to zukhra musayev ,  chief economist in the macroeconomics department of the ministry of economic development and trade ,  the crisis has also hit the republics exports . 
decreases in the prices and demand for aluminium and cotton have reduced budget revenue that may be offset if ways to utilize the nation's natural resources domestically are found . 
with textile production ,  for example ,  musayev says the nation could both produce quality goods that would find demand in foreign markets and create jobs for migrants who return to the country . 
aluminium case comes to an end

<num>27</num>  , <num>2008</num>  , talko withdrew a case it had filed in <num>2006</num>  against ansol ,  which has exclusive rights to supply alumina to talko and market the metal it produces . 
it was still unclear at present whether the criminal prosecution of the two main accused has also been halted . 
talko press secretary sayokhat kadyrova said that ansol ,  with the help of plant director ermatov ,  had illegally appropriated up to us$500 , 000 of talkos money between <num>1996</num>  and <num>2004</num>  .
as a result ,  eratov received real estate in london and moscow from the grateful ansol director ,  kadyrova said . 
ermatov was removed from his post at the end of <num>2004</num>  .
the tajik prosecutor's office began to investigate his activities ,  and ermatov fled the country .

global financial crisis hits kazakhstans cement industry
workers close the gates of the cement factory . 
 ( photo by reuters / david gray ) 
the directors of the enterprises said the situation was caused by a lack of orders and a drop in prices for construction materials in general . 
the global financial crisis caused cement prices to tumble from us$90 to <num>57</num>  $  per ton . 
tam khok suna ,  general director of centralasiacement ,  one of the two plants ,  said it will remain closed for six weeks . 
well resume production at both plants in march ,  he asserted . 
but to prevent panic ,  plant managers called it a temporary closure for technical repairs ,  not a work stoppage . 
central asian countries may face water shortage later this year
according to tajik foreign minister zarifi ,  central asian countries may face a water shortage this summer because tajik hydroelectric plants are completely discharging water collected in reservoirs to offset an electrical energy shortfall . 
last october five central asian countries signed an agreement on cooperative water energy resource use during the winter and the growing season ,  which has already been violated . 
as zarifi noted ,  because the importation of turkmen electricity through uzbek territory has been halted ,  a large amount of water is now being used by the nureksk and kairakkumsk hydroelectric power plants as an offset ,  which may lead to water shortages later this year . 
their reservoirs supply kazakhstan ,  uzbekistan and turkmenistan with irrigation water in the arid summer months . 
last october ,  turkmenistan ,  which has a large supply of energy ,  pledged to deliver <num>1.2</num>  billion kilowatt hours of electricity to tajikistan every year . 
this agreement was to be in effect until <num>2012</num>  .
the electricity was to be routed through uzbekistan . 
uzbekistan claimed the reason for this was that repair work was being done on two power lines of the karakul substation ,  which is connected to the turkmen serdar substation . 
after the agreement on cooperative water energy resource use was signed ,  kazakhstan vice premier shukeyev stated that his country ,  along with uzbekistan and turkmenistan ,  would do everything possible to help tajikistan and kyrgyzstan maintain water levels . 
the early collapse of that plan ,  however ,  is very likely to have a serious effect on agriculture next summer .

resurrecting afghan museums
a giant granite bowl standing in the entrance to the newly rebuilt national museum in kabul embodies the richness of afghanistans past . 
layered with history ,  the bowl was carved during the buddhist era . 
it provides an example of how the country has been transformed by centuries of invasion and trade ,  and how an appreciation of change is essential to rebuilding afghanistans identity . 
national museum director omara khan masoudi is well acquainted with the challenges . 
his association with the museum dates back <num>30</num>  years ,  including many painful experiences . 
he finally left the country in <num>2000</num>  , returning two years later when the post-taliban minister of information and culture invited him to take charge of the museum once again . 
when power changed from communist to mujahidin hands  [ in <num>1992</num>  ]  ,  there was a security vacuum . 
the museum was looted ,  masoudi said . 
for two years this area was cut off and we could not reach the museum . 
rocket attacks set the building on fire ,  destroying a large part of it . 
the publications will be produced by state media holding enterprise arna media . 
the state media holding firm arna media includes <num>22</num>  outlets including kazakhstans state television channels ,  kazakh radio and the official kazakh and russian-language newspapers el arna and khabar and their regional versions . 
according to kazakh journalists' union chairman seitkazy mataev ,  the joint print runs and audience size of the two pro-government media holdings completely overwhelm other mass media in the country . 
uzbekistan - tuti yusupova of the turtkul region of the karakalpakstan autonomous republic in uzbekistan may be declared the worlds oldest person . 
journalists report that according to her passport tuti yusupova is more than <num>128</num>  years old . 
her age became known when officials decided to count how many people in the country had passed the <num>100</num> -year mark . 
last year ,  yusupova and uzbekistans other centenarians were awarded the shukrat  ( glory )  medal . 
the main proof of the uzbek woman's age is her passport . 
but because yusupova has not undergone a gerontological examination ,  however ,  she has not yet been entered into the guinness book of records . 
the play ,  which won an award in the prestigious eurasia competition last year ,  was directed by novaya drama maestro vladimir michelson ,  who was specially invited from russia . 
the genre is virtually unknown to uzbek audiences and theatre professionals ,  but in the opinion of artistic director boris gafurov it is in line with the ilhom theatres main aim of introducing modern drama to uzbek audiences . 
khlam is a story of first love and maternal love ,  despair and hope ,  human beings and social conflict . 
durnenkov ,  a founder of the novaya pyesa  ( new play )  movement in russia ,  is the youngest of the durnenkov brothers ,  all three of whom are playwrights . 
it is no coincidence that the performance was directed by mikhelson since he too was one of the first exponents of the novaya pyesa and has directed plays by ugarov ,  aleshkovsky and limonov . 
khlam was the first production at the ilhom theatre to have been staged by a professional director since the tragic death of the theatres founder mark weil in <num>2007</num>  .

pakistan arrests main operator in mumbai attacks
islamabad-pakistan acknowledged for the first time that the mumbai terrorist attacks were launched from its shores and at least partly plotted on its soil ,  saying <abbr>feb.</abbr> 
<num>12</num>  that it had arrested most of the chief suspects including one described as  " the main operator "  . 
india's foreign ministry called pakistan's announcement  " a positive development "  and said it would consider islamabad's request for further information . 
malik said investigators had traced a boat engine used by the attackers to sail from pakistan to india and busted two hideouts of the suspects near the southern city of karachi . 
 " i want to assure the international community ,  i want to assure all those who have been victims of terrorism that we mean business "  ,  malik said ,  waving a copy of pakistan's initial findings at reporters . 
 " we will continue our investigation ,  but we want tenable evidence from india . 
we want full cooperation from india so that this kind of ring can be smashed .  "

tajikistan - in late january ,  a group of smugglers attempted to ship rare publications including a manuscript of the koran out of tajikistan . 
the press service for the state national security committee said the criminals were detained in customs . 
several lithographic publications of 19th-century books were found in their possession . 
the historical valuables had been part of a private collection for many years and their existence became known only when they were discovered by customs . 
the names of the smugglers and the owner of the collection were not released . 
even experts were unable to estimate the black market value of the confiscated rarities . 
the confiscated manuscripts and books ,  which included a scripture ,  dictionaries and treatises ,  belonged to the oriental studies and written heritage institute of tajikistan . 
for example ,  an arab-persian dictionary is a real find for scholars ,  said director of the institute karamatullo olimov . 
the koran was the most valuable find . 
the scripture dates back to the 18th-century . 
the manuscript has long since lost its original condition . 
after restorers work on it ,  the koran and the other confiscated books will be placed in the institute archives . 
the tunnel will be <num>4.5</num>  kilometer  long and will take two and a half years to build .

al-qaeda co-founder launches fierce attack on osama bin laden
the terrorist attacks on september <num>11</num>  were both immoral and counterproductive ,  writes sayyid imam al-sharif . 
 ( photo ipd ) 
al-sharif ,  who goes by the pseudonym dr fadl ,  helped bin laden create al-qaeda and then led an islamist insurgency in egypt in the <num>1990</num>  second  . 
but in the exposure of the exoneration ,  his new book written from inside an egyptian prison ,  dr fadl has launched a fierce attack on al-qaedas ideology and the personal failings of bin laden and his egyptian deputy ayman al-zawahiri . 
twenty years ago ,  dr fadl became al-qaedas intellectual figurehead with a crucial book setting out the rationale for global jihad against the west . 
today ,  however ,  he believes the murder of innocent people is both contrary to islam and a strategic error . 
every drop of blood that was shed or is being shed in afghanistan and iraq ,  he writes ,  is the responsibility of bin laden and zawahiri and their followers . 
he is equally unsparing in his criticism of muslims who move to the west and then take up terrorism . 
if they gave you permission to enter their homes and live with them ,  and if they gave you security for yourself and your money ,  and if they gave you the opportunity to work or study ,  or they granted you political asylum ,  then it is not honourable to betray them ,  through killing and destruction . 
zawahiri has alleged that his former comrade was tortured into recanting . 
but the al-qaeda leader still felt the need to compose a detailed ,  <num>200</num> -page rebuttal of his former colleague . 
the central question is whether this attack on al-qaeda's ideology will sway a wider audience in the muslim world . 
tajikistan president raises afghanistan at nato and eu meetings ;  promotes investment in tajik power generation
tajikistan - during his visit to brussels earlier this month ,  tajik president emomali rahmon stressed in his meeting with secretary-general de hoop scheffer that nato forces in afghanistan need to work closely with central asian states ,  in particular with tajikistan ,  which has the longest border with afghanistan of any country in the region . 
he said that the alliances military operations in afghanistan must focus on countering drug production and exports and the implementation of social and economic programmes in the country . 
rahmon also raised the issue of afghanistan and narcotics in his speech at the european parliament . 
he noted that since the beginning of the counter-terrorism operation in afghanistan ,  production of narcotics has quadrupled ,  and so far the international community has failed to come up with a strategy to tackle drugs in the country . 
the tajik president called on the eu to increase its aid to the countries of central asia and emphasised that the problem of afghanistan cannot be solved by military means alone . 
in particular ,  he said that the involvement of eu member states and nato in the construction of new hydroelectric power stations capable of supplying electricity to both tajikistan and afghanistan is important from tajikistans point of view . 
tajik political science expert parviz mulojanov points out that in august <num>2007</num>  tajikistan and afghanistan agreed to work together to build the dashtijum hydroelectric power plant on the pyandzh river along their joint border . 
it would be capable of supplying large afghan provinces such as kunduz and takhar and the region surrounding kabul . 
another project ,  construction of the rogun plant on the river vakhsh ,  tajikistan ,  will also contribute to providing electricity to afghanistan . 
unfortunately ,  mulojanov stated ,  neither tajikistan nor afghanistan can fund such large energy projects alone . 
therefore ,  in putting the spotlight on afghanistan in his discussions with the eu and nato in brussels ,  president rahmon hoped to stimulate europeans to invest in them . 
mulojanov believes ,  however ,  that no large investors are likely to step forward ,  and that tajikistan will have to dig into its own pockets if the rogun plant is to become a reality .

of course a first success must be confirmed ,  and the group of <num>17</num>  young graduates of the special music school of the turkmen national conservatory is going all out to prove that their success is no accident . 
the group is the product of the enthusiasm and creative persistence of its manager and conductor rasul klychev ,  a master violinist . 
rasul is still very young and has not yet finished college . 
he plans to enter the turkmen national conservatory . 
at age ten he completed the wonderful performing arts school as a member of the mukam violin group headed by harold niemark . 
rasul played in concerts abroad with mukam and received prizes and awards . 
today ,  as director of the chamber orchestra ,  he continues to perform with the turkmen national conservatory state symphony orchestra . 
the innovativeness of the youth orchestras concert programmes wins the public over . 
they perform works by turkmen composers chary nurymov ,  veli mukhatov ,  and redzhep allayarov ,  as well as tchaikovsky ,  bach ,  strauss ,  and vivaldi .

 ( photo by prakash matema / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - at the end of february ,  usaid provided assistance to hospitals and schools in southern kyrgyzstan ,  one of the poorest regions of central asia . 
the fact that gas prices almost doubled ,  combined with the low water level in the toktogul reservoir ,  which supplies the countrys largest hydroelectric power plant with water ,  have led to strict curbs on energy consumption and rolling blackouts . 
power has been cut in some regions up to <num>10</num>  or <num>12</num>  hours a day . 
usaid representatives said the agency earlier granted us$1 . 04 million for healthcare in kyrgyzstan in the form of back-up generators in <num>59</num>  high-priority medical centres in all seven provinces of the country and us$245 , 000 to enable all four of kyrgyzstans medical distribution companies to purchase transformers and consumables . 
teachers were acquainted with the sapattuu bilim project ,  which is aimed at raising educational standards by broadening the skills of teachers and headmasters and distributing new teaching materials to schools . 
the bilim project is being implemented in kyrgyzstan ,  tajikistan and turkmenistan . 
schools have been ordered to identify students who have fallen under the influence of religious extremist tendencies ,  monitor attendance at the friday namaz during school time ,  and take appropriate measures to prevent classes from being missed . 
according to human rights activist aziza abdirasulova ,  restrictions on freedom of religion are becoming a form of repression ,  often based on assumptions of participation in activities of banned religious organisations ,  and this must be stopped . 
as kyrgyzstan struggles with religious extremism it must not forget that harsh repression paves the way for instability ,  according to eu special representative to central asia pierre morel . 
kyrgyz journalist brutally attacked
kyrgyzstan - syrgak abdyldayev ,  a political commentator for the independent newspaper bishkek reporter ,  was attacked in downtown bishkek on march <num>3</num>  .
unknown assailants inflicted more than <num>20</num>  stab wounds and badly beat him . 
owner of the newspaper sultan kanazarov said the attack was related to the reporters political activity . 
abdyldayev is known in journalism and political circles for his pointed reporting .

marat tokoyev ,  the director of the social organisation journalists .

this is an attempt to instil fear in the public so people wont stand up to the authorities who have gone too far and are resorting to criminal methods ,  said asia sasykbayeva ,  the director of the interbilim human rights centre . 
a statement by kyrgyz journalism organisations notes that the atmosphere of impunity for crimes against reporters has promoted an increase in self-censorship in the media and caused journalists to flee to other countries . 
khar-a tribe in a pakistani region where the military has fought insurgents has agreed to stop sheltering foreign fighters and hand over local taliban leaders ,  authorities said march <num>9</num>  .
bajur is a rumoured hiding place of al-qaida leader osama bin laden ,  and the military offensive there earned praise from nato officials concerned that militants use pakistan as a base from which to plan attacks in afghanistan . 
the <num>28</num> -point pact was signed with the mamund tribe ,  which controls a large swath of bajur and whose ranks have yielded most of the top leaders of the local taliban . 
shafirullah khan ,  the top bajur government official ,  told reporters that the tribe also agreed to ban the display of heavy weapons . 
mamund tribal elder malik abdul aziz told reporters that he and his colleagues were in touch with top bajur taliban leader faqir mohammed and taliban spokesman maulvi umar ,  and that both had agreed to surrender . 
the mamund tribe also agreed to register the area's religious schools ,  which are often breeding grounds for militants ,  and to disallow the broadcasting of anti-government propaganda in mosques and other places .

courageous women from uzbekistan ,  afghanistan ,  russia ,  guatemala ,  iraq ,  malaysia ,  nigeria ,  and yemen were chosen from <num>80</num>  candidates for the honour this year .

un special rapporteur reviews religious freedom in tajikistan and turkmenistan

un special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief asma jahangir presented a report on tajikistan and turkmenistan on march <num>12</num>  at the 10t session of the un human rights council in geneva . 
jahangir said that ,   [ although ]  tajik authorities have taken a raft of measures to safeguard the freedom of religion and belief ,  a number of attacks on places of worship belonging to religious minorities have occurred . 
the tajik government recently outlawed a number of islamic groups associated with extremism and members of minority faiths including hare krishnas ,  bahais and jehovahs witnesses are also frequently harassed . 
jahangir said she was also concerned by the vulnerable situation of women in tajik society ,  which is also partly influenced by traditional factors . 
she proposed launching educational campaigns to tackle the subordination of women and the practice of polygamy . 
during the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  tajikistan was torn apart by a bloody civil war between the government and opposition forces which adopted religious slogans . 
after a peace agreement was reached ,  muslim opposition groups gradually disarmed and reintegrated themselves into civilian life ,  but religion remains a more central part of life in tajikistan than in neighbouring countries . 
one reason for this is that uzbek religious extremists from the islamic movement of uzbekistan have a long history of seeking refuge in tajikistan . 
jahangir also assessed the situation in turkmenistan and said that she was impressed by the high level of tolerance and the climate of religious harmony which prevails at the societal level in turkmenistan . 
she also noted ,  however ,  that the country has experienced arrests ,  intimidation ,  harassment and restrictions on the religious activities of individuals and groups ,  allegedly perpetrated by the authorities . 
although the situation has improved greatly since <num>2007</num>  , it cannot be said that religious freedom in the country has reached a satisfactory level ,  said jahangir . 
individuals and religious communities still face a number of difficulties due to the imposition by the authorities of legal or policy restrictions on registration ,  places of worship and religious education ,  her report stated . 
central asia officially a nuclear-free zone
in his statement regarding this matter ,  un secretary-general ban ki-moon noted specifically that the five-party agreement is the first nuclear-free zone created in the northern hemisphere in a region that borders two nuclear states ,  russian and china . 
the ban on development and deployment of nuclear weapons ,  however ,  does not prohibit the signatories from developing peaceful nuclear energy . 
the treaty also promotes the development of cooperation in using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes ,  environmental rehabilitation of areas that have experienced radioactive contamination and strengthening regional and international peace and security . 
within the next <num>18</num>  months ,  corresponding treaties will be signed with the international atomic energy agency regarding guarantees of the five countries to discharge their obligations under the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty .

two former national team footballers turned coaches ,  tofik shukurov and kamil mingazov ,  managed the ashgabat team to victory . 
lebap's coach ,  farida gataulina ,  still plays football herself .

to spur its development ,  the football federation provided the players with uniforms and balls . 
future plans include organising the first turkmenistan cup for women ,  which will take place this september in turkmenabat .

kyrgyzstan - kyrgyz minister of industry ,  energy and fuel resources ilyas davydov has announced that the power outages experienced by the kyrgyz public last winter are set to continue through this month . 
we must thank the nation for its understanding and patience in the face of the rolling power outages ,  davydov underlined . 
his deputy ,  akylbek tyumenbayev ,  stated that the official reason for the blackouts is a water shortage and that the outages could be suspended april <num>15</num>  - <num>20</num>  if the volume of water in the toktogul reservoir increases . 
the amount of water in the countrys largest reservoir ,  which has a capacity of <num>12</num>  billion cubic metres ,  is now just <num>6.4</num>  billion cubic metres ,  <num>146</num>  million cubic metres less than last years level . 
at present ,  electricity is being cut off for <num>8</num>  to <num>10</num>  hours a day ,  varying by region . 
power was fully restored to industrial enterprises as of <abbr>apr.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
on top of those ,  there are also emergency blackouts and power cuts for technical reasons . 
we are suffering huge losses because electricity is being cut off during working hours ,  from <num>12</num>  noon to <num>6</num>  <abbr>p.m.</abbr>  ,  say mukhtar rasulov ,  the manager of a travel agency . 
the government is working on a special programme to deal with energy emergencies during the autumn and winter of <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  .
authorities are also hoping that the construction of the kambar-ata-2 hydroelectric power plant beside a waterfall on the river naryn will help alleviate the crisis .

kyrgyzstan - supreme mufti murataly azhy zhumanov and the spiritual authority for muslims decided april <num>8</num>  on a standard uniform to be worn by all clergy . 
the countrys muftis and heads of the seven regional affiliates will be required to wear the uniform starting in <abbr>may.</abbr> 
zhumanov said the uniform was introduced for purely aesthetic purposes . 
we want the image of the clergy to conform to the national culture and traditions of the kyrgyz people ,  he said . 
the uniform is modelled on a traditional native robe made of white felt and is embroidered with kyrgyz designs . 
there is a separation between kyrgyz and uzbek muslims in southern kyrgyzstan and members of both ethnic groups try to avoid attending the others mosques in the region . 
older mosques are in areas populated by uzbeks while newer ones being build with arab charitable funds are in the kyrgyz community . 
the introduction of the uniforms might provoke internal conflicts among muslims in kyrgyzstan . 
the greater the pressure to adopt it ,  the stronger the reaction will be and that could lead to radicalisation which will provoke a religious ideological conflict within the country ,  islam expert kadyr malikov said . 
kazakh grain exporters look south
kazakhstan is a world leader in grain exports .

astana-kazakhstan is planning to shift its <num>2009</num>  grain exports southward ,  to afghanistan ,  iran and other central asian neighbours ,  agriculture minister akylbek kurishbayev announced at a recent press conference in astana . 
currently ,  kazakh delivers wheat to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  for us$181 a tonne ,  while russian and ukrainian wheat fetches <num>164</num>  $ -<num>170</num>  $  per tonne in black sea ports . 
this price differential has forced kazakhstan's government to consider making adjustments to its export strategy . 
in previous years ,  kazakh exporters sent grain through black sea ports to markets in the middle east ,  northern africa and the eu . 
this year ,  with that route saturated with more price-competitive russian and ukrainian wheat ,  kazakh exporters have been forced to look southwards ,  to afghanistan ,  iran and other central asian neighbours . 
 " we intend to create the conditions to allow us to increase kazakh grain exports to strategic markets in the caspian sea region "  ,  kurishbayev said at the press conference . 
kazakhstan's growers are expecting a bumper cereal harvest this year ,  which will allow the country to retain its place among the world's eight leading grain exporters . 
by entering shangla district ,  taliban violate agreement with pakistan government
the peace agreement between the taliban and the pakistani government was violated when taliban forces entered the shangla district on april <num>23</num>  .
eyewitnesses said more than <num>30</num>  armed taliban entered shangla and started patrolling loch bazaar ,  causing tension and fear among the locals . 
shangla is the second territory after buner that taliban forces have entered despite agreeing to end all militant activities in pakistan after moving into swat . 
taliban also warned shangla district lawyers of serious consequences if they continue to appear in non-islamic courts . 
lawyers are warned … not to appear before civil and district courts ,  a shangla district bar association member quoted the taliban letter on the subject as saying . 
the association have suspended a bar election scheduled for april <num>30</num>  because of the letter and have also informed the district police officer and district judges of the warning . 
pakistan prime minister gilani vowed to ensure government authority in swat and warned the taliban that it reserved the right to take other measures if the peace agreement is violated . 
we do not wish that a parallel government functions here or that such courts are set up ,  he told reporters after attending a briefing at the cabinet division . 
we reserve the right to go for other options if  ' talibanisation '  continues . 
maulana sufi muhammad ,  the chief of the supreme council ,  has indefinitely extended the deadline for the establishment of the final appellate court in the malakand region of the swat valley at the request of awami national party  ( anp )  senator zahid khan . 
the anp is the ruling party in the region . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  assistant secretary of state for south and central asia richard boucher said the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  plans to expand its sphere of cooperation with central asian countries .

he noted that in mid-march ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and tajikistan exchanged notes on the transit of non-military nato freight through tajik territory to afghanistan . 
boucher said his current visit to tajikistan could be seen as a new stage in <abbr>u.s.</abbr> -tajik cooperation . 
president obama and secretary of state clinton intend to expand the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  sphere of cooperation with central asian countries and work together with them to stabilise the situation in afghanistan ,  he said . 
tajikistan agreed to the transit of non-military nato freight at the beginning of the year during the visit to the country of a senior official of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  militarys transportation command . 
at the time ,  the amount of freight initially transiting tajikistan was estimated to be between <num>50</num>  and <num>200</num>  containers a week . 
any country bordering afghanistan is very important for us ,  boucher said . 
tajikistan is doubly important because its territory provides the shortest land route to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  bases in afghanistan . 
construction of rogun hydroelectric power plant dam to begin this year
tajikistan-on april <num>23</num>  , tajikistan's first deputy minister of energy and industry pulod muhiddinov announced that a tender for the development of a technical ,  economic and environmental assessment of the rogun hydroelectric power plant will be issued very soon . 
there are already plans to block off a channel of the river vakhsh in december to begin work on the erection of the rogun hydroelectric power plant dam . 
according to the ministry of finance ,  this stage will be financed by the state budget and will cost almost us$150 million . 
meanwhile ,  tajikistan minister of land development and water resources sayidi yokubzod announced that putting the rogun hydroelectric power plant into operation will open up more than <num>300</num>  hectares of new lands to agriculture and not just in tajikistan but in neighbouring uzbekistan as well . 
the rogun hydroelectric power plant will be at the sixth and highest level of the vakhsh cascade which is located <num>110</num>  kilometres from dushanbe . 
the preparatory phase of construction of a hydroelectric power plant with a capacity of <num>3,600</num>  mw was started in <num>1976</num>  .
in <num>1987</num>  , the erection of the dam began ,  and its height reached <num>40</num>  metres by <num>1993</num>  .
after the breakup of the soviet union ,  however ,  the construction of the hydroelectric plant was placed on hold and the dam was eroded by a powerful overflow stream .

 ( photo by jewel samad / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - on april <num>22</num>  , the kyrgyzstan ministry of internal affairs  ( mia )  charged altynbek itibayev ,  a former business partner of parliament deputy sanjarbek kadyraliyev ,  with the latters murder . 
according to mia minister moldomusa kongantiyev ,  itibayev confessed that he killed kadyraliyev because of ill-feeling over business matters . 
no details were provided concerning the specific disagreement between the partners . 
sanjarbek kadyraliyev ,  a deputy of the pro-presidential party ak zhol ,  was shot and killed on april <num>14</num>  in the driveway of his home in bishkek . 
based on itibayevs statements to the mvd ,  he was waiting for the deputy near his home . 
when the deputy exited his vehicle and his driver drove off to park it ,  itibayev approached kadyraliyev to talk . 
at that moment ,  kadyraliyevs mobile phone rang . 
police have placed itibayevs alleged accomplice on their most wanted list . 
incidently ,  ernst mamazairov ,  the deputys bodyguard ,  has also been arrested for possession of an illegal pistol and false documents . 
sanjarbek kadyraliyev was the fourth parliamentarian to be murdered since the <num>2005</num>  tulip revolution . 
he was well known for his criminal associations . 
the murdered deputys colleagues in the ak zhol ruling party faction ,  however ,  stated that the <num>32</num> -year old kadyraliyev was a  " young ,  up-and-coming deputy and was open and well-intentioned .  " 
kazakhstan ratifies caspian gas pipeline agreement
the current volume of gas exports from central asian countries casts doubt on the prospects for keeping the gas pipelines full without a significant rise in gas extraction in those countries . 
 ( photo by sergei supinsky / afp / getty images ) 
the agreement foresees the delivery to russia of <num>10</num>  billion cubic metres  ( bcm )  ,  a year of turkmen and kazakh gas . 
it also included the reconstruction of the old caspian gas pipeline that is projected to be completed in <num>2010</num>  .
the pipeline ,  about <num>1,700</num>  km long ,  runs along the caspian sea from the belek compressor station in turkmenistan ,  through kazakhstan to the alexandrov gai gas-measuring station in russia . 
during a visit to astana at the beginning of april ,  head of russia's gazprom alexei miller said that the pipeline's capacity in kazakhstan could double to <num>40</num>  bcm . 
in july <num>2008</num>  , gazprom and turkmenistan agreed to raise the capacity of the turkmen section of the caspian gas pipeline to <num>30</num>  bcm a year . 
in addition to the current central asia-centre gas pipelines ,  which have a total capacity of <num>50</num>  bcm a year ,  kazakhstan and turkmenistan are also involved in the construction of a gas pipeline from turkmenistan to china through uzbekistan and kazakhstan . 
that pipeline's capacity will be <num>40</num>  bcm a year ,  of which <num>30</num>  bcm will come from turkmenistan ,  and <num>10</num>  billion from kazakhstan . 
the pipeline should be launched by the end of this year or the beginning of next . 
the current volume of gas exports from central asian countries ,  approximately <num>50</num>  bcm from turkmenistan ,  <num>16</num>  billion from uzbekistan and <num>10</num>  billion from kazakhstan ,  casts doubt on the prospects for keeping both gas pipelines full without significant increases in gas extraction in those countries . 
development of hydropower within the framework of the eurasian economic community . 
an international conference dedicated to the prevention of water-related natural disasters is being held in the tajik capital of dushanbe later in june . 
according to yarash pulodov ,  general director of the scientific research institute at tajikistans ministry of land reclamation and water ,  thirty countries and <num>150</num>  international organisations will participate in the conference ,  which will examine the causes of water-related natural disasters . 
other matters ,  including drought ,  land exhaustion ,  the rational use of water resources ,  protection of water reserves ,  and climate change will also be on the agenda . 
it is these questions which are relevant today ,  particularly for central asia ,  where <num>25</num>  percent of those areas requiring irrigation are this year suffering water shortages thanks to drought . 
about <num>40</num>  percent of tajikistans irrigated land is receiving less water than usual ,  and this has a negative effect on agricultural production ,  pulodov said . 
according to anatoliy kholmatov ,  technical director of the international aral funds executive committee ,  a <num>5</num>  percent water shortage is not noticeable but if this becomes <num>20</num>  percent then the economy is affected . 
this has a negative effect on our ability to meet gdp production levels and on our profitability . 
the river varzob at different times of the year
three years ago a decision was made ,  within the framework of the regional organisation the eurasian economic community ,  to improve the management of water resources by developing the idea of hydropower interdependence . 
however ,  according to pulodov ,  there have been disagreements between countries over the drafting of the relevant document . 
in the past ,  tajikistan has put forward the idea of creating a joint central asian consortium for hydroelectricity - an idea that was supported by kyrgyzstan . 
in the course of his <num>2007</num>  visit to dushanbe ,  kyrgyzstans foreign minister ednan karbaev commented that ,  as two countries with water resources ,  tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have the potential to create a hydroelectric academy and hold an international summit to discuss hydroelectricity . 
we water-rich countries regard water as an integrating factor and not as a source of discord . 
kholmatov said that it is in the regions immediate interest to take account of the legitimate interests of each state . 
states whose water flows to other states downriver receive nothing in return . 
for this reason ,  the interest of the region as a whole can only be met if the national interests of individual states are taken into account . 
to that end ,  kholmatov believes an economic mechanism controlling the use of water resources needs to be developed and introduced . 
today ,  many of tajikistan's analysts are united in the view that agreement is essential on the issues surrounding the construction of new hydroelectric facilities on the rivers vakhsh and zeravshan ,  both of which have their sources within the republic . 
according to murtazaev ,  the other countries of the region benefit enormously from tajikistan's reservoirs . 
thus tajikistan's reservoirs have a stabilizing effect on the region's climate . 
according to the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  development programme for <num>2006</num>  , quantifiable indicators suggest that the lack of coordination in central asia has cost the region <num>2</num>  $  billion . 
kyrgyz residents of petrovka insist kurds be expelled from the village
kyrgyzstan - in the wake of the events of april <num>26</num>  when premeditated persecution degenerated into large-scale inter-ethnic violence in the village of petrovka ,  kyrgyz village elders met to try to resolve the situation . 
unfortunately ,  the outcome of their meetings was a demand that all kurds living in petrovka ,  without exception ,  be immediately expelled from the village . 
kurdish elders in the village immediately appealed to local authorities for help . 
as a result of subsequent complex negotiations among local authorities and the kurdish and kyrgyz communities ,  half of the <num>110</num>  kurdish families living in the village were selected for expulsion . 
according to kurdish representatives ,  his family left the village even before the gathering of elders . 
the kyrgyzstan association of kurds is now publicising other harassment of kurds in kyrgyzstan . 
kyrgyz kurdish diaspora leaders in kayirm village said their windows were smashed on april <num>29</num>  .
one kurdish family from petrovka tried to move to sokuluk district but was banned from showing their faces there and kyrgyz residents threatened to destroy the homes of all kurds in skokuluk . 
according to kyrgyz interior minister moldomusa kongantiev ,  responsibility for incitement of the inter-ethnic racial clashes in petrovka lies with the opposition . 
opposition politicians ,  however ,  deny the accusation and are calling for kongantievs resignation . 
residents of uzbek-kyrgyz border villages may need pass cards to reach their barns and gardens
border disputes between uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan hinge on differences in the <num>1924</num>  and <num>1956</num>  maps of their borders . 
kyrgyzstan - on april <num>30</num>  , the kyrgyz ministry of foreign affairs sent the uzbek ambassador a note of protest demanding an explanation for the april <num>19</num>  incident in the kyrgyz village of chek . 
uzbek police and border guards raided and searched the homes and gardens of kyrgyz citizens there on the pretext of conducting a counterterrorist operation . 
local residents confirmed that the homes of kyrgyz citizens were searched . 
the incident was repeated on april <num>23</num>  , but on this occasion uzbek border guards demanded that all cars with kyrgyz license plates be driven across the kyrgyz border ,  the location of which they determined unilaterally . 
they also told local residents that checkpoints would be set up on the outskirts of chek and that they would be allowed to cross them only with an uzbek-issued pass card . 
the kyrgyz foreign ministry note declared such actions violate international legal agreements to which uzbekistan is a party ,  and are openly unfriendly to kyrgyzstan and its citizens . 
the village of chek is just one of <num>70</num>  areas where the border between the two countries is disputed . 
kyrgyz prime minister igor chudinov said that border disputes arise over differences between maps made in <num>1924</num>  and <num>1956</num>  .
he said that the borders of the <num>1924</num>  map were based on the areas of residence of various ethnic groups ,  while the <num>1956</num>  map was based on the location of commercial or agricultural facilities . 
under the circumstances ,  it is likely that similar events will reoccur . 
victory day still commemorated across central asia
before the start of world war ii ,  <num>6.2</num>  million people lived in kazakhstan . 
more than a quarter of them ,  or <num>1.7</num>  million ,  were sent to the front to fight nazi germany . 
more than half of them never returned home . 
each and every family in kazakhstan bore a personal cost in that war . 
although generations change and feelings become more muted over time ,  there are veterans of the war who are still alive to carry the torch and the memory of the war lives on . 
a ww ii veteran lays flowers in memory of his comrades during the victory day celebrations on may <num>9</num>  in bishkek .

in tajikistan ,  the day was marked by the installation of a memorial stele and a portrait gallery depicting all the countrys heroes of the ussr and full commanders of the order of honour in dushanbes victory park . 
unfortunately ,  the ongoing financial crisis kept the country from staging the traditional military parade . 
this year marked the return of victory day to turkmenistan . 
during the rule of former leader turkmenbashi ,  the holiday was scrapped . 
the country's current leader ,  gurbanguly berdymukhamedov ,  has not only restored the celebration but has gone a step further by awarding each veteran and war widow us$70 along with a television and radio . 
as in previous years ,  kyrgyzstan's veterans were recognised by president kurmanbek bakiyev and his defence minister and awarded valuable gifts in celebration of the event . 
in central asia ,  victory day remains the most celebrated of all soviet-era holidays largely because every family in the region experienced the burden of that war in one way or another . 
among younger people ,  respect for the heroism of that generation remains strong and that may prevent it from ever being forgotten .

the purpose of the exercises was to test the coordinated response capabilities of border troops ,  the national security committee and the customs service in the event of an influx of refugees and to ascertain their capacity to provide refugees with adequate medical assistance ,  accommodation and care . 
the exercises were also intended to test how well the screening unit run by the provincial internal affairs department would operate and whether the national security committee would be able to identify criminals and persons subject to international arrest warrants among groups of refugees . 
south kazakhstan province was chosen as the venue for the exercises because it borders both uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan to the south-east ,  and because the countrys southern international border stretches for more than <num>1,000</num>  kilometres . 
furthermore ,  the low-lying area between the village of kyzyltan and the border with kyzylorda province is accessible to all forms of transport and can also be crossed on foot or horseback . 
firefighters demonstrated their ability to put out fires at the camp ,  and soldiers from a rapid response unit and the arlan counter-terrorism detachment carried out an exercise that tested their ability to neutralise terrorists . 
the president of kazakhstan has decreed that similar exercises are to be conducted at least once a year . 
kyrgyz government wants to develop commodities exchanges
kyrgyzstans stock exchanges have conducted more than <num>600</num>  trades worth us$400 million since the start of the year . 
 ( photo by kazuhiro nogi / afp / getty images ) 
kyrgyzstan - the government of kyrgyzstan wants to stimulate the development of commodities exchanges so gold can be traded on them . 
as he presented a new bill on exchanges to parliament ,  economic development and trade minister akylbek zhaparov said that while london and amsterdam trade gold on wednesday ,  kyrgyzstan will trade on monday and tuesday . 
the government will seek to reach deals with gold mining companies to sell <num>10</num>  percent of their gold on kyrgyz commodities exchanges . 
kyrgyzstan has three stock exchanges . 
the government financial market regulatory service said more than <num>600</num>  trades have been conducted so far this year . 
kyrgyz stock exchange led with a volume of more than us$400 million ,  followed by kyrgyzstan-bts with a volume of over <num>18</num>  $  million . 
central asia stock exchange was last with a volume of <num>10</num>  $  million . 
experts from neighbouring republics believe that three is too many exchanges for such a small country . 
idel sabitov ,  the first vice president of the kazakh stock exchange ,  said the existence of three exchanges in kyrgyzstan is hurting the countrys stock market . 
he said that the unnecessary competition it creates is slowing real growth . 
independent experts believe one stock exchange is enough for the country . 
amangeldy muraliyev ,  a former president of the kyrgyz stock exchange ,  is sceptical of the impact stock markets have on the economy . 
he said that despite impressive trading results for the first quarter of <num>2009</num>  , the flawed bill on exchanges proposed by the government must be blocked in order for the stock exchanges to become an economic indicator .

leading pakistan ulema declare suicide attacks un-islamic
islamabad - on may <num>17</num>  , leading ulema of pakistan declared that suicide attacks and the beheadings of people were un-islamic acts and said that militants in swat and fata were pursuing the agenda of pakistans enemies . 
they issued their edict at a convention of ulema and mashaikh from around the country . 
it was the first time that prominent ulema and religious scholars ,  mostly sunnis ,  had denounced the taliban and their inhuman acts in such a categorical manner . 
suicide attacks and beheadings are forbidden . 
they supported the military operation in swat and other parts of malakand and declared it a war for pakistans integrity and sovereignty . 
the ulema stressed the need for forging unity against militancy . 
mufti muneeb-ur-rehman of ruet-i-hilal said those who were fighting in the name of sharia must first abide by islamic laws . 
he said the taliban were even slaughtering children . 
this is contrary to the teachings of islam which call for protecting people who are not involved in battle ,  he said . 
if the taliban have any respect for islamic values ,  they should give up bloodshed because it is harming national integrity .

islamabad - on may <num>25</num>  , the taliban urged civilians to return to the swat valley's main city mingora promising they would not attack security forces battling for control of the city out of concern for the safety of trapped residents . 
the appeal also appeared designed to play on growing public concern for thousands still stuck in mingora amid shortages of food and water there . 
taliban spokesman muslim khan told ap that the taliban's pledge was not a formal cease-fire offer and that the islamist militia's  " aides "  would stay in the city . 
 " i would like to appeal to the people of mingora to come back to their homes and start their routine life as we will not fire even a single shot "  ,  khan said in a phone call from an undisclosed location .

i think they will very soon take their rightful place among their elders and delight tajiks with new victories . 
president of the tajik kyokushin karate federation hikmatullo karomatov commented that the global economic crisis had unfortunately taken its toll on the growth of the sport .

former iranian prime minister mir hossein mousavi
he is regularly quoted by conservatives exhorting iranians to stand firm against international sanctions imposed on tehran for its failure to comply with international resolutions ,  especially in relation to its nuclear programme . 
in the more moderate camp ,  mousavi is the strongest of the reform candidates hoping to return to government . 
mousavi has promised to change irans radical image by opening relations with the outside world and engaging in dialogue . 
he has stated that one of his first priorities will be to attract foreign investment and to secure funding ,  technology and expertise from abroad . 
mousavi has been challenging his rival with speeches on the economy and his plans to liberalise the country . 
he has promised the iranian people that he will reduce the soaring inflation rate and exploit the rich oil sector to create jobs ,  support industry and boost irans gross domestic product .

in terms of its quantitative parameters ,  this problem has today become a serious threat to normal development in various spheres of the social organism in the republic ,  causing concern in the world community ,  said bakhodir ismailov ,  leader of the institute for monitoring acting legislation under the president of the republic of uzbekistan . 
the law has been passed for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of joint action opposing trafficking . 
the document determines that the state bodies involved in preventing trafficking in persons include :  the national security service ,  the ministry of internal affairs ,  the ministry of foreign affairs ,  the ministry of health ,  diplomatic representations ,  and consular institutions in uzbekistan . 
the special commission will include representatives of all the power structures in the country ,  and they will co-ordinate the activity of regional commissions created in all parts of the country . 
in accordance with the law ,  those working in the special services have also been assigned the task of drawing up proposals to improve work in helping and protecting victims of trafficking in persons . 
in order to help and provide protection for victims of trafficking ,  institutions where they will undergo social rehabilitation are planned . 
in accordance with article <num>11</num>  of this law ,  in the event that they receive information about children who are the victims of trafficking ,  the leaders of the specialized institutions will be obligated to inform their oversight and trusteeship bodies about this immediately . 
if children remain without the guardianship of parents or do not know the whereabouts of their families ,  steps will be taken to find the parents . 
if a foreign citizen or a stateless person who has become the victim of trafficking is recognised as being a survivor ,  or has assisted our special services in exposing individuals suspected of trafficking in persons ,  such a person will be exempt from deportation pending the outcome of any criminal case against individuals guilty of trafficking in persons . 
and here ,  a victim may be granted the right of temporary residence in uzbekistan regardless of the circumstances of that persons entry onto the territory of the country ,  ismailov said . 
under the law ,  victims of trafficking will now be exempt from civil ,  administrative ,  and criminal liability for acts committed under duress or under threat . 
at the same time ,  persons judged by the court to be guilty of trafficking in persons will provide full compensation for the expenses associated with sustaining and rehabilitating their victims . 
in <num>2007</num>  the bodies of the uzbek ministry of internal affairs exposed more than <num>300</num>  crimes associated with trafficking in persons . 
the exposure of this kind of crime is increasing every year by an average of <num>100</num>  .
the countrys ministry of internal affairs ,  along with other interested departments ,  has already started to establish direct contacts with relevant authorities in the countries of the central asian region ,  and also with states that have significant experience in preventing trafficking in persons . 
the istikbolli avlod ngo was set up two years ago to co-ordinate and take preventive steps in the fight against trafficking in persons . 
this organisation is also helping to return victims to their homelands . 
according to the official figures recently published by the ministry of internal affairs press service ,  during the period from <num>2005</num>  to <num>2007</num>  , some <num>1,456</num>  citizens of uzbekistan were returned with the aid of this centre . 
the uzbek government has already embarked on the creation of a special database that will include all persons suspected of trafficking in persons . 
kurbanov said weekly monitoring and contact takes place among the special services in kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  the united arab emirates ,  turkey ,  italy ,  and a number of other countries .

what the students are specifically accused of is not yet clear . 
the arrests began on may <num>27</num>  in the cities of cairo ,  alexandria and el mansoura . 
special forces personnel rushed into apartments rented by the students ,  and according to witnesses  " grabbed everybody "  . 
according to information provided by russian diplomats ,  <num>73</num>  of those arrested are natives of chechnya ,  <num>12</num>  from ingushetia ,  <num>10</num>  from dagestan and three from tatarstan . 
the press office of the spiritual administration of muslims of kazakhstan  ( samk )  had no information about the arrests . 
samk press secretary ongar-kazhi omirbek explained that only one person is studying at the al-azhar university under the auspices of samk and he is a correspondence student . 
in mid-may ,  he travelled to cairo to take state examinations in order to get a diploma . 
according to omirbek ,  there are <num>100</num>  people from kazakhstan currently studying in cairo .

lessons from <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  philippines mission applicable in pakistan and elsewhere
andreas notter  ( r )  ,  an officer of the red cross ,  and one of the two european hostages held by the abu sayyaf group ,  speaks to a <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  military advisor after his release in zamboanga city ,  southern philippines ,  april <num>18</num>  .
pakistan has been reluctant to allow more than <num>70</num>  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  trainers into the country ,  because of worries about public reaction to a substantive <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  troop presence . 
but the low profile and public acceptance of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  military programme in the philippines suggest there could be lessons for <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  officers eager to step up their efforts with the pakistan military . 
over the last decade ,  the philippines has faced a number of security challenges and met them squarely ,  gates told the los angeles times . 
we will continue to support their efforts to defeat terrorists and extremists threatening their country and region . 
there are about <num>600</num>  <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  service members in manila advising philippine commanders and staff officers ,  a small force that has been able to reduce the influence of abu sayaff ,  the main muslim militant group there . 
 " one of the key lessons to take away is working by ,  with and through our allies "  ,  coultrup said . 
 " they assume ownership of the problems down there .  " 
the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  forces on the ground are focused on training ,  not direct military action . 
soldiers stay off the front lines ,  and instead advise and train philippine commanders and their staffs . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  officers who have served in the philippines argue that direct comparisons with iraq ,  afghanistan or pakistan are difficult ,  but they concede there are lessons to be shared . 
asked whether the philippines could provide a guide to expanding <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  involvement in pakistan ,  gates said the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  must be sensitive to the domestic politics of any country with which it forms a partnership . 
 " we will move with these various countries at a pace that is comfortable for them .

human rights activists call on kazakhstan to keep its promises
astana has assumed several commitments to bring its laws up to democratic standards as it prepares to assume the chair of the osce next year . 
members of human rights watch held a press conference in almaty on june <num>3</num>  during which they offered an assessment of kazakhstans readiness to chair the osce next year . 
while the country assumed several commitments to bring its laws into line with democratic standards to enhance its bid to chair the osce ,  the human rights activists said astana has not fulfilled them . 
his interlocutors left ross puzzled by constantly comparing the situation in kazakhstan to china ,  where the situation is worse ,  as if china represented the osce that kazakhstan would chair . 
ross said the organisation asked the government to state its position on any change in the law that would be in line with international standards . 
the conclusions drawn by the human rights activists and journalists were discouraging . 
for now our country has not kept its promises to ensure human rights and freedoms ,  and based on recent events is moving in the wrong direction ,  reported kazakh newspaper delovaya nedelya . 
ross said that if kazakhstan does not correct its human rights situation ,  its chairmanship of the osce could end as a public relations failure . 
fees at tajikistans universities may increase
hitting the books in tajikistan might become too expensive for many . 
 ( photo by ints kalnins  /  reuters ) 
dushanbe - the directors of tajikistans universities are seeking a <num>20</num>  percent fees increase for fees paying students . 
president of tajik national university muriddin saidov revealed that the proposal is being considered by the economic development and trade ministry . 
according to saidov ,  the fees increase would enable universities to remodel their buildings ,  increase faculty salaries and acquire modern academic equipment . 
toshpulod rabiyev ,  head of national monopolies at the economic development and trade ministry ,  said the university presidents first suggested the fees increase at the beginning of the year . 
in light of the impact of the global financial crisis on the economy ,  however ,  the ministry turned down the proposal . 
that drove the university presidents back to the drawing board and they developed a proposal with clearer links between increased fees charges and their impact on specific proposals to modify services which universities offer . 
under their current proposals ,  fees will vary depending on department and specialty . 
analyst amir sokhibov said the proposed <num>20</num>  percent fees increase could mean that many talented university applicants will go without a higher education and deny the country a cadre of trained professional specialists needed to develop the national economy in the future ,  with some possibly joining the ranks of the unemployed . 
currently ,  annual university fees range from us$600 to <num>1,500</num>  $  depending on the department and university ,  while the average monthly wage in tajikistan is just <num>60</num>  $  .

kazakhs understood that there was little reason to hope for a miracle in astana ,  although everyone wanted to see what kind of resistance the kazakhs would offer to the english masters play . 
the gap between the two sides was obvious as the kazakhs gave up four unanswered goals . 
still ,  the team showed its fighting spirit and desire to win ,  and the fans rewarded them with the applause they deserved .

unfortunately ,  professional athletic training for football in kazakhstan still has a long way to go . 
there are virtually no youth football schools in the country ,  which means that the national team does not match up to european championships teams in terms of the quality of play and players . 
while in the <num>1990</num>  second  that could be blamed on economic difficulties ,  today the economy is not the issue and kazakh sports fans have the right to expect more victories from their national athletes .

kyrgyz experts compile profiles of contemporary extremists
in the battle with banned extremist organisations ,  the official islamic clergy in kyrgyzstan does not have influence over muslim society . 
 ( photo by vyacheslav oseledko / afp / getty images ) 
extremists ,  who have in the past been seen as religious fanatics ,  are today ,  according to mirsaiyitov ,  sane and balanced persons who know their goals and are fully aware of their actions ,  a description widely accepted by strategic analysis experts . 
he noted that ,  according to the instututes research ,  members of extremist or terrorist organisations now often have backgrounds that include several types of education ,  including religious studies . 
in addition ,  according to mirsaiyitov ,  the assertion that the main motivation for a radical to join such an organisation is the need to improve his material situation is very outdated . 
previously ,  the majority of extremists in kyrgyzstan were citizens of uzbek nationality ,  but now there are more and more kyrgyz nationals among them and slavs have also appeared . 
as was noted at the forum ,  in the battle with banned extremist organisations ,  the official islamic clergy in kyrgyzstan has little influence over the country's muslim community because it is largely considered an element of a secular state institution . 
according to statements by forum participants ,  the authority of the muslim clergy is diminished in the eyes of the faithful because of its dependence on the state . 
the forum was organised by the social fund ,   " for international tolerance "  ,  with the support of the kyrgyzstan security council ,  the kyrgyzstan president's institute of strategic analysis and assessment ,  and the oslo coalition on freedom of religion or belief . 
japan to help tajikistan reduce disaster risk

 ( photo by munir uz zaman / afp / getty images )  . 
dushanbe - the japan fund for poverty reduction  ( jfpr )  awarded a us$3 million grant to assist tajikistan in minimising potential damage from floods and other natural disasters . 
project funds will be allocated through the asian development bank  ( adb )  and administered by acted ,  an ngo headquartered in france . 
the jfpr ,  an independent grant-giving foundation ,  was created by the japanese government and the adb in <num>2000</num>  .
nazhmuddinov said the main goal of the project is to manage the risk of natural disaster damage to the farm holdings of <num>130</num>  families in the farkhor ,  khamadoni ,  vose ,  pyanj and shuroobod districts in the khatlon region ,  the area of the country most susceptible to catastrophic flooding . 
he added that the families will work with ngos to develop individual plans to prepare for weather-related calamities . 
 " following approval of the plans by emergency situation committees and local authorities ,  local residents will be granted funds to implement the measures they proposed to prepare for floods and cope with their aftermaths "  ,  the minister noted . 
speaking for the adb ,  makoto ajiro noted that each year landslides ,  flash floods and avalanches cause serious damage to homes ,  farms ,  irrigation systems and transportation and communication infrastructures in tajikistan . 
 " rural settlements are inadequately prepared for emergencies "  ,  ajiro observed . 
 " in developing countries such as tajikistan ,  government resources are limited ,  and it's unrealistic to expect the state to finance all areas of disaster management . 
this project underscores the importance of bringing together local communities ,  the government and the non-profit sector to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters "  ,  he said . 
american technology for uzbek farmers
director of the central asian regional usaid office william frey ,  leader of usaid in uzbekistan james bonner ,  and regional director of the aglink project for central asia charles may talk with uzbek peasants who are part of the aglinks project
we want to restore the former glory of the uzbek melon . 
i remember thirty years ago when i used to go to my office on the tenth floor and was carried away by the sharp and fabulously sweet aroma . 
i used to go to the window . 
today there are no such melons . 
but there are still some people who remember the secret of growing them . 
we are giving them an opportunity to work again . 
aglinks is a usaid agricultural project working in the central asian countries of uzbekistan ,  kazakhstan ,  kirgizia ,  turkmenia ,  and tajikistan . 
the budget for the project until september <num>2011</num>  is <num>23</num>  $  million  [ usd ]  . 
abdushukur khanazarov ,  uzbekistans deputy minister of agriculture said :  when agricultural products have big added value this means that they are harvested from the fields in good time and quickly brought to market . 
during the course of the preparations for the aglinks project the american experts and their colleagues from central asia concluded that it would be possible to increase yields by <num>6</num>  percent in only three years . 
this increase would be enough to provide fruit ,  for example ,  for the whole of norway . 
we set a target to harvest <num>6</num>  million tons of fruit in <num>2010</num>  , said arabboy makhmudov ,  head of the department of fruit-and-vegetable growing in the fergana district . 
the buyers will be found only under strict conditions-an established arrangement for processing and transportation . 
we have enormous potential ,  and with the aid of aglinks we are determined to realise it .

turkmen deputy minister commits suicide after killing special services officer
ministry of national security officials control all spheres of life in turkmenistan . 
 ( photo by mustafa ozer / afp / getty images ) 
the shocking actions of former turkmenistan deputy minister of railway transportation durdymyrat chopanov ,  who stabbed a ministry of national security officer to death on june <num>12</num>  and then committed suicide ,  can be interpreted as retaliation against government corruption ,  turkmen human rights activists contend . 
the country's authorities have not yet commented on the incidents . 
on june <num>9</num>  , chopanov was removed from his post for ,  as president gurbangul berdymukhamedov's order states ,   " serious deficiencies in his work "  . 
the deficiencies were uncovered by the ministry of national security's special purpose department ,  an employee of which chopanov killed in his office by stabbing him with a knife . 
the former minister then killed himself in a restroom nearby . 
a writer for the web site contends that the ministry of national security has practically replaced regulatory authorities in all ministries . 
national security ministry employees monitor the harvesting of cotton and grain ,  the building of industrial and administrative facilities and trade ,  beginning with the state stock exchange and ending with commercial activity of small stores ;  they also control the activities of journalists ,  artists ,  scientists and bureaucrats . 
total surveillance ,  however ,  is not the worst of it . 
the main deficiencies of the system of control are the  " quotas "  that have been placed on the number of criminal cases security officials open ,  coupled with corruption within their ranks . 
another article on the ngo web site contends that the protection rackets which  " security officials "  have imposed on all small and mid-sized businesses prevent the development of full-scale private business ownership . 
the hope that a free economic class of small capitalists will evolve in the country is being strangled not just by the outdated laws but also by the feudal raids and fines levied by  " security officials "  at various levels . 
against that background ,  durdymyrat chopanov's action can be interpreted as the reaction of a state official who was not only constantly monitored ,  but was subjected to blackmail and extortion by the  " security officials "  who oversaw him .

tashkent - passenger rail service opened june <num>20</num>  between tashkent and the village of rybachye on lake issyk kul ,  the tourist gem of kyrgyzstan . 
experts said the new route will be beneficial for both kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan . 
uzbek citizens will be able to holiday in issyk kul at a lower cost and save considerable travel time . 
the tashkent-issyk kul train makes the trip in one day ,  while passengers traveling by bus generally spend up to six hours at the border . 
there is no stop at the border by train because customs officials are on board and making their checks along the way . 
the new route could substantially increase the number of people takings holidays at issyk kul resorts .

karachi - bilateral trade between pakistan and iran has shrunk steadily since fy <num>2007</num> -<num>2008</num>  because of the law and order situation in baluchistan and the fact that iranians are buying from other countries in the region ,  exporters said . 
that fell to <num>100</num>  $  million in <num>2007</num> -<num>2008</num>  , a decline of <num>44</num>  percent in a year ,  chairman of the small and medium exporters association  ( smea )  zulfiqar thaver said on june <num>27</num>  .
in fy <num>2007</num> -<num>2008</num>  , pakistans highest monthly imports from iran amounted to <num>80</num>  $  million in august while in fy <num>2008</num> -<num>09</num>  the highest monthly amount was less than <num>30</num>  $  million . 
pakistani and iranian officials have verbally expressed a keen interest in promoting their bilateral trade and economic ties ,  but in reality the situation is entirely different ,  an anonymous ministry of commerce official said . 
now iran imports millions of tons of rice and wheat from countries other than pakistan despite the fact that pakistan produces surplus rice and wheat and can supply a large quantity of both these commodities . 
on several occasions pakistan approached iranian authorities to supply wheat in bulk through a government-to-government deal ,  but the iranians expressed little interest in striking deals with pakistan ,  the official said . 
bilateral cooperation between pakistan and iran needs to be increased to tap the potential of trade ,  especially in agriculture items ,  said agricultural development commissioner dr qadir bux baloch . 
both countries should make serious efforts to enhance their mutual trade through the international cargo train currently planned for later this year to link the two countries . 
vienna - in its latest report on irans nuclear programme ,  the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  said that iran continues to expand its uranium enrichment programme in defiance of un security council resolutions ,  and is now operating <num>5000</num>  centrifuges and has stockpiled more than <num>1300</num>  kilogrammes of low enriched uranium . 
uranium enriched to low levels is used for nuclear power plants ;  at high levels of enrichment it can be used to produce nuclear weapons .

karachi - about <num>2,500</num>  al-qaeda and taliban terrorists are hiding in the kurram agency in the nwfp ,  where they frequently infiltrate afghanistan to target afghan army  ( ana )  and nato forces ,  shabir tori ,  chairman of the coordination council in federally administered tribal areas ,  a non-government organisation ,  asserted july <num>7</num>  .
i know that <num>2,000</num>  foreign and <num>500</num>  local terrorists are staying in kurram ,  from where they shift to afghanistan for few days to attack  [ their targets ]  ,  he added . 
its a difficult area for pakistani forces to penetrate ;  the only option there is to hit the terrorists with air strikes . 
intelligence officials also said that most of the foreign terrorists have either taken refuge in kurram agency or migrated to afghanistan after pakistani military operations against their strongholds in the nwfp . 
meanwhile ,  unmanned drone aircraft fired missiles at the training centre of tehreek-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  chief baitullah mehsud on july <num>7</num>  , killing <num>14</num>  militants and injuring several others .

 ( photo by reuters ) 
during the investigation ,  the criminal conspiracy charges brought against the defendants were dropped ,  yet the criminal code article on criminal conspiracy was the main one cited in the guilty verdict handed down by the court . 
furthermore ,  the maximum jail term sought by the prosecutor was seven years ,  but many of the defendants were sentenced to between <num>20</num>  and <num>25</num>  years imprisonment ,  bobokhonov said . 
judge nurov declined to respond to the procurator generals statement ,  other than to say bobokhonovs views are his subjective opinion ,  and only the relevant division of the supreme court is entitled to review the trial . 
the trial ended on june <num>10</num>  when <num>31</num>  people were sentenced to jail terms . 
two were released directly from the courtroom on the grounds of lack of evidence that they had committed offensives . 
those on trial included former provincial legislators from isfara ,  former directors of industrial and food processing companies ,  a sughd special police unit officer ,  and several entrepreneurs . 
the members of the group were found guilty not only of economic crimes ,  but also the <num>1999</num>  murder of tajik deputy procurator general tolib boboyev ,  as well as banditry ,  illegal possession of a firearm and the laundering of proceeds of crime .

the transition to market relationships in the economy in turkmenistan has introduced many changes in labour relations . 
 ( photo by mustafa ozer / afp / getty images ) 
turkmenistan - on july <num>1</num>  , a labour code approved by the country's president in april entered into effect in turkmenistan to replace one adopted in <num>1972</num>  that was subsequently amended a number of times . 
the new labour legislation was long overdue ,  as the transition to market relationships in the economy since independence introduced many changes in labour relations . 
the new code consists of more than two dozen sections ,  some of which have been instituted for the first time . 
under the new code ,  labour relations between employers and employees are governed exclusively by contract ,  which may be entered into for periods of no more than five years . 
introducing this standard protects employees from abuses by unethical employers . 
the list of people who have the right to additional paid leave has also been extended . 
this includes those who take part in on-the-job training ,  researchers working on dissertations and persons who are getting married . 
the new labour code reflects concern over the labour conditions of those who require increased social protection ,  namely women ,  the disabled and minors . 
it is too early to estimate the impact of the new labour code in protecting the rights and interests of turkmen working people . 
andijan terrorist suicide bomber identified
on may <num>26</num>  , a terrorist suicide bomber detonated explosives he was carrying on one of andijan's main streets ,  killing himself and a police officer and injuring over a dozen people . 
uzbek police state that all those arrested were residents of the khodjaabadsk district of the andijan region who were recruited into a criminal group by kamolitdin matkasymov ,  also of that district . 
he was the suicide bomber who on may <num>26</num>  in the city of andijan detonated the explosives he was carrying ,  taking his own life and that of senior traffic inspector captain bakhtiyar khalmirzayev ,  and injuring several innocent bystanders . 
the police report states that his identity was established through dna analysis . 
islamic jihad ,  a radical militant offshoot of the islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  ,  another terrorist organisation ,  claimed responsibility for the explosion in andijan and an attack on a police station in khanabad . 
it came to light during the investigation that matkasymov went to russia in <num>1999</num>  and later made his way to astana in kazakhstan where he came under the influence of religious extremists . 
after entering their ranks ,  he spent several years undergoing combat training in terrorist camps in pakistan . 
upon returning to astana ,  the uzbek citizen actively began to recruit fellow countrymen who were migrant labourers there . 
after that ,  they transported various prohibited literature on electronic media to andijan . 
new monitoring body created in turkmenistan
turkmenistan - amendments to the turkmen laws on non-government organisations and on the freedom of religion and religious organisations came into effect on july <num>3</num>  .
official media stated the amendments were required because of a counter-terrorism law that was passed recently ,  on efforts to combat the legalisation of proceeds of crime and the financing of terrorism . 
turkmen are sceptical about whether the country really faces a terrorist threat ,  and it is the amendments themselves that have caused increased public concern . 
experts and civil society advocates are worried that they may restrict activities of people who have no link whatsoever with terrorism . 
tajikistan eliminates weapons delivery channel
dushanbe - on july <num>19</num>  , two armed men transporting explosives were arrested in khorog ,  the administrative centre of tajikistan's gorno-badakhshan autonomous region . 
according to the tajikistan ministry of internal affairs  ( mia )  ,  during the course of a joint mia and narcotics enforcement agency operation ,  seven units of satellite communications equipment ,  binoculars ,  grenades and a large number of explosives were seized from the suspects . 
one is a resident of the isfarin region of tajikistan . 
the identity of the second suspect is being verified . 
the investigation has established that the suspects lived in khorog for the last few months in a rented flat . 
tajikistan strengthened security along the border with afghanistan ,  directing additional police and special forces groups to the darvoz and shurabad sections ,  from which incursions by illegal armed bands and drug trades are most likely to take place . 
currently ,  the situation on the afghan border ,  as law enforcement authorities note ,  is under control . 
at the same time ,  motor service and cargo transfer to the neighbouring country and back is proceeding routinely .

the commission also directed the kse to carry out a comprehensive review of futures trading for three months starting in august ,  and submit its report to the commission thereafter ,  ghaznavi said . 
depending on its findings ,  the report may lead to expanding the list of companies allowed to trade futures . 
the kse board of directors approved a road map for the development of the market ,  he added . 
the resumption of futures trading will improve the sentiment of the market and encourage small investors to buy ,  naeem securities ceo muhammad naeem said . 
the deliverable future contracts market was discontinued a few months ago during the kses response to the global economic crisis . 
those companies are currently the top performers in the kse . 
a kse official said its board initially recommended only <num>10</num>  companies for futures trading ,  but the secp selected eighteen . 
the commission also established more exhaustive eligibility criteria other companies must meet before they will be allowed into the futures market . 
they are safeguards that will enhance transparency and prevent speculators from manipulating the prices of securities .

a henna-haired labourer moves sacks of sugar at a market in karachi . 
the ccp was formed in november <num>2007</num>  , and its first report ,  the state of competition in pakistan <num>2008</num>  , highlights the operating mode of major sectors of the economy that provide goods and services to consumers ,  mirza said . 
the report said <num>29</num>  cement companies operating in the country manipulate production and supply and raise prices to maximise profits . 
in <num>2008</num>  , the ccp imposed us$2 . 5 million of penalties on five leading banks and the pakistan banking association ,  barring them from continuing to operate collusively ,  the report added . 
the report also revealed that the sugar industry is maintaining a parallel pricing structure to earn abnormal profits . 
in addition ,  between <num>1994</num>  and <num>2002</num>  , honda ,  suzuki and toyota increased the prices of their vehicles at least six times with the result that prices in pakistan were more than double those in the neighbouring countries ,  the report said . 
premiums on the cars became very high as those manufacturers ,  despite charging the full cost of vehicles upfront ,  delivered them with delays of up to nine months . 
the huge gap between supply and demand persisted for <num>12</num>  years and doubled the profits of the carmakers each year ,  the report concluded .

astana - on july <num>28</num>  , kazakhstani minister of health jaksylyk doskaliyev confirmed that there are <num>13</num>  cases of h1n1 flu virus infections in the country . 
government authorities are taking elaborate measures to limit its spread in kazakhstan . 
so far ,  all those who have come down with the flu are in the capital ,  but emergency operations centres have been set up in other major cities to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic . 
according to doskaliyev ,  no new cases of the flu have been registered since july <num>22</num>  , and six patients have already been removed from quarantine . 
he also revealed that kazakhstan will not restrict travel to countries where cases of h1n1 virus have been registered . 
he asserted that preventative measures are much better than prohibitive measures . 
the ministry of foreign affairs ,  however ,  announced that it sent letters to the ministry of tourism and sport and the kazakhstan tourist association requesting that they caution kazakhstani citizens not to plan travel to countries with an elevated risk in the near future . 
the ministry of health has proposed a plan to identify signs of flu directly on board incoming airline flights . 
minister doskaliyev said that a thermal imaging device at the arrival terminal will not be able to detect a child who has experienced a borderline increase in body temperature - that is ,  <num>37.1</num>  degrees celcius . 
he stated that laser thermometers are available for that purpose and that the ministry can acquire those more quickly with government approval .

kabul - nato and afghan officials said july <num>29</num>  that a new taliban code of military conduct that instructs fighters to limit suicide attacks and avoid killing civilians is a sham that does not reflect the true nature of the insurgents . 
entitled  " taliban <num>2009</num>  rules and regulations booklet ,  "  the code was released in may and distributed to fighters . 
it appears designed to affirm the authority of taliban leader mullah omar ,  and to present the movement as a credible military force based on ideals and not simply a loose collection of criminal bands . 
the code allegedly requires that  " any official ,  soldier ,  contractor or worker of the slave government "  who is captured  " cannot be attacked or harmed ,  "  according to al-jazeera . 
 " the decision on whether to seek a prisoner exchange or to release the prisoner with strong guarantees will be made by the provincial  [ taliban ]  leader .  "

it was the third explosion in the tajik capital during the previous week . 
the first two occurred on july <num>25</num>  and <num>26</num>  .

islamabad - the global fund granted pakistan us$25 million for the control of tuberculosis ,  national manager of the tb control programme  ( ntp )  dr noor baloch revealed on <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
the global fund to fight aids ,  tuberculosis and malaria is a performance-based funding mechanism established in <num>2002</num>  to provide significant amounts of new resources to allow developing countries to quickly increase treatment and prevention services to stem the spread of the diseases . 
in geneva ,  global funds executive secretary michel kazatchkine and pakistans health secretary khushnood akhtar lashari signed two grant agreements to secure high-quality anti-tb drugs and strengthen the tb drug management system in pakistan . 
the grants will expand the impact of health services and mobilise pakistani communities to fight tuberculosis through a new form of public / private partnership for health ,  baloch said . 
according to him ,  the bulk of the grant will be used to acquire half of pakistans need for anti-tb drugs through the global drug facility . 
marcela rojo ,  a global fund spokesperson ,  said that with previous fund financing ,  pakistan has detected more than <num>38,000</num>  tuberculosis cases ,  trained close to <num>2,700</num>  medical personnel and reached about a million people through community education programmes . 
these newly signed grants propose a major procurement of anti-tuberculosis drugs as well as an overhaul of the countrys drug management programme ,  which is expected to curtail the problem of tb in pakistan significantly .

presidential candidates take campaigns to kandahar
kandahar ,  afghanistan - the convoy of white 4x4 screeched past waving bystanders ,  halted in a plume of dust outside the shrine of the cloak of the prophet mohammad ,  and let out afghan presidential candidate dr abdullah abdullah . 
it was a moment of pure theatre . 
for more than two centuries afghan leaders have come here ,  afghanistans southern city of kandahar ,  to associate themselves with the prophet and solidify support . 
although he is half tajik ,  abdullah has been making inroads in the pashtun heartlands of southern afghanistan . 
although president hamid karzai remains the favourite to win thursdays presidential election ,  abdullah has risen above the <num>30</num>  other remaining candidates in the field and provided the only credible challenge to the incumbent
in the process he has secured himself a reputation as one of the next big figures in afghan politics . 
the extra support may help propel karzai past the <num>50.1</num>  percent of the vote he needs to win in the first round . 
he is even in talks with another presidential candidate ,  former finance minister ashraf ghani ,  who he has asked to be chief executive of his cabinet . 
ghani has so far declined . 
large swathes of the south and east of the country are too dangerous for election observers to venture into .

after that we went back out and we heard in total six other explosions until about <num>08</num>  : <num>30</num>  .
i had presumed that would mean people would be less keen to vote . 
i was wrong . 
we went to a secondary school ,  one of the mens voting centres . 
there were queues coming out of every room . 
they were all supporters of president hamid karzai . 
they came in large numbers to vote this morning ,  and they are expected to come all over the day . 
this is a very good change compared to the <num>2005</num>  election . 
dr abdullah ,  independent election committee public outreach officer in laghman province :  only two polling centres  ( in garuch and badpakh villages )  out of <num>128</num>  couldnt open . 
otherwise ,  the process is going smoothly in cities as well as in districts ,  he said . 
now the situation is calm and voting is underway .

uzbekistan gets credit it may not need to modernise irrigation system
the renovation of the irrigation network in two heavily populated districts in uzbekistan will begin this year . 
 ( photo by reuters / asmaa waguih ) 
tashkent - the asian development bank has given uzbekistan two loans worth us$15 million and <num>85</num>  $  million to renovate irrigation networks in the fergana and zarafshan valleys . 
the first loan is for <num>32</num>  years ,  the second for <num>26</num>  years . 
the renovations of the irrigation network in two heavily populated uzbek regions will begin later this year and should be completed in <num>2014</num>  .
due to be renovated are the narpai canal system in samarkand region and the besharyk system in fergana valley . 
currently ,  the canals are filled by water pumps that have long outlasted their useful life spans . 
this project is a matter of life and death . 
more than <num>90</num>  percent of the countrys agricultural crop comes from irrigated land ,  and poor irrigation leads to a loss of <num>15</num>  percent of the crops ,  asserted economist viktor ivonin . 
director of the russian institute of water issues viktor danilov-danikyants said that renovation of the irrigation networks in and of itself will change little . 
according to him ,  the entire irrigation system in place does not comply with modern standards . 
so much water is supplied for irrigation that as a result ,  it mixes with underground salt water and brings harmful salt to the surface . 
according to the ministry of agriculture and water ,  the area of salt-contaminated land has increased by <num>14</num>  percent over the last <num>10</num>  years ,  and now constitutes more than half of irrigated plantations . 
in samarkand region ,  erosion has claimed up to <num>80</num>  percent of the earth . 
director of the central asian transnational water coordinating committees scientific research centre viktor dukhovny believes that water metering is the solution . 
in three years ,  we reduced water intake from the south fergana canal from one billion cubic metres to <num>640</num>  million ,  and that was done without foreign credit ,  he said .

early in august ,  uzbekistan said that it would not begin negotiations until the debts had been paid . 
kyrgyzstan hopes to resolve the matter soon ,  and the prospects of winter and freezing weather provide an extra incentive . 
before the cold season sets in ,  kyrgyzstan would like to see a reduction in the current price of <num>240</num>  $  per thousand cubic metres of petroleum ,  to reflect the recent decrease in global energy commodity prices . 
kyrgyzgaz ceo salamat aitikeev promised that kyrgyzstan would settle its debts to uzbekistan in full by september <num>1</num>  .
according to official figures from kyrgyzgaz ,  the total number of petrol consumers in the country is <num>277,000</num>  , only <num>2,000</num>  of whom are not private citizens . 
most of the debt is carried not by citizens ,  but by state and private organisations and companies that together owe kyrgyzgaz more than us$14 million . 
to repay uzbekistan ,  kyrgyzgaz is carrying out mass corporate raids to collect debts and cut off non-payers . 
in addition to kyrgyzgaz employees ,  officers of law-enforcement agencies and journalists are also involved in the raids .

extortion by gangs flourishes in kyrgyzstan schools

kyrgyzstan - more than <num>40</num>  percent of parents say their children have informed them of extortion in kyrgyzstan schools . 
children from low-income families are most often are subjected to extortion . 
gangs generally avoid extortiong children of teachers ,  those with wealthy parents ,  and those who are physically strong . 
these are the dark conclusions of a study conducted by el pikir public opinion research center with financial support from the foundation for tolerance international . 
the research cited several reasons for the phenomenon ,  including the growth of the cult of money ,  alcoholism ,  parental divorce and polygamy ,  and ,  most significantly ,  the lack of proper family education . 
extortion in schools is directly tied to the growth of a criminal influence in the students' environment ,  in which prostitution ,  vagrancy ,  and drug addiction have appeared . 
experts stress that these problems are hushed up by principals and teachers . 
parents surveyed also said their students are fearful of teenage gangs . 
gulia abdrazakova said that her son goes to a private school because she is afraid to send him to a public school . 
there is a security service in the private school and children are driven home in a school bus . 
it turns out ,  she says ,  that she is paying for her child's safety from the gangs rather than his education . 
according to ninth-grade student muzafar iminov from osh ,  all schools in kyrgyzstan's major cities are now divided into spheres of influence between teenage criminal gangs . 
in his district ,  the  " patriot "  group keeps two district schools in fear . 
they compel children to pay protection money . 
experts believe timely reaction from the school administration at the first sign of extortion activity is critical to preventing it ,  as is conducting conversations with parents ,  teachers and schoolchildren about the problem and its consequences . 
experts also propose creating school security services as a preventive measure ,  which is costly and will detract from other educational expenditures .

kyrgyzstan - addressing the central asian regional breast cancer forum on september <num>3</num>  , acting general director of kyrgyzstan's national oncology centre ,  naken kasiyev ,  noted that breast cancer accounts for <num>15</num>  percent of all cancers diagnosed in the country . 
doctors claim that women living at high elevations are more prone to developing breast cancer . 
 ( photo by oleg lugovskiy ) 
data compiled by kyrgyzstan's health ministry show that around <num>440</num>  women each year are diagnosed with breast cancer . 
more than half of these patients die during the first stage of tumour growth . 
 " unfortunately ,  these patients include a large number of young women ,  which is cause for concern ,  "  kasiyev says . 
at the national oncology centre ,  medical experts believe that yearly mammograms should be mandatory for all women under the age of <num>40</num>  .
if the disease is allowed to progress to later stages without being detected ,  it nearly always proves fatal ,  since late-stage tumour growth is much more difficult to eradicate . 
in addition ,  poorly trained medical professionals in rural areas and a shortage of specialists have eroded women's confidence in doctors ,  and they tend seek medical help only when there is nowhere left to turn . 
pakistani religious minister shot and wounded
pakistan's religious affairs minister hamid saeed kazmi is carried into the back of a vehicle ,  moments after he was shot in the leg in islamabad on <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>2</num>  .

independent casualty estimates are unavailable . 
there had been expectations that the taliban would respond with attacks on cities ,  but the assassination attempt is the first attack since a suicide bomber killed nine people at a popular hotel in peshawar in june .

tajik environmentalists call on government to develop renewable energy resources
tajik environmentalists emphasise that measures to increase energy efficiency must be undertaken at the same time that alternative sources of power are brought on line to achieve energy independence . 
their statement highlights the necessity of revising existing standards for household electrical appliances ,  encouraging more widespread use of energy-saving technologies and providing tax incentives for their manufacture and supply . 
hakim akhmedov ,  an expert on renewable sources of energy ,  believes that developing alternate small-scale sources of power should be given the same priority as the construction of large hydroelectric plants in tajikistan .

housing in former soviet republics is least expensive in dushanbe
housing prices have dropped in practically all post-soviet republics this year . 
 ( photo by vladimir pavlenko / pressphotos via getty images ) 
tajikistan builders' association president faizali radzhabov does not foresee a further decrease in housing prices . 
in fact ,  housing in dushanbe will remain expensive because of the lack of investment in residential housing construction . 
out of more than <num>1,500</num>  construction companies in the republic ,  only <num>20</num>  are involved in the construction of residential housing . 
radzhabov also did not agree with ged analytics experts on the cost of housing in dushanbe . 
he asserted that a square metre of residential space in bedroom communities in the outskirts of dushanbe fluctuates between <num>500</num>  $  and <num>800</num>  $  , while in the centre of the city ,  the price can reach <num>1,500</num>  $  .
turkmenistan proposes compensation for water from tajikistan
a reservoir formed by the nurek hydroelectric power station on the river vakhsh in tajikistan . 
if the presidents proposal is adopted ,  tajikistan will receive joint compensation from its neighbours to help resolve its energy problems ,  in return for continuing to ensure adequate quantities of drinking and irrigation water . 
<num>1</num>  , tajikistan's parliament adopted a new law on the country's official language that requires all citizens to be able to speak in tajik . 
residency permits must now be filed out in the national language ,  and all spoken communication with authorities must be in tajik . 
meanwhile ,  the russian language is no longer the preferred language of communication between ethnic groups . 
while a previous law adopted in <num>1989</num>  gave citizens the right to choose their language of communication with government authorities ,  the tajik language is now the sole official language in tajikistan . 
on introducing the bill ,  parliamentary deputy dodikhudo saymuddinov noted that the new measure was supported by president emomali rakhmon in his annual address to parliament in spring <num>2009</num>  .
according to saymuddinov ,  the law will help streamline issues of governance and increase a sense of national identity and pride among tajiks . 
 " the law does not restrict the russian language . 
schools will continue to teach russian ,  just as they always have ,  "  he added . 
however ,  some elected representatives have attempted to delay the adoption of the new law . 
according to ismoil talbakov ,  more than <num>100,000</num>  organisations and businesses have their own legal stamp . 
 "  [ their ]  letterheads and seals are in russian and tajik . 
replacing these with tajik-only versions would cost a total of us$3 . 5 million ,  "  he says . 
the leader of tajikistan's communist party ,  parliamentary deputy shodi shabdolov is completely opposed to the new measure . 
he believes that the law may mean the loss of many qualified workers who do not speak tajik ,  and that its adoption could aggravate relations between tajikistan and russia . 
in fact ,  russia could react by eliminating visa-free travel between the countries ,  shabdolov believes . 
this measure was advocated by a number of russian politicians when the language bill was debated in tajikistan's parliament . 
the country has more than <num>3000</num>  elementary schools ,  of which only <num>30</num>  currently teach in russian . 
nearly all of these schools are in the capital city . 
in metropolitan areas ,  many parents go to great lengths to place their children in russian-language schools .

dushanbe will be the location of the largest mosque in central asia . 
 ( photo by reuters / nozim kalandarov ) 
at the constructions inauguration ,  tajikistans president emomali rakhmon expressed his hope that the mosque would become one of the grandest islamic centres of the world . 
the adnan safarini company from the united arab emirates is constructing the <num>7.5</num>  hectare complex with financing from the emir of qatar . 
it will also contain libraries ,  museums ,  halls for conferences and receiving guests ,  as well as rooms for a variety of events . 
the mosque will be decorated with a majestic minaret ,  seven ornate columns symbolising the seven stages of the world and seven gates to paradise ,  as well as numerous ponds and fountains . 
an islamic university will be built next to the mosque . 
the complex grounds will be shaped in the form of tajikistan ,  a feature the president of the republic insisted on . 
political analyst rustam samiyev claims that the islamic world has become increasingly interested in tajikistan because of the effectiveness of tajik authorities in increasing the role of islam in the country's social life . 
tajikistan has also held a series of events celebrating the birthdays of famous muslim cultural and theological figures . 
according to the new tajik law on religion ,  however ,  the sunni sect of islam is the primary religion in the republic . 
taliban ignore code of conduct ,  inflict maximum loss on civilians
since the release of the taliban code of conduct in july ,  hundreds of civilians have been killed in pakistan . 
the government delayed operations against the taliban in south waziristan ,  giving the insurgents enough time to reorganise and take revenge for baitullahs killing ,  shah said . 
according to him ,  after the successful operation in swat and malakand ,  the government should have immediately launched a fierce operation in south waziristan . 
security checkpoints at which police search vehicles are inadequate to reign in the furious terrorists ,  shah added . 
the taliban are involved in a number of kidnapping-for-ransom cases in karachi that negate one of the key principles of their coc ,  said haider abbas rizvi ,  the deputy parliamentary leader of the muttehida qoumi movement  ( mqm )  . 
killing of civilians and kidnapping for ransom by taliban indicate that they have no respect for human life and they deserve no leniency from the government . 
experts pointed out that despite the coc ,  the taliban carried out a number of suicide attacks against civilians . 
in first week of october alone ,  their attacks claimed the lives of almost <num>100</num>  civilians and injured dozens of others .

astana - uzbekistan will cease to be part of the central asian integrated power network on <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
the decision will put increased strain on the countries that are still in the network ,  and could lead to serious incidents . 
kazakh energy and mineral resources minister sawat mynbayev went further ,  saying that by continuing to cooperate with kyrgyzstan ,  kazakhstan is doing its neighbours an unbelievable favour . 
he said that the easiest thing for us would be to cut ourselves off from them and get through the winter without any problems . 
the kyrgyz government will soon try to convince uzbekistan that exiting the integrated network is not a prudent move ,  even from uzbekistans perspective . 
kyrgyz minister of industry and energy ilyas davydov has already visited tashkent to this end ,  but no agreement has yet been reached . 
al-qaeda in worst financial position in years
at the same time ,  the taliban in afghanistan and pakistan is thriving on the proceeds from poppy harvesting and the international drugs trade . 
treasury department assistant secretary david cohen said that in recent years the west had enjoyed success in cutting funding to al-qaeda . 
analysts warn ,  however ,  that attacks are not expensive . 
experts believe the world trade centre event cost about <num>500,000</num>  $  to plan and execute ,  the <num>2004</num>  madrid bombings <num>10,000</num>  $  , and the july <num>2005</num>  london attacks just a few thousand pounds . 
cohen said the taliban was in a much better financial position . 
the taliban also extorts money from poppy farmers and heroin traffickers and demands protection payments from afghan businesses .

volunteer migrants given land in southern tajikistan
the tajik national programme of voluntary migration aims to solve unemployment issues and eradicate poverty by equitably distributing human resources throughout the country . 
volunteers migrate not only from the country's southern districts ,  but also from the gorno-badakhshan autonomous province ,  where there is no developed industry and a shortage of arable land . 
people also come from remote areas of the sughd province in the north of the country . 
rustam yuldashev ,  a migrant from the vose district who has lived in the nosir khusrav district for more than six months ,  said that the district administration was trying to create the necessary infrastructure for everyday living . 
 " at first ,  it was difficult to get used to things ,  mainly because of the weather conditions . 
the migration programme will also cover the evacuation and relocation of <num>1200</num>  families from zones frequently afflicted by natural disasters . 
dozens arrested in syr darya ,  uzbekistan
human rights activists assert that uzbekistans fight against extremism has taken on the characteristics of a witch hunt .

reports differed on how many people were actually detained in the city of <num>30,000</num>  .
some sources cited <num>30</num>  , whereas human rights advocate karim bazarbayev told radio liberty that <num>70</num>  people were in police custody . 
according to him ,  most of those arrested were young adults and teenagers who attend religious services on a regular basis . 
human rights groups claim that the young men are suspected of involvement in the attempted assassination of tashkents senior imam ,  anvar-qori tursunov ,  and the killing of high-ranking police official khasan asadov . 
authorities have not confirmed these reports . 
asadov was second in command at the ministry of internal affairs central directorate for criminal investigation and anti-terrorism . 
he was shot five times at point-blank range in his apartment on <abbr>aug.</abbr>  <num>9</num>  .
police investigators have not divulged developments in the case ,  commenting only that possible motivations for the shooting may include the professional activities of the victim and his family . 
following this summers attacks ,  human rights groups began airing concerns that overzealous law enforcement agencies ,  seeing the hand of religious extremists in the assaults ,  would begin large-scale arrests . 
according to them ,  uzbekistan often brands the moderately faithful and a variety of troublemakers as extremist .

turkmenistan resumes natural gas supply to russia
gazprom headquarters in moscow . 
 ( photo by denis sinyakov / afp / getty images ) 
after the april <num>9</num>  pipeline explosion ,  turkmenistan and russia began tense negotiations on natural gas price and volume for the renewal of supplies . 
turkmenistan's economic health is directly linked to energy exports ,  with more than <num>90</num>  percent of state budget funds provided by natural gas ,  oil and petroleum product sales . 
for this reason ,  ashgabat has been unwilling to yield on its pricing . 
gazprom has a different problem altogether . 
a recent decrease in demand for natural gas has forced the company to back away from earlier commitments to purchase fixed amounts of gas from suppliers . 
in <num>2003</num>  , in a bid to remain the exclusive supplier of turkmen gas to the european market ,  gazprom inked a deal with the central asian country guaranteeing volume purchases over the next <num>25</num>  years . 
at this time ,  however ,  relying on russia to get its natural gas to market is no longer such an attractive prospect to turkmenistan's leadership ,  which is currently seeking to develop energy projects with china ,  iran and the european union . 
central asian journalists seek decriminalisation of slander and invective
the fact that journalists can be prosecuted for slander and invective makes it impossible for them to carry out media investigations ,  particularly those involving senior officials . 
almaty - journalists ,  lawyers and media experts from kazakhstan ,  kyrgyzstan and tajikistan held a roundtable on the decriminalisation of slander and invective in almaty at the end of october . 
participants included experts in the area of freedom of expression from the ukraine and russia and the british international organisation ,  article <num>19</num>  .
the event was organised by internews networks kazakh office and the local ngo internews-kazakhstan . 
kuzhukeeva stated that civil society organisations in these countries regularly seek to grant journalists immunity from being charged with crimes for these offences ,  but so far with little success . 
in kyrgyzstan ,  for example ,  there have been at least four attempts to make the relevant amendments to the penal code . 
in kazakhstan ,  despite some evidence of a general improvement ,  most legislative amendments in this area have been superficial . 
in discussing the criminal prosecution of journalists in tajikistan ,  former judge sayera yusupova said that they can be punished for slander and invective both under the civil and penal codes of tajikistan . 
furthermore ,  the penal codes of the three countries include articles protecting the president and government officials against unfavourable reporting by journalists . 
journalists maintain that the existence of such articles in the criminal code ,  and the fact that officials misuse them to deal with media coverage that makes them uncomfortable ,  constitutes unwarranted restrictions on the freedom of expression and prevent media from informing the public of actions by public officials that violate the publics trust .

 ( reuters / athar hussain ) 
islamabad - life is slowly returning to normal in pakistans swat valley ,  where some of the deadliest fighting against taliban militants occurred . 
it is the memory of that past that has some people reluctant to return home ,  however . 
residents of the swat valley were widely sceptical of the commitment and sincerity of the security forces before their rah-e-rast operation ,  but its successful implementation gradually eliminated their misgivings ,  as militants were driven away . 
the religious should now display courage to oppose the un-islamic tactics of extremists ,  said wajid ali khan ,  minister for environment ,  north west frontier province  ( nwfp )  . 
the people have learned that what the taliban did was immoral ,  inhuman and un-islamic ,  he said . 
 " people have also learned that it is dangerous to follow the extremists . 
they are now for issue-based politics and do not want religion to be used for political gains .  "

brief excerpts of his remarks were broadcast on state tv . 
 " i don't know why in this country it's not allowed to make any kind of criticism of you ,  "  said the student ,  wearing a long-sleeved blue polo shirt and appearing calm . 
during demonstrations ,  young protesters frequently chanted  " death to the dictator "   ( referring to khamenei )  and even  " khamenei is a murderer .  " 
scores of iranian writers ,  bloggers and academics have been jailed for writing what authorities have deemed as insults to khamenei . 
but so far vahidnia has been spared . 
the president of sharif university even defended him ,  saying he spoke within the law . 
during the face-to-face exchange ,  vahidnia also raised allegations of abuse of imprisoned opposition protesters .

islamabad - the shortage of water in pakistan has generated an internal crisis that must be resolved immediately ,  said dr shoaib ahmad ,  social scientist and visiting faculty member at the international institute of islamic economics ,  in islamabad on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>7</num>  .
according to statistics presented by ahmad ,  <num>142</num>  million acre-feet of water are produced annually by pakistans rivers . 
out of these ,  <num>104</num>  are diverted to canal systems . 
at the end of the day ,  after all losses ,  there are only <num>70</num>  million acre-feet of water available ,  a loss of <num>51</num>  percent of the supply ,  he said . 
besides water losses in conveyance systems ,  the opposition to large water storage projects is another critical factor adding to the depletion of water resources ,  he said . 
there is an immense need for political consensus…to address the water crisis in pakistan ,  adding ,  if we control these water losses ,  we can minimise shortages . 
panic in kyrgyzstan drives up antiviral prices
kyrgyzstan - panic over the increase in swine flu cases is gripping kyrgyzstan ,  where <num>32</num>  new cases were registered on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
despite calls by the government for calm ,  antiviral medicines and masks disappeared from pharmacy shelves in a matter of days . 
parliamentarians have asked the healthcare ministry and anti-monopoly committee to regulate the sale of masks and antiviral medications . 
general director tolon isakov of the healthcare ministrys health department said that more than <num>2.5</num>  million masks need to be supplied to kyrgyzstan by december . 
currently ,  the public is buying up the remaining masks at several times their original cost . 
we were only able to buy two masks . 
some of my friends bought <num>50</num>  .
the health department has instructed the managers of pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies to offer selections of medicines used to prevent and treat flu symptoms ,  to create a constant two-week supply and not raise prices . 
the state anti-monopoly committee will regulate price levels . 
if a pharmacy breaks these rules during the flu pandemic ,  it stands to lose its license . 
tamiflu ,  one of the best known anti-flu medicines ,  for example ,  currently sells for us$38 a package in kyrgyzstan ,  seven or eight times its original cost . 
the world health organisations representative in kyrgyzstan ,  oskon moldokulov ,  said that the public should not panic over tamiflu availability because the country will soon receive another <num>40,000</num>  packages . 
schools give up assemblies amid terror fears
schools and colleges ,  particularly military service academies and institutions of the defence housing authority  ( dha )  are taking extraordinary security measures to prevent attacks ,  as they are highly targeted by violent extremists ,  teachers said . 
dha schools have introduced transparent book bags ,  and students are receiving safety training in the wake of recent terrorist attacks . 
extra security guards have been hired and positioned on rooftops and at gates to provide maximum protection for the students ,  teachers said . 
for the first time in the history of pakistan ,  educational institutions were closed for a week in october when attacks by violent extremists in islamabad ,  rawalpindi and lahore intensified ,  noted sindh professors and lecturers association president muzaffar ali rizvi . 
four out of five kyrgyz women subjected to violence

un special rapporteur on violence against women rashida manjoo said that forced and underage marriages ,  human trafficking ,  police violence ,  domestic violence and gender-based discrimination are all practised in kyrgyzstan . 
the results of the study will be circulated nationwide as part of the national campaign <num>16</num>  days of efforts to tackle gender-based violence ,  which begins <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
<num>25</num>  , the international day for the elimination of violence against women . 
the initiative will include roundtable discussions ,  awareness campaigns and seminars on womens rights . 
transparency international finds corruption in central asia remains systemic
president of transparency international sylvia schenk . 
the highest ratings were awarded to new zealand  ( <num>9.4</num>  )  and denmark  ( <num>9.3</num>  )  . 
singapore and sweden each scored <num>9.3</num>  , while switzerland was rated <num>9.0</num>  .
the high cpi scores earned by these countries are indicative of their political stability and well-developed ,  robust public institutions . 
kazakhstan ,  which ranked highest for central asia ,  was rated <num>2.7</num>  , and was 120t on the list of <num>180</num>  nations cited in the report . 
while not particularly noteworthy ,  this compared favourably with the score of <num>2.2</num>  it achieved last year . 
the improvement may be attributed to the governments anti-corruption efforts as it prepares to become osce chairman in <num>2010</num>  , as kazakhstan claimed in a government press release on the cpi . 
the report states that kazakhstan is considered the strongest economy in the region . 
kazakhstans low cpi score indicates that corruption remains systemic ,  with the most problematic areas being the judiciary ,  police ,  customs ,  property rights ,  land registration and construction projects . 
they include sudan ,  iraq ,  myanmar ,  afghanistan and last-placed somalia . 
reaching out to students on violent extremism
islamabad - it is time to actively engage students in understanding the phenomenon of violent extremism ,  to enable them to play a role in steering pakistan out of the current crisis ,  asserted associate professor dr azam chaudhry of the national institute of pakistan studies  ( nips )  at quaid-i-azam university in islamabad on <abbr>nov.</abbr> <num>19</num>  .
we are organising student conferences and seminars for youth on violent extremism ,  a persistent and complex challenge that young people want to understand better than what is reported by the media ,  he said . 
reaching out to students on this issue is crucial ,  because among them you have tomorrows leaders and decision-makers . 
the students vowed to continue the process of educating themselves about the root causes of pakistans problems ,  and expressed their determination to play a role in bringing about the changes required to reduce the threats of violent extremism to society . 
people cannot be neutral about the matter ,  said irum jhatial ,  an nips student . 
society must be encouraged to develop an understanding of violent extremism and take a stand against it . 
kyrgyz journalists remember deceased colleagues
the publisher and editor-in-chief of the popular siesat weekly ,  alisher saipov ,  was murdered in <num>2007</num>  .
bakyt ibraimov ,  an expert with journalists ,  said the organisers had not expected such a large number of people to support the dinners ,  which drew more than <num>100</num>  journalists ,  editors ,  and owners of electronic and print media . 
the relatives and loved ones of the deceased journalists were also invited ,  including the father of alisher saipov ,  the editor of siesat who was killed in <num>2007</num>  by three shots fired at close range . 
also present was the younger brother of almaz tashiyev ,  beaten to death by police earlier this year . 
 " parliament will review iran's relations with countries that voted for the recent resolution against us ,  "  ali larijani ,  the speaker of parliament ,  was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . 
the latest statement appeared to sound the death knell for a deal with global powers that would see the bulk of iran's low-enriched uranium sent abroad for processing into solid fuel rods for a medical reactor . 
any expansion in enrichment activity would increase western fears that iran is considering the development of nuclear weapons ,  although iran says its programme is aimed purely at power generation . 
russia and china ,  both of which can veto un security council resolutions ,  appear increasingly prepared to support some tightening of sanctions as a last resort . 
however ,  prime minister vladimir putin ,  while declining to answer a question on sanctions on thursday ,  told reporters that russia had  " no information that iran is working on the creation of a nuclear weapon .  "

afghan militants lay down arms
former afghan taliban and other islamic militants offer prayers during a ceremony in kabul . 
in <num>2005</num>  , president karzai offered amnesty to militants in return for giving up violence . 
according to the head of the government-backed commission for strengthening peace in north afghanistan ,  wazir gul ,  <num>1,300</num>  militants have given up militancy this year . 
in late november ,  afghan president hamid karzai in his eid holiday message demanded co-operation towards stability from all our brothers who stand armed against their country<abbr>...</abbr> we will continue to invite them until peace and stability come to this country ,  he added . 
this is an initiative of the afghan people ,  and i wish mullah muhammad omar  [ taliban leader ]  and all other taliban recognise this necessity and join with us and participate in the reconstruction of their country . 
most of the taliban in my area are young men who need jobs ,  said hajji fazul rahim ,  a leader of the abdulrahimzai tribe that spans three eastern provinces . 
they need something to keep them busy . 
if we give them work ,  we can weaken the taliban . 
at a ceremony in early december in kabul ,  about <num>70</num>  insurgents laid down their guns before the commissioners and agreed to accept the afghan constitution . 
some of the men had fought for the taliban ,  and some for hezb-i-islami ,  another insurgent group . 
the fighters motives ranged from disillusionment to exhaustion .

 ( photo said salimov ) 
kazakhstan - shymkent ,  the administrative centre of south kazakhstan ,  was the third city in kazakhstan to host ,  on december <num>2</num>  , the first national travelling graffiti festival entitled never-ending designs . 
ornek . kz .  starting on october <num>31</num>  in almaty ,  the festival moved on to taraz the next day and to shymkent on december <num>2</num>  .
visits to taldykorgan and kapchagai followed . 
that is going to be our kazakhstani style . 
maksim gusev ,  a student at the symbat fashion academy in almaty and a participant artist in the festival ,  explained that it was this aspect which had aroused his interest in the idea . 
i wanted to show that there is a sub-culture ,  a separate art to which national themes could be applied . 
like other countries ,  kazakhstan now has its own style of graffiti . 
the drawing process is accompanied by hip-hop songs and dances . 
the designs ,  placed on walls in busy public areas should ,  according to the organisers ,  last for at least a few years . 
the national design has always occupied a particular place in the culture and art of the kazakhs . 
cultural experts say that it is the expression of the kazakhs' world view in symbols ,  a chronicle of the kazakh cultural ethnicity . 
even today ,  numerous everyday household articles ,  clothing and domestic interiors are decorated with the design . 
mongolia wins its first olympic gold
mongolia has won medals in wrestling ,  boxing ,  shooting and judo at previous games ,  but never gold . 
gundegmaa otryad won a silver medal in womens pistol shooting on wednesday . 
families in the isolated country of just <num>3</num>  million people ,  which lies sandwiched between china and russia ,  had gathered to watch the event . 
many in the capital said they would celebrate by downing vodka . 
it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition ,  said gerelt-od ,  <num>26</num>  , a construction worker . 
i and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news . 
it is going to be a very exciting night . 
in an apparent sign of reconciliation ,  enkhbayar shook hands with the chairman of the opposition party ,  the mongolian democratic party ,  in the square before the two sang the national anthem together . 
new fighting in the caucasus marks the fourth anniversary of the beslan tragedy
<num>1</num>  , <num>2004</num>  was to be the first day of classes at beslans number one school ,  and returning students in grades two through <num>12</num>  had gathered ,  along with parents ,  family members and teachers ,  to mark the occasion . 
minutes later some <num>32</num>  armed men and women jumped from the back of a truck firing their rifles and shouting allahu akhbar . 
russias initial response to the attack followed classic patterns for similar hostage situations . 
by the second afternoon of the siege a number of children and adult hostages were showing signs of serious physical distress . 
on russian insistence ,  the terrorists released <num>26</num>  nursing women and their infants . 
the terrorists began to deny the hostages water and trips to the toilet ,  and fired at surrounding security forces ,  setting a police vehicle on fire . 
while the russians initially held back from returning fire ,  they failed to establish any real dialogue with the attackers . 
<num>100</num>  pro-taliban seminaries could create anarchy in karachi
karachi - more than <num>100</num>  pro-taliban seminaries  ( madrasas )  in karachi have the potential to create anarchy in the city to avenge military operations in north-west frontier province  ( nwfp )  ,  police officials said . 
officials said that at present <num>870</num>  seminaries are operating in karachi of which more than <num>100</num>  are believed to support the taliban and provide them with training ,  shelter and money . 
faisal sabzwari ,  the youth affairs minister in sindh and the deputy parliamentary leader of the muttahida quami movement  ( mqm )  ,  said the mqm has informed the federal and the provincial governments about the pro-taliban activities of those seminaries in karachi and has sought action against them . 
sabzwari pointed out that on several occasions tehrik-e-taliban pakistan  ( ttp )  spokesman mullah omar has himself told media that hundreds of ttp supporters were present in karachi and prepared to create trouble in the city on the order of ttp chief baitullah mahsud . 
mqm said that hundreds of foreign and local pro-taliban students were being trained in the seminaries under the guise of religious education ,  and that the seminaries were providing weapons and financial support to the taliban in karachi . 
the sindh government is monitoring the activities of seminaries ,  said waqar mehdi ,  media coordinator and spokesman for the chief minister of sindh . 
the government has begun requiring the registration of seminaries ,  and will take action against those involved in terrorism ,  he added . 
the government has taken security measures to preempt terrorist activities in the province ,  especially in karachi ,  mehdi said . 
a recent intelligence report revealed that <num>1,248</num>  seminaries are functioning in sindh province with <num>258,000</num>  students ,  including <num>5,000</num>  foreigners . 
a few years ago about <num>12,000</num>  foreign students were being educated in seminaries in sindh ,  mehdi said . 
that number fell to <num>5,000</num>  as the government expelled those involved in terror-related activities . 
social innovation brings sanitation to slums
in <num>1980</num>  , akhtar hameed khan created the orangi pilot project in order to help improve sanitation in karachis sprawling squatter settlements . 
he saw that poor sanitation was one of the key reasons for ill health and much could be done to help combat such problems . 
karachi is the largest city in pakistan with a population estimated at <num>12</num>  million . 
over the past three decades ,  the citys population has grown exponentially . 
when karachi found itself in the middle of a sewage crisis ,  khan decided it was time to do something about it . 
nearly thirty years later ,  the orangi pilot project has become one of pakistans most successful social development projects and is replicated all across the world . 
the project is named after the orangi area of karachi . 
with approximately one million inhabitants ,  it is the largest squatter settlement in the city . 
in the early <num>1960</num>  second  ,  the first squatters came and settled in the area . 
at that time ,  the pakistani government had only constructed main roads ,  a water supply network ,  electricity lines and a few schools and hospitals . 
there was no sewage system for orangi residents and most households used bucket latrines and soak pits for the disposal of human waste . 
for the disposal of waste water ,  they used open sewers that resulted in a high rate of water-borne diseases . 
khan envisioned bringing slum dwellers together so they could determine what their living areas lacked and then turn to his organisation to borrow funds and to receive technical assistance on how to properly install infrastructure projects . 
orangi not only provides social and technical guidance to a number of community initiatives ,  but also encourages partnerships between the people and governments . 
the orangi pilot project supports initiatives that involve using local resources and funds . 
the project that began outside karachi has assisted in the design of sewage systems ,  and sanitation and drinking water initiatives run by local residents in over <num>15</num>  pakistani neighbourhoods . 
the project has loaned thousands of dollars to help low-cost housing initiatives become a success . 
it has also assisted with the maintenance of over <num>650</num>  schools and the creation of hundreds of small businesses and dozens of medical clinics . 
last year ,  pakistan reached a milestone as a majority of its population now lives in urban rather rural areas . 
and nearly a third of city dwellers live in squatter housing ,  with many living in conditions which lack proper infrastructure such as drinking water and sewage disposal . 
hence ,  the orangi pilot project plays an incredibly vital role . 
hundreds of development practitioners from all across the world ,  including asian development bank officials and doctoral candidates in development from the frankfurt school of economics ,  have visited pakistan to study the orangi model . 
the project is run almost entirely by full-time pakistani employees . 
the organisation is always seeking interns and employees and salaries range from a small monthly stipend of <num>5,000</num>  pakistani rupees  ( us$120 )  to higher .

kazakhstan has cottoned on to melons

due to water shortages in kazakhstan's south ,  cotton bolls are dropping off the plants before even ripening . 
irina kazorina of fergana . 
ru reports that there is no longer any hope for a big harvest this year . 
cotton was planted over <num>110,000</num>  hectares in the makhtaaral district of the south kazakhstan province . 
proper irrigation remains a problem . 
out of the necessary <num>100</num>  cubic metres per second of water flow in the dostyk irrigation channel ,  only <num>20</num> -<num>75</num>  cubic metres per second of water flowed throughout the growing period . 
just a third of the cotton sown was properly watered ,  and <num>30,000</num>  hectares went without any water at all . 
a project of the asiatic bank met with a similar fate two years ago in the very same makhtaaral district . 
along with other problems ,  the project's wells did not function-due to high energy costs . 
farmers struggling to make payments on their credits were not able to pay for the cost of electricity . 
according to the company representative ,  the processing centre has been outfitted with imported equipment to conform to the standards of european retailers . 
the equipment includes a tunnel that cools the melons and a gas chamber to spray the produce with fitomag . 
 " farmers won't reap any benefits from their harvests unless their agricultural products meet export criteria . 
the european union has exacting specifications for their food products . 
melons should be specially processed ,  packaged in european-specified packaging materials and transported in refrigerator cars kept to a specific temperature . 
even the volume and weight of every melon must meet specifications ,  "  myrzashol director kanat pilatov said . 
according to pilatov ,  the myrzashol processing centre works with more than <num>500</num>  local farms . 
besides melons ,  the centre procures other agricultural products from farmers . 
promises for three years
after they acquainted themselves with the financial plans the deputies were disturbed by the fact that the government is steadily lowering the plan limits for the budget ,  which stubbornly calculates prices at <num>60</num>  $  a barrel . 
they wondered . 
the articles on revenue and expenses in budget assets caused the greatest concern among the peoples elected members .

in addition ,  the birth rate grew and the population increase exceeded the decrease . 
the number of births totaled <num>305,100</num>  , up <num>17,900</num>  from the same period of last year . 
a significant increase in the birth rate is seen in andizhan and namangan regions ,  as well as karakalpakia . 
the birth rate in tashkent and bukhara region remains low . 
migration in the first six months of the year dropped by <num>13,900</num>  compared with <num>27,300</num>  in the same period of <num>2007</num>  , according to preliminary figures . 
in the first half of <num>2008</num>  , <num>97,700</num>  marriages and <num>9,100</num>  divorces were registered . 
the government forecast population growth as well as the fact that ,  primarily ,  this growth would affect the younger generation . 
that is why the government education program for <num>2004</num> -<num>2009</num>  was adopted in <num>2004</num>  and is being implemented today . 
according to the ministry of education press service ,  overall the education development program envisions fundamentally updating engineering and communications infrastructure and the complete modernization of <num>8,476</num>  schools ,  or <num>87</num>  percent with <num>2.9</num>  million available student seats . 
in the past few years alone ,  construction maintenance work was conducted at <num>4,669</num>  general schools . 
a total of <num>205</num>  new school buildings were built ,  <num>1,174</num>  schools were completely modernized ,  <num>2,074</num>  were completely renovated ,  and maintenance was performed at <num>1,216</num>  schools . 
about <num>453</num>  $  million was spent on this work out of the education fund . 
of the educational institutions opened since <num>2004</num>  , <num>3,768</num>  or <num>80.6</num>  percent are located in rural regions ,  <num>120</num>  or <num>2.6</num>  percent are located in hard-to-reach mountainous districts ,  and <num>781</num>  or <num>16.8</num>  percent are located in cities . 
all of the schools included in the education program are ready for the new school year . 
over the next two years well see changes in the other educational institutions as well ,  education minister gairat shoumarov said . 
by the first bell ,  <num>243</num>  textbook titles with total circulation of more than <num>16</num>  million copies had been published . 
thus ,  the provision of textbooks and study materials to schoolchildren is currently <num>97.3</num>  percent . 
a total of <num>5.2</num>  million children are attending general schools in uzbekistan in the new school year . 
more than <num>491,000</num>  schoolchildren entered the first grade on <abbr>sept.</abbr>  <num>2</num>  .
serious problems due to the lack of electricity are not only occurring in homes ;  businessmen are also agitated and are cursing civil servants and their colleagues . 
in accordance with the laws of physics ,  without electricity manufacturing and other types of equipment shut down and work grinds to a halt in offices ,  factory floors ,  workshops ,  cafes ,  restaurants and hairdressers salons . 
what is more ,  these power disruptions frequently happen right in the middle of the day . 
as a result of being unable to operate in normal conditions ,  some entrepreneurs have either scaled back their activity considerably or downed tools completely and moved their equipment to other ,  more prosperous countries . 
hundreds and thousands of kyrgyzstanis have been left without work . 
the idea of buying foreign electricity was previously dismissed out of hand . 
for instance ,  a press release issued by the kyrgyz ministry of industry ,  energy and fuel resources stated that importing electricity is not possible at present ;  our neighbours are themselves experiencing shortages in winter ,  and water shortages have affected not only kyrgyzstan but also all other countries of the central asian region .

the monthly print run is several thousand copies . 
this is an impressive figure since the weekly print run of all other informational publications in kyrgyzstan averages between <num>5,000</num>  and <num>10,000</num>  copies . 
independent journalist sakhira hazarova says :  readers need these kinds of publications ,  because in regular newspapers youll never find such a wealth and variety of material about human rights . 
social questions and problems connected with human rights arent popular among editors of traditional media . 
if this kind of material appears at all ,  then its usually scandalous ,  with no analysis of the situation . 
but when it does ,  i read it from start to finish . 
im impressed by the journalists independent views . 
asked whether editors feel pressure from the authorities over their critical material ,  babakulov said :  we always feel pressure . 
and ,  strange to say ,  were used to it . 
frankly speaking ,  though ,  the situation with freedom of speech in kyrgyzstan is getting worse . 
the countrys leadership is trying to use tax inspections to take control of private newspapers and those that have been given grants . 
these kinds of developments cant help but worry us . 
 [ but ]  unlike other publications ,  the authorities cant just up and close us down . 
for now ,  vof is among the very few non-government sources of information in the country . 
the newspaper is sucessfully examining the official press releases of law enforcement agencies ,  prosecutors and courts-filling its pages with non-official opinions all its own .

oil duty causes setbacks
the kazakh deputy minister for industry and trade ,  janar aitjanova ,  said that the current practice of levying customs duty on exports of crude oil has been a stumbling block for talks on the countrys entry to the world trade organisation  ( wto )  . 
our european partners have not reacted positively to the imposition of a duty on crude oil exported to member states of the european union  ( eu )  ,  aitjanova noted . 
according to ministry data ,  crude oil currently accounts for <num>70</num>  percent of the nations exports . 
aitjanova pointed out that duty on oil exports was intended to stimulate oil refinement in the country . 
to offset export duties ,  she called on european companies to invest in kazakhstans oil refinery sector . 
this issue is the main reason why our talks with the eu on entry into the wto have not come to fruition ,  the deputy minister concluded . 
customs duty on oil exports was introduced in kazakhstan last <abbr>may.</abbr> 
at present ,  it amounts to <num>203.80</num>  $   [ usd ]  per tonne ,  while payers of the so-called rent tax on oil exports are charged <num>27.43</num>  $  per tonne . 
duty is calculated according to a formula based on global oil prices ,  and is payable on all oil exports except those under contracts with provisions on the stability of the customs regime . 
government promotes vaccination campaign
a young girl affected by floods being vaccinated against measles in khurmastan village ,  in the khuzdar district of balochistan . 
to emphasise the importance of vaccination ,  the minister recently held a press conference where she administrated polio vaccine to a dozen children . 
we are happy to be teaming with the world health organisation in an upcoming polio vaccination campaign ,  said rehman . 
in sindh province ,  a committee has been established to help ensure that there are enough health workers able to administer vaccinations in troubled areas securely . 
similar committees are being established elsewhere in the country except in swat where unrest has grown considerably . 
pakistani health officials have reached out to religious leaders in swat for their support but the taliban presence in the area has made carrying out the vaccination campaign difficult despite evidence of local support for it . 
rehman has pledged that when the security situation improves ,  health workers will be sent to swat . 
cases of polio have been found in all four pakistani provinces this year with the highest number in the northern frontiers and fata ,  which have reported <num>40</num>  percent of the cases . 
the effects of global financial meltdown on tajikistan's economy
 '  ' the most likely risk scenario for domestic banks and private citizens arises from exchange rates-fluctuations that can directly affect money held in foreign currencies ,  '  ' fatkhuddinova said . 
 '  ' during the period from january to september <num>2008</num>  , the share of bank deposits in foreign currency was <num>64.8</num>  percent ,  while local currency accounts were <num>35.2</num>  percent of the total .  '  ' 
financial specialist bakhrom sharipov believes the main effect of the global financial crisis will be a tightening of bank lending on the domestic market . 
 '  ' in other words ,  risk-prone manufacturing sectors will receive credit on stricter lending terms and in smaller amounts ,  '  ' he said . 
tajikistan's economic minister ,  gulomdzhon bobozod ,  believes the global financial crisis may impact tajikistan's foreign trade and the country's economic development . 
 '  ' foreign trade is equal to or even greater than gdp ,  and is projected to reach <num>4.7</num>  $  billion  [ usd ]  this year ,  '  ' he said . 
tajikistan's gold reserves can cover two months of the country's imports . 
 '  ' so it's clear that we need to find solutions to the following tasks :  providing macroeconomic and social stability ,  improving job security and modernising the nation's economy .  '  ' 
student and teacher exchange programmes between colleges in kyrgyzstan and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  are very popular . 
another example of kyrgyz-american educational cooperation is the american university of central asia  ( auca )  . 
this university arose on the basis of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  studies department in the kyrgyz national state university ,  and over time has become a leading university not only in central asia . 
students from the region ,  as well as jordan ,  china ,  egypt ,  iran ,  afghanistan ,  pakistan ,  and mongolia study at this university . 
in <num>2007</num>  the total number of foreign students numbered more than <num>11,000</num>  .
at auca ,  teaching is done similarly to other <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  colleges ,  where the student is given maximum freedom in terms of choice of lectures and training courses . 
i like the american system of education ,  says sherzod atabayev ,  a student at the osh state university . 
my dream is to go the united states to study . 
i hope that it will all happen for me this year .

afghanistan wins prestigious international trade award
director of epaa sayed suliman fatimie told reporters ,  afghanistan won first place among the <num>10</num>  least developed countries . 
it is the first time that an afghan organisation has received such an honour . 
we have removed the two percent export tax ,  stopped illegal tax collection on our highways ,  launched <num>14</num>  national and international trade fairs ,  and found foreign markets for afghan products . 
this is why we received the award ,  fatimie said . 
afghanistan received the honour at the 7th conference of the world trade promotion organisation ,  which took place in holland this year . 
the epaa was established in <num>2006</num>  by the ministry of commerce and industry to facilitate the export and marketing of afghanistans products ,  and help afghan businessmen get their products into global markets . 
by improving trade facilities for businessmen ,  and with the cooperation of the organisation ,  we hope to increase exports <num>10</num>  percent more this year . 
carpets ,  dried and fresh fruits and handicrafts are afghanistans main export goods . 
vital afghan trade route links north and south
parwan province - enormous lorries painted in bright colours and decorated with gaudy tin cut-outs lumber up the switchbacks bumper to bumper . 
toyota corrollas dart in and out ,  passing the lorries on blind curves and in dark tunnels . 
this is the salang pass ,  the lifeline between afghanistans northern provinces and the rest of the country . 
ive been over it at least a thousand times ,  says mohammed atif ,  an engineer who worked on the road crossing the salang during taliban times . 
amin ,  a lorry driver eating lunch on the north side of the pass ,  says his business relies upon it . 
it is the only way . 
the salang pass cuts through the hindu kush mountains ,  enabling trade and transport between the commercial centres of northern afghanistan and kabul . 
the road crests at <num>3,878</num>  metres and passes through a series of tunnels . 
originally built by the soviets in <num>1964</num>  , it was considered an engineering marvel at the time . 
years of fighting and neglect ,  however ,  damaged the road and the tunnels ,  but afghans have doggedly repaired it and kept the pass open over the years . 
this road is absolutely necessary for business and development in afghanistan ,  says atif . 
kyrgyzstan to privatise national railroad
omurkulov said he was well informed about the situation with the kyrgyz railway as he worked in the industry for more than six years . 
according to him ,  the railroad industry was never unprofitable . 
some analysts feel that ,  based on the experiences of other countries ,  it is inadvisable for such a strategic sector as the transport industry to be completely privatised . 
they believe that it is best for the railroad to be incorporated with the state holding a majority stake . 
according to experts ,  rail carriers have already been incorporated with good economic results in all cis countries except kyrgyzstan and turkmenistan . 
furthermore ,  the rail service industry is generally thought to be unattractive to investors . 
it requires substantial investments ,  which are not as quickly recoverable as ,  for instance ,  the building industry . 
investors are more likely to look at the real estate market where a <num>500,000</num>  $  investment may generate considerable profit ,  while investment in the railway would require <num>10</num>  $  million or so . 
the fact that it belongs to the state also deters investors . 
yet ,  as the company requires additional financing ,  it has been keeping the door open for potential investors and international financial institutions . 
moreover ,  kyrgyz national railway director almaz rysmendiyev says the most significant problems the system has to contend with are substantial delays of trains and violations of passengers rights when trains enter kazakhstan and russia . 
he said that solutions to these problems are under consideration by government agencies that will reduce conflicts between railway personnel and police ,  by basing resolutions on relevant legislation and intergovernmental agreements . 
earlier this year ,  the kyrgyz national railway introduced an innovation in international train travel by having a group of lawyers aboard trains to russia . 
according to passengers ,  this innovation assisted considerably in protecting kyrgyz citizens rights and interests and reduced the number of unwarranted inspections and fees levied by a variety of government agencies during the journey .

importers of used cars in kyrgyzstan are left without buyers . 
kyrgyzstan - at the beginning of the year ,  customs duties on imported cars were increased in kyrgyzstan . 
the customs duty on the same car before the end of the year was <num>360</num>  $  .
the amount of new customs duties over the old will be based on year of manufacture and engine capacity of vehicles . 
the highest rates of duty will be charged on cars manufactured before <num>1997</num>  , which may be as much as five or six times higher than the rates on newer ones . 
cars are not manufactured in kyrgyzstan ,  so all cars are used vehicles imported from germany ,  south korea ,  japan and the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  the transport and sale of used vehicles therefore became very lucrative for small and mid-sized businesses . 
he laments that as a result he has already lost many potential buyers . 
according to state customs committee chairman nurlan akmatov the government is regulating ,  not prohibiting ,  the importation of automobiles . 
according to customs committee information ,  half of the imported vehicles in recent years were manufactured in the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  and their technical condition is a threat both to the environment and to citizens . 
the countrys main traffic safety administration is also lobbying to prohibit the importation of cars with steering wheels on the right .

he added that similar agreements had been signed with russia .

tashkent - the board of directors of the islamic development bank has approved a us$52 . 65 million loan to restore irrigation canals in the drought-ridden dzhizak and syrdarya regions in southern uzbekistan . 
the <num>79</num>  $  million project will begin this summer . 
more than half of the <num>4</num>  million hectares of irrigated land in uzbekistan was salinized during the soviet era because of over cultivation . 
after gaining independence ,  however ,  the uzbek government decided to restore fertility to that land to grow feed crops . 
under the government programme ,  <num>350,000</num>  hectares of land will be restored to fertility ,  more than <num>3,500</num>  kilometres of irrigation canals built and more than <num>1,000</num>  irrigation wells drilled . 
to avoid repeating the mistakes made by soviet irrigators ,  the salt water will be channelled to special reservoirs through the <num>7,600</num>  kilometres of drainage networks to be built under the programme .

almaty-the newly formed parents' emergency committee estimates that <num>200,000</num>  college students in kazakhstan are experiencing difficulties making tuition fee payments and are at risk of expulsion . 
today kazakhstan has <num>600,000</num>  students in its colleges and universities ,  with <num>83</num>  percent paying for their education . 
the committee's action group blames the crisis on tuition fees ,  which they consider unreasonably high given the current financial situation . 
at present ,  annual tuition fees average between us$1 , 000 and <num>1,600</num>  $  .
students' parents are asking the government to step in to defer tuition fee payments or provide loans from the samruk kazyna fund for national prosperity . 
according to committee member olga urazbekova ,  a wave of expulsions would not only mean interruptions in students' education ,  but contribute to possible social unrest as well . 
the government has pledged to look into the students' plight and has asked parents to remain calm . 
deputy education minister kulyash shamshitdinova reassured anxious parents that students will be permitted to defer tuition fees ,  although payment schedules are to be drawn up at the discretion of each college or university . 
tax breaks for employers might also encourage them to provide tuition money to train potential future workers .

the escape happened just hours after he was captured following his successful jailbreak on march <num>23</num>  .
the strangest part of the story ,  however ,  is that the inmates escapes occurred only a few days before he was up for release . 
abdraimov was to be released on parole in early april ,  but the teenager decided to take matters into his own hands and commute his sentence by escaping . 
according to the department of corrections in kyrgyzstans justice ministry ,  abdraimovs common law wife is expecting a child any day ,  and this might explain the inmates unusual behaviour .

jukneviciene said other issues discussed with tajik government officials included the social and economic situation in the country ;  eu aid of <num>66</num>  million euro  ( us$87 million )  provided under its strategy for central asia ;  and <num>15.5</num>  million euro  ( us$20 . 4 million )  allocated for a food programme to surmount the global financial crisis and implement energy projects . 
since the european commission opened its office in tajikistan ,  the eu has provided more than <num>155</num>  million euro  ( us$204 . 5 million )  in aid to tajikistan through its humanitarian agency echo . 
member of tajikistans lower house of parliament shodi shabdolov said the prosecutor generals office and state financial monitoring and corruption agency are investigating the use of government money ,  loans ,  and grants . 
public organisations and trade unions do not have the capacity to track their activities owing to the absence of government transparency .

the pamir mountains ,  a dream destination not only for climbers but also for cyclists . 
dushanbe - on april <num>27</num>  , tajikistan will issue a tourist visa which will allow visitors to travel in the country for <num>45</num>  days .

international committee to investigate power outage in central asia

 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ) 
astana - a failure in the unified energy system of central asia left almaty and zhambyl regions of kazakhstan and parts of northern kyrgyzstan without power . 
nonetheless ,  the ministry said there were no extreme situations that required emergency services in the city . 
power was restored in downtown almaty three and a half hours later . 
according to a statement by kegoc ,  a kazakh energy company ,  an international committee from the energia dispatch centre is being set up that will include representatives from kyrgyzstan ,  kazakhstan ,  uzbekistan and tajikistan to determine the cause of the accident and its impact . 
the power outage was just more proof of problems with the supply of electrical power to almaty ,  kazakhstans largest city with a population of <num>1.5</num>  million . 
the city has just two central heating and power plants that cover less than half of the southern capitals need for electricity with power generated in the country . 
the rest is purchased from the zhambyl hydroelectric plant in neighbouring kyrgyzstan . 
the government is banking on completion of a gas pipeline in <num>2010</num>  from western kazakhstan to china that will increase gas supply to almaty fourfold . 
the pipeline ,  the government hopes ,  combined with the completion of five substations in the city and the modernisation of the existing heat and power plants ,  will solve the citys power problems .

dushanbe - tajikistan will stop using incandescent light bulbs by <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
tajik residents will soon be compelled to replace burned out incandescent bulbs with energy-saving ones that use less electricity ,  cause less damage to the environment and last longer . 
he also announced that the government would provide new bulbs to more than <num>240,000</num>  poor families . 
the state energy holding company barki tochik noted that while energy-saving bulbs are <num>10</num>  times more expensive than incandescent bulbs ,  that cost will be entirely offset by decreased usage of electricity needed to power them and their long life . 
but independent expert abdullo kurbonov is sceptical about a achieving a complete ban on the use of incandescent bulbs . 
he cited a british association of dermatologists study that claims energy-saving bulbs can be harmful to people with photosensitive skin . 
the study also said the strong light from the energy-saving bulbs can aggravate skin conditions and trigger migraines in epileptics .

karachi-pakistan has seen trade with afghanistan and india significantly decline over the past months in the wake of growing tension at its borders and increased terrorist activities . 
between last november and february ,  pakistans monthly exports to afghanistan decreased to us$66 million from previous monthly levels of more than <num>100</num>  $  million . 
state bank of pakistan data show that last july pakistans exports to afghanistan reached <num>137</num>  $  million . 
between <num>2005</num>  and <num>2008</num>  , following the deployment of nato forces in kabul ,  afghanistan became a major buyer of pakistani products . 
before then ,  pakistans annual exports to the land-locked country totalled only <num>250</num>  $  million a year . 
in <num>2007</num>  , pakistans exports to afghanistan reached <num>680</num>  $  million and last year surged to <num>1.03</num>  $  billion ,  the highest ever level . 
foreign trade experts said the deployment of more than <num>24,000</num>  allied troops in the war-torn country brought increased trade with pakistan but the recent involvement of pakistani forces in military operations against taliban in border areas has led to suicide bombings in the country . 
militants are also targeting the cargo vehicles transporting pakistan exports to afghanistan for nato forces there ,  which has cut exports significantly . 
pakistans trade with india has also declined steadily in recent months . 
between october <num>2008</num>  and february this year monthly exports to india dropped to between <num>17</num>  $  million and <num>23</num>  $  million ,  while a year earlier monthly exports were valued between <num>35</num>  $  million to <num>58</num>  $  million . 
imports from india have also declined to <num>51</num>  $  million in february ;  the figure stood at <num>188</num>  $  million a year earlier . 
the mumbai terror attacks last november strained political and diplomatic ties between the countries and had a direct negative effect on their bilateral trade .

at the end of the <num>1990</num>  second  ,  tabligh began to expand its activities to central asian countries as well . 
in recent years ,  tajik authorities have toughened the regulation of religious activity . 
in the opinion of many experts ,  religious freedom has been substantially restricted in <num>2009</num>  as a result of amendments to legislation expanding those regulations .

in the neighbouring lower dir district ,  the scene of the april <num>25</num> -<num>26</num>  fighting ,  the military said that at least <num>47</num>  people ,  mostly militants ,  had been killed . 
the fighting pits militants against the frontier corps paramilitary police unit backed by army helicopter gun-ships and artillery . 
the district had been cleared of militants ,  according to acting interior ministry chief rehman malik ,  but residents said clashes were still taking place . 
lower dir bridges the mountains between swat and the afghan border . 
pakistani officials fear the route could be used to move taliban fighters from mountain bases near the afghan border to within striking distance of pakistan's plains ,  where most of its <num>170</num>  million people live and its industry is concentrated . 
pakistani media reported that as many as <num>20,000</num>  people had fled the fighting in lower dir . 
a senior official said only women ,  children and elderly men were being allowed to leave the district to keep taliban fighters from slipping out with the refugees . 
 " we can have no agreements with the government because it is not a government for pakistani people . 
it is a government for the americans "  ,  said muslim khan ,  a spokesman for the taliban in swat . 
almaty media forum held against backdrop of persecution of independent press
a group of kazakh editors has requested a meeting with president nazarbayev to discuss restrictions limiting press freedom . 
 ( photo by afp / getty images ) 
on the opening day of the forum yermurat bapi ,  editor of independent newspaper taszhargan ,  was sent to prison for five days for failing to pay kazakh parliamentarian romin madinov us$200 , 000 in libel damages . 
madinov was offended by an article in bapis newspaper that the editorial staff refused to retract . 
bapi said he has been forced to suspend publication of the newspaper indefinitely because of continued persecution by the kazakh authorities and to avoid putting journalists and the newspapers partners at risk with law-enforcement agencies . 
the court ,  she added ,  could consider his failure to pay as malicious disregard for a court ruling ,  an offense that carries a prison sentence of three years . 
so bapi could become the fourth journalist to be sentenced to prison in kazakhstan . 
the day before the media forum a group of kazakh editors and human rights activists requested a meeting with president nazarbayev to discuss the laws on mass media and the persecution of certain newspapers and their editors . 
attitudes towards international humanitarian law may be changing in turkmenistan
for many years ,  turkmenistan was ruled by totalitarian leader turkmenbashi who steered the nation on a course of total isolation . 
little changed since his death ,  but no matter how small those changes were ,  they were a breath of fresh air for the country . 
 ( photo by str / afp / getty images ) 
twenty one teams contending for the honorary title of legal scholar took part in the event . 
all four students on the turkmen team had undergone training at the turkmenistan red crescent national society to enhance their competitiveness . 
students were expected to demonstrate knowledge of the seven principles of international humanitarian law :  voluntary service ,  respect for humanity ,  neutrality ,  independence ,  impartiality ,  unity ,  and universality . 
in one of the games ,  young men and women with red crosses on their armbands were supposed to exhibit the appropriate attitude towards a wounded fighter in the midst of military action . 
although the turkmen students were not among the prize-winners ,  the team earned the judges' praise and was recognised for its potential . 
some believe that the fact the turkmen team was permitted to go abroad and participate in a human rights related event may indicate that official attitudes towards international humanitarian law in turkmenistan are beginning to change .

the parliamentarians also called for eliminating sleeper cells in other parts of the country .

more than <num>500</num>  kyrgyz from nearby towns subsequently gathered to express their anger . 
both kyrgyz and uzbek officials travelled to the scene of the incident to investigate the circumstances . 
on may <num>16</num>  , the deputy governor of uzbekistans fergana province issued an apology to the people of kyrgyzstan and assured them that he would alert his countrys government to what had happened . 
a number of kyrgyz border guards nonetheless stationed themselves in the kyzyl-kiya region to prevent conflict between kyrgyz and uzbeks and to contain any adverse events in the wake of the incident . 
citing calls from inhabitants of the village of tayat in kyrgyzstans batken province ,  they asked for the uzbek border outpost located in the area to be removed ,  but the uzbek authorities have refused to do so . 
uzbek border guards are reported to have stepped up security ,  and officers from the sokh border region and an assault battalion stationed in the enclave have been deployed to border checkpoints .

the registration of presidential candidates for kyrgyzstans july <num>23</num>  election closed on may <num>18</num>  .
a total of <num>18</num>  individuals submitted documents to stand for office . 
the next day ,  however ,  opposition politician ismail isakov withdrew from the race in support of united opposition candidate and social democrat leader almazbek atambayev . 
the opposition is calling on another opposition politician ,  temir sariyev ,  to do the same . 
five candidates submitted their documents to the central election committee on the final day . 
one had to be forced out of the building . 
according to kyrgyz media reports ,  choro sarypbekov submitted his soviet passport to committee employees and announced his intent to cleanse the country of filth on behalf of the great commander mikhail frunze . 
when the revolution soldier began behaving inappropriately ,  central election committee employees called the police ,  who took sarypbekov to the local police office . 
the candidates must now pass a state exam to prove their knowledge of the kyrgyz language . 
head of election technology at the central election committee amankul moldaliyev said the candidates will take the exam on different days from may <num>21</num>  to june <num>6</num>  .

<num>7</num>  members of hizb ut-tahrir convicted in tajikistan
tajikistan - seven members of the hizb ut-tahrir party in tajikistan were convicted and sentenced to various punishments in a verdict handed down may <num>14</num>  by the court in khujand in the sogdi region . 
the courts presiding judge ,  iso tavakkalov ,  said all of the accused were found guilty of organising a criminal group ,  igniting national ,  racial ,  inter-ethnic or religious enmity and calling for the violent overthrow of the constitutional order of tajikistan . 
all of the accused are citizens of tajikistan and residents of the northern region . 
their sentences ranged between three and ten years imprisonment in a maximum security prison . 
last september ,  sogdi region law enforcement detained an active member of the group . 
a search of his home uncovered literature in the basement calling for the violent overthrow of the countrys constitutional order . 
during the investigation that followed ,  the other members of the group were arrested . 
the judge emphasised that ,  according to the accused ,  they fell into the organisations net as a result of the deception of those who recruited them . 
practically all of them expressed their consent to the sentence . 
hizb ut-tahrir has been active in tajikistan since the end of <num>1998</num>  .
the party has been banned in the republic since <num>2000</num>  .
though it has not been found to be involved in international terrorism ,  one of its main goals is the reconstitution of the islamic khalifat on the territory of muslim countries . 
for that reason ,  the rise in the number of its followers caused concern among national governments that have recently taken increasingly harsh measures against the movement .

kyrgyzstan - may <num>17</num> -<num>20</num>  saw the first rainbow kyrgyzstan art festival against homophobia and transgender phobia . 
it was organised by the labrys association ,  which protects the rights of sexual minorities ,  and received financial support from the dutch ngo hivos and the sos federation of sexual minorities . 
labrys head anna kirey said the festival included round table discussions with the participation of medical practitioners ,  human rights activists and experts on sexual orientation and gender identity . 
the festival also included poetry evenings ,  film screenings ,  a photography exhibition on the problems faced by sexual minorities in cis countries and a musical entitled the gay puppy . 
the main event of the festival ,  however ,  was the showing of a sociological photo comic book on transgender self-expression ,  the road to yourself ,  kirey said . 
the events were held under the umbrella of the defence of human rights . 
for us ,  it was important to remind festival visitors and participants that we all have the same human rights regardless of our social position or sexual orientation ,  kirey emphasised . 
the festival also presented a report by human rights watch on the situation of lesbians ,  bisexual women and transgender men in kyrgyzstan . 
labris concluded that sexual minorities are the population group most discriminated against in kyrgyzstan . 
labrys is one of two organisations in the country that defends the rights of sexual minorities . 
the other is the social fund oasis ,  founded by kyrgyzstans aids alliance and the countrys substance abuse centre . 
various estimates suggest there are between <num>18,000</num>  and <num>35,000</num>  men living in kyrgyzstan who belong to the sexual minority . 
according to oasis ,  about <num>5,000</num>  homosexuals and about <num>20</num>  gay and <num>15</num>  lesbian couples live in bishkek and its suburbs alone . 
according to the international gay and lesbian human rights commission ,  seven people from kyrgyzstan received asylum in the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  on the grounds of sexual persecution . 
human rights activists claim police are particularly aggressive towards individuals belonging to the sexual minority . 
regardless of the fact that in kyrgyzstan criminal prosecution of same-sex relations ceased in <num>1998</num>  , persecution of them continues in the form of police raids on gays and lesbians . 
in one well known incident ,  members of the police force placed an advert in local papers to extort money from those who responded and took in us$5 , 000
human rights activists also claim that police have been involved in instances of violent beatings and abuse of sexual minorities .

an afghan official said <num>34</num>  militants and <num>22</num>  arabs and pakistanis ,  identified by personal documents found on their bodies ,  were killed in the attack . 
among the dead were six who detonated suicide vests during the battle . 
dozens of militants tried to repel the pre-dawn attack on the heavily fortified positions ,  some using high ground to fire on nato forces ,  which led to them calling in air strikes . 
weapons caches containing rocket-propelled grenade launchers ,  ak-47 assault rifles ,  suicide vests and other armaments were also confiscated ,  according to the military . 
in a separate incident ,  arsonists burned down a boys school overnight in daman district in neighbouring kandahar province . 
another boys' school in kandahar city was hit by a rocket the same night ,  but only a wall was damaged ,  said najibullah ahmadi ,  the provincial education director . 
many of the harshest taliban attacks have been on girls' schools ,  seen by extremists as antithetical to their brand of islam ,  but boys' schools have not been immune . 
uzbekistans legal profession in peril
the number of lawyers at judicial proceedings in uzbekistan may diminish sharply . 
tashkent - the recertification of lawyers ,  set to conclude on july <num>1</num>  , is continuing in uzbekistan . 
the government asserts recertification is being conducted to raise the qualifications of the nation's lawyers . 
they and human rights activists ,  however ,  contend that the action is aimed at eliminating the institution of independent law practitioners in the republic . 
two prominent attorneys ,  ruhiddin komilov and rustam tuliaganov ,  who have defended human rights activists ,  journalists ,  and individuals accused of islamic extremism have already lost their licences . 
human rights activist yelena urlayeva believes the authorities are using recertification as a weapon against lawyers defending parties accused of political crimes . 
according to surat ikramov ,  the head of an action group of uzbekistan independent human rights activists ,  almost <num>600</num>  lawyers have not passed the recertification . 
he noted that the probability that all of them defended only opponents of official tashkent is fairly slim . 
ikramov does not rule out the possibility that lawyers regarded as undesirable by the government for whatever reason will have their licences revoked as well . 
he estimates that there are almost <num>4,000</num>  lawyers in the country today and <num>2,000</num>  of them may not be recertified .

ruslan chagayev has shown once again that he cant vie for the championship title for health reasons . 
universum ,  the promotion company behind the uzbek boxer ,  has produced medical documents showing that chagayev does not actually have hepatitis ,  but only antibodies to the virus . 
im healthy ,  and doctors said i am not infectious ,  chagayev claimed . 
representatives of the uzbek boxer say the finnish boxing federation did not in fact cancel the match ,  but instead only requested that valuyev be given a hepatitis shot within <num>24</num>  hours of the end of the face-off ;  but valuyev refused that proposal . 
we cannot understand this ,  said an official statement on universum box-promotions website . 
the german boxing federation  ( bdb )  ,  the wba ,  and the doctor representing the austrian boxing federation have all classified him as safe . 
valuyevs people are trying to dodge ruslan chagaev by hook or by crook . 
we will examine this situation very closely and take any steps necessary .  " 
kyrgyzstan concerned by afghanistan and pakistan situation
islamic movement of uzbekistan  ( imu )  field commander takhir yuldashev . 
on june <num>1</num>  , kyrgyz president kurmanbek bakiyev held a working meeting to discuss the global situation with particular focus on pakistan and afghanistan ,  which have significant influence on the security of central asia and kyrgyzstan . 
recent terrorist attacks in the uzbek city of khanabad made it obvious that the threat is very real and closer than ever . 
an afghan border officer who wished to remain anonymous affirmed that in late april about <num>40</num>  militants entered tajikistan from the afghan province of badakhshan hoping to reach the so-called triangle ,  the batken region of kyrgyzstan where the borders of tajikistan ,  kyrgyzstan ,  and uzbekistan meet . 
few people in afghanistan doubt that the islamic movement of uzbekistan fighters had a role in the recent incident in khanabad ,  said a deutsche welle report on the may <num>25</num> -<num>26</num>  clashes and terrorist attacks there .

the company had annual sales of us$96 , 000 but after paying profit ,  property and other taxes ,  its net profit was just <num>6,700</num>  $  .
to compensate ,  the government has granted profit and property tax exemptions for small businesses in an effort to strengthen commerce . 
it also increased lending to the sector ,  which under the anti-crisis programme has received <num>307.9</num>  $  million so far this year ,  up <num>65</num>  percent from last year . 
the government is optimistic ,  however ,  that the measures taken this year will provide jobs for at least <num>400,000</num>  returning migrant workers .

leadership circles in kazakhstan and uzbekistan responded favourably to barack obamas june <num>4</num>  speech in cairo during which the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president called for a new beginning between the <abbr>u.</abbr> 
a statement released by zhakhon ,  the news agency operated by uzbekistans foreign affairs ministry said ,  most importantly ,  obamas speech confirmed his administrations emphasis on a realistic and pragmatic approach to international affairs . 
it was a call to cut the vicious circle of mutual distrust and confrontation with the muslim world ,  with an appeal to fight against negative stereotyping of islam from any and all quarters ,  and to usher in a new era of relations between the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and the muslim world . 
his speech expressed a desire to find new avenues for cooperation between the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and muslims everywhere in search of peace ,  justice and progress . 
pundits cited the pragmatism of the obama administrations approach to democracy building . 
essentially ,  one commentator noted ,  the administration has made it clear that it believes that imposing its own values on countries with completely different histories and cultures is counterproductive . 
the most important thing is to practice what you preach ,  and continue to defend democracy ,  rule of law ,  freedom of speech and religion ,  and other universally acknowledged human values . 
kazakhstan president nazarbayev said he believed obamas speech reflected a desire for reconciliation and mutual understanding with the muslim world . 
 " i am heartened by the constructive approach of the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president ,  and i can pledge that kazakhstan is ready to answer in kind to strengthen political ,  economic and cultural cooperation with the united states "  ,  kazakh president nazarbayev said . 
in his speech ,  obama made it clear that he understands the difference between these styles of leadership ,  and it is with profound optimism that i accept his call to work together .  " 
more than half of kazakhstan's diverse population ,  and a significant portion of uzbekistan's ,  are followers of the hanafi madhhab ,  one of four schools of law in sunni islam . 
both countries are members of the organisation of the islamic conference  ( oic )  .

tashkent - the warming rate in uzbekistan is twice as high as the world average ,  and the number of days with temperatures above <num>40</num>  c has grown by a third in the past <num>10</num>  years . 
with its temperate climate ,  tashkent could soon be in the subtropical zone ,  according to the second national report on uzbekistan presented at a meeting of members of the un framework convention on climate change in bonn ,  germany . 
because evaporation of water from the fields is increasing as the temperature rises ,  the amusarya river basin wheat harvest is predicted to decline <num>14</num>  percent by <num>2050</num>  , and the melon harvest by <num>12</num>  percent . 
the national strategy to adapt to climate change will involve changes in the crop structure . 
the irrigated land sown to cotton ,  currently <num>40</num>  percent of the total ,  will decline to <num>30</num>  percent over the next two years ,  while irrigated land sown to rice will grow <num>23</num>  percent ,  to vegetables <num>40</num>  percent and to melons <num>42</num>  percent . 
experts from uzbekistans social and economic research centre believe the implementation of those changes will ensure food security for the country .

while the target gdp growth for the next fiscal year was fixed at <num>3.3</num>  percent in the budget ,  prominent businessmen requested more financial support to meet that objective ,  arguing industry was being taxed more than relieved . 
the budget allocates us$7 . 97 billion for public sector development ;  <num>4.23</num>  $  billion for defence ,  <num>390</num>  $  million for education ,  <num>80.24</num>  $  million for health and <num>617.28</num>  $  million for relief and rehabilitation projects . 
khar stated that the target for tax revenue collection has been raised <num>15.7</num>  percent to <num>17</num>  $  billion ,  and the rest of the expenditure will be met through foreign loans and grants . 
millions more are expected through the friends of pakistan consortium . 
later ,  advisor to the prime minister on finance shaukat tarin said the burden of subsidies has been removed from the budget . 
he also signalled the country may go to the imf once again ,  this time for <num>4</num>  $  billion . 
he ventured that there are clear indications that the national economy is building up ,  and explained that to bring the budget deficit down to <num>1.5</num>  $  billion the government cut expenditures and removed unnecessary products from its estimate for imports . 
former chairman of pakistan readymade garment manufacturers and exporters association ejaz khoker said that it is not clear how the government was going to revive the industrial sector ,  particularly textiles ,  which account for <num>67</num>  percent of the countrys total export earnings . 
president of the karachi chamber of commerce and industry anjum nisar expressed deep concern about the budgets revenue targets ,  characterising them as difficult to achieve ,  especially considering the current security situation in the country . 
northern tajikistan considers suicide problem
socio-economic problems and domestic violence are among reasons people take their own lives . 
 ( photo by reuters / vasily fedosenko ) 
experts note that socio-economic problems and domestic violence are among the main factors involved when people take their own lives . 
suicide expert davron muhamadiev notes that tajikistan has no single system for counting and registering suicides . 
a count is kept by the interior ministry authorities ,  the public prosecutors office ,  forensic science authorities and medical institutions . 
the problem is that each institution has its own methods of counting that are not conducive to consolidation ,  which may increase the probability of double-counting and distortion of the actual figures ,  he noted . 
according to muhamadiev ,  an analysis of mass media for <num>2006</num> -<num>08</num>  indicates that reports on suicides in sughd province were regularly published while there was virtually no information on suicides in media of other regions of the country . 
observers ,  however ,  virtually never encounter information on suicides in dushanbe media ,  its suburbs or elsewhere in the country ,  muhamadiev emphasised . 
in his opinion ,  this tendency is owing to the fact that the government is not inclined to publicise suicide data . 
authorities and law enforcement agencies in sughd province ,  however ,  are more open to revealing the extent of the problem and discussing it openly . 
in <num>2007</num>  the problem of suicide in sughd province caught the attention of president emomali rahmon . 
at a meeting with representatives of law enforcement agencies in khujand ,  he demanded they increase efforts to eradicate the phenomenon . 
this stimulated changes in the system of counting ,  registering ,  and reporting incidents of suicide in the province ,  which have not been adopted elsewhere in the country . 
developing ways to reduce the number of suicides in the country ,  however ,  has not yet been seriously addressed .

kazakhstan - the shymkent employment and social programmes department has begun providing a free new service for disabled people called social taxis . 
disabled people will be able to travel with their caregivers . 
if a passenger does not have a caregiver ,  it will be the drivers job to offer them assistance . 
drivers of the taxis were selected not only on the basis of their professional taxi-driving skills ,  but also their politeness ,  courtesy ,  tactfulness and physical strength . 
our passengers find it difficult to get around on their own ,  said erbol amanjolov ,  a social taxi driver . 
shymkent is the fifth city in kazakhstan to get a locally funded free transport service for the disabled . 
the ministry of labour and social welfare plans to roll out the experiment nationwide and believes that the importance of the social taxi service cannot be overestimated ,  as it offers the disabled an easier way to lead more active lifestyles .

the equipment includes portable devices ,  endoscopes ,  binoculars ,  x-ray equipment and video cameras to identify forged documents and prevent contraband at the fotekhabad and patar border posts on the tajik-uzbek border . 
the eu initiated its programme to help manage borders in central asia in <num>2004</num>  .
it is conducted under the un development programme through grants provided to border forces ,  the customs service and other tajik law enforcement agencies . 
more generally ,  the eu will also help improve institutional reforms in border management ,  build staff potential in central asian countries and finance the modernisation of infrastructure along the key trade routes in the region under the programme .

kazakh courts introduce video surveillance
video recording of court trials will reduce corruption ,  make trials more transparent and increase public confidence in the judicial system . 
 ( photo by yoshikazu tsuno / afp / getty images ) 
astana - a project to introduce video recording in court trials was presented june <num>24</num>  in kazakhstans supreme court . 
the project is being conducted with support from usaid . 
video and audio equipment was installed in <num>27</num>  courtrooms in astana ,  almaty and akmola regions . 
so far this year ,  <num>116</num>  of <num>190</num>  trials have been recorded on video . 
court secretaries were trained to use the video systems . 
the video system includes four cameras and six microphones . 
more than <num>70</num>  percent of the kazakh citizens surveyed said they trust courts that have video recording more than other courts ,  and <num>80</num>  percent support the use of video cameras in all of the countrys courtrooms . 
the number of appeals dropped by nearly two-thirds in one almaty district court since video was introduced . 
experts said the video recordings will reduce corruption ,  make trials more transparent and will increase public confidence in the judicial system . 
six more courts will install video systems by the end of the year . 
the video cameras will eventually be installed in all of kazakhstans courtrooms . 
despite the undeniable advantages of the new system ,  the courts that have already installed it say the process of servicing the system and storing the recordings has not been fully worked out yet . 
judges said new administrative regulations are required for that purpose . 
<num>10,000</num>  tajik migrants jobless in russia
tajikistan - on june <num>29</num>  , moscows cherkizovsky market ,  one of russias largest ,  was closed . 
he said the market was closed because it failed to clear up a large number of violations during the one-month deadline it had been given to do so . 
moscow authorities wanted to close cherkizovsky back in <num>2007</num>  , egamzod said . 
there have been numerous fires and clashes among criminals there in recent years . 
then the closure date was put off until last january . 
the property is now slated to be the site of a shopping centre and athletic centre with a park in <num>2011</num>  .
he noted ,  however ,  that it is impossible to put a precise figure on these groups since many tajik migrants are not registered . 
the permanent closure of the market will make it very difficult for tajiks who worked there to find employment ,  which will cause serious problems for the large families they support . 
the tajik authorities should think about a way to return those who have lost their jobs back to tajikistan ,  egamzod said . 
these days ,  when everyone is short of cash ,  the only place where tajik migrants could count on at least a miserly wage was the cherkizovsky market . 
migrant labourers make up nearly a third of the electorate ,  and if certain politicians and parties can bring them over to their side ,  it will be much harder for the government to make the elections go according to plan ,  samiev said . 
pakistan upping border force along helmand stretch
islamabad - pakistans army has deployed more troops to a stretch of the afghan border to stop taliban militants fleeing a major <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  / afghan offensive in the helmand province . 
residents have expressed concern that the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  troop buildup in southern afghanistan could push the militants across the poorly guarded and mountainous border into pakistan . 
weve mustered more troops from the other areas of the border to deploy opposite the helmand region ,  maj gen athar abbas told the associated press july <num>3</num>  .
we expected that the effect of this operation would be more pressure on the border . 
we are redeploying from where there is less pressure on the border . 
abbas declined to provide information on how many troops were being sent to bolster those already along that stretch of the border ,  or exactly how much of the move was coordinated with the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> 
he added ,   " it started months ago . 
 [ the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ]  indicated that troops would come to helmand and the eastern part of afghanistan . 
the possibility of insurgents wanting to cross our border was visualised ,  and we have addressed it by beefing up the border posts .  " 
pakistan shares a <num>2,600</num>  kilometre border with afghanistan . 
the section opposite helmand is around <num>260</num>  kilometres long and lies in baluchistan province where <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  officials believe the afghan taliban's top leadership is hiding out . 
last year ,  nato and pakistani forces cooperated in a series of complementary operations on the border between afghanistan's kunar province and the bajur region in pakistan . 
abbas said pakistan has <num>1,100</num>  posts along the whole border ,  with some <num>60,000</num>  military and paramilitary troops deployed there . 
wto uneasy about customs union proposal
secretary locke believes that the idea of kazakhstan ,  belarus and russia joining the wto as a single customs union could stall their accession indefinitely . 
 ( photo by alex wong / getty images ) 
a proposal by three former soviet republics ,  kazakhstan ,  belarus and russia ,  to join the world trade organisation  ( wto )  as a single customs union has not been well received by member states of the body . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  secretary of commerce gary locke said on july <num>8</num>  that the proposal tabled in june by russian prime minister vladimir putin is unworkable . 
he added that most wto member states viewed the three-cornered proposal as unprecedented and felt that it would cause many complications and stall the process of those countries entering the organisation indefinitely . 
after kazakhstans president nursultan nazarbayev announced on june <num>12</num>  that he had broken off his countrys independent negotiations with the wto ,  belarus and russia followed suit . 
the members of the tripartite customs union are currently engaged in talks in astana in an attempt to coordinate their positions . 
they plan to arrive at a joint decision on the matter by the end of july . 
some observers in kazakhstan believe that the decision to seek wto membership jointly with russia and belarus was made by the kazakh government due to the fact that kazakhstans economy is ill-prepared for accession to the body . 
the three countries have engaged in accession negotiations independently for more than <num>15</num>  years . 
russian sources claim russia is closest to gaining membership with kazakhstan and belarus lagging further behind . 
the eurasian economic community ,  formed among former soviet republics ,  decided to create a customs union in august <num>2006</num>  that will be implemented next year . 
by then ,  the member states will have harmonised their customs duties and open their borders to other member states .

islamabad - fresh from his productive meeting with prime minister manmohan singh on the margins of the 15t non-aligned movement  ( nam )  summit at the egyptian seaside resort of sharm el-sheikh ,  pakistan premier yousuf raza gilani praised his indian counterpart for his political sagacity and statesmanship . 
whatever  [ dr singh ]  said on the floor of the house is the stand we took  [ in the meeting ]  and i think this will really help the two countries ,  he said at a july <num>18</num>  press conference . 
we discussed in detail the composite dialogue and ,  in principle ,  we agreed that … dialogue between both the countries is the only way forward . 
we  [ have ]  <num>1.5</num>  billion people  [ in south asia ]  and we cant make them suffer or  [ hold them ]  hostage to such issues . 
gilani also dismissed repeated suggestions by pakistani journalists that he had not brought up alleged indian meddling in baluchistan and the tribal areas . 
gilani said the joint statement underlines our concerns over indias interference in baluchistan and other areas of pakistan . 
but asked about singhs response to this ,  gilani said only that they agreed that both countries were victims of terrorism . 
singh had assured him that he was ready to discuss all issues ,  he said . 
describing singh as a statesman ,  gilani said he realises that both countries have problems of poverty ,  illiteracy and hunger ,  which they should focus on eradicating .

he said the ctf ,  covering <num>6.2</num>  million square kilometres of sea and <num>10,500</num>  kilometres of coastline bordering <num>14</num>  nations around the gulf of oman ,  the north arabian sea ,  the gulf of aden ,  the horn of africa and the red sea ,  has immense importance due to the presence of three of the most important maritime choke points in the world :  the straits of hormuz ,  the suez canal and bab ul mandab . 
in addition to other vital trade ,  one third of the worlds oil supply transits through these choke points . 
in accordance with the policy of collaborative maritime security ,  pakistans navy remains committed to play a role to realise the shared goal of regional stability and security ,  zakaullah said after assuming command . 
the participation of the pakistan navy in regional maritime security is in line with the governments decision to fight terrorism in all its manifestations ,  he said . 
the navy is totally committed to play its due role in maintaining stability and a security in the region . 
the same day ,  the headquarters of the united peoples movement filed an appeal in which it claimed that more than <num>60</num>  percent of the voters cast ballots for its candidate ,  almazbek atambayev . 
the opposition also contended that bakiyevs family clan usurped all the highest bodies of the nations state authority and called for protests across the country on july <num>29</num>  .
atambayev stated that neither he nor his supporters recognise president bakiyevs re-election as legitimate and claimed the cec simply stole the peoples' votes .

founded in <num>2002</num>  , mgm is headquartered in khudzhand and describes its mission as defusing conflicts through proactive journalism . 
mgm chairman farrukh akhrorov explained that the above survey sampled the views of <num>3,000</num>  current and recent secondary school students throughout tajikistan . 
similarly ,  around <num>80</num>  percent of the teenage females surveyed ,  almost all from rural areas ,  saw no reason to continue studies after grade school . 
of those planning to go to university ,  only one half of <num>1</num>  percent expect to gain useful knowledge there . 
the remainder described their decision to attend college as a way to postpone army service ,  acquire a degree or be no worse off than classmates . 
around <num>7</num>  percent of tajik teens ,  principally urban residents ,  want to study abroad ,  should the opportunity present itself . 
their motivations include the desire to receive a better education than they can receive in country and learn a useful foreign language . 
 " they believe that the country's education system is corrupt and constantly forces students to pay bribes ,  which muslims regard as a sin ,  "  akhrorov says . 
in addition ,  many of these young people would feel like outsiders in an environment in which social success hinges on clothing and attitudes ,  and would prefer to pursue learning independently or in middle eastern religious centres . 
tashkent investigates attacks on high profile religious leaders
uzbekistan - on july <num>31</num>  , unidentified assailants stabbed tashkents top imam ,  anvar-kori tursunov ,  nine times . 
the religious leader has been hospitalised and is currently in critical but stable condition . 
the attack came in the evening near tursunovs house in the village of angiabad in the tashkent region . 
three men called for the imam to come out onto the street ;  when he emerged from his gated yard ,  the assailants stabbed him nine times . 
his cries drew the attention of neighbours ,  and the attackers fled in a white daewoo matiz . 
the imam conducted services in the kukeldash madrasa ,  one of the largest such religious schools in central asia that survives from the 16t century . 
tursunov ,  also known as anvar-kori ,  a title denoting that he knows the koran by heart ,  also holds the post of expert on the religion committee under the government's cabinet of ministers . 
the attack brought to light a similar incident previously unreported in the country's media . 
on july <num>16</num>  , the <num>37</num> -year-old deputy director of the kukeldash madrasa ,  abror abrorov ,  died after being repeatedly stabbed by attackers . 
he ,  too ,  was ambushed in a similar manner outside his own home . 
the deceased was educated at the most prestigious university in the islamic world ,  al-azhar in egypt . 
an expert in religious matters ,  his counsel was also sought by the country's intelligence agencies . 
investigators are pursuing several possible scenarios based on the religious and social activities of the two victims as the attacks may have been the work of religious extremists . 
human rights advocates have expressed concern that this line of investigation could generate mass arrests ,  since uzbekistan often lumps religious moderates and malcontents in the category of extremist .

world powers tell iran to answer quickly on nuclear talks
frankfurt ,  germany - following their meeting in frankfurt on september <num>2</num>  , the five permanent member states of the un security council  ( the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  russia ,  china ,  france ,  the <abbr>u.k.</abbr>  )  and germany  ( the p5+1 )  sent a fresh warning to iran to quickly agree to talks on the countrys nuclear program or face tougher economic sanctions . 
they issued a statement calling on iran to accept the renewal of negotiations that the international community has been asking for since april ,  before the un general assembly meets on september <num>23</num>  .
if tehran does not agree to talks by then ,  it risks the imposition of another round of economic sanctions ,  that this time will deeply damage the iranian economy . 
the german spokesman for the p5+1 also responded to the statement by irans chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili that the nation has prepared an updated nuclear proposal and is ready to discuss it with international powers . 
german foreign ministry political director volker stanzel ,  acknowledged jalilis comments ,  but noted that the p5+1 have given iran only three weeks to respond officially to their warning . 
some analysts contended that jalilis statement was a classic delay tactic designed to change international public opinion ,  and perhaps persuade russia and china ,  major commercial partners for iran ,  that tehran is being cooperative . 
however ,  others assert jalili was addressing a domestic audience and should be heard in the context of irans bitter internal political struggles . 
his remarks have less to do with addressing international public opinion and more to do with the far right in iran and the people around ahmadinejad ,  said middle east analyst for janes information group alex vatanka . 
 " they want to make sure the nuclear issue does not become a chain around their necks .  "

lahore - pakistan cannot emerge from the multiple crises it faces without a fair wage structure to ensure workers have basic necessities ,  said international labour organisation programme analyst margaret reade rounds during an interview on september <num>4</num>  .
unemployment is increasing and the number of people living below the poverty line has risen to <num>36.5</num>  percent of the population . 
investors are reluctant to establish new industries in the country or expand existing ones due to load shedding and security concerns . 
a set of measures is required that will contribute to reactivating enterprises and providing decent jobs to protect the most vulnerable members of society and set the foundations for a more equitable and prosperous economy . 
pakistans export-dependent economy is being affected due to a fall in consumer demand in  [ the west ]  . 
active engagement of employers and workers is necessary for the success of macro and microeconomic interventions aimed at resolving the crisis ,  she said . 
social justice is necessary ,  not only for workers but for society as well ,  said altaf izzat khan ,  director of the punjab labour department . 
he stressed that bringing pakistans labour laws into conformity with international labour standards ,  and formulating financial and fiscal policies that promote viable work  [ opportunities ]  could go a long way to ensuring industrial peace and stability and achieving social justice for all .

most of rawalpindi had sewers that are just <num>15</num>  cm wide ,  which cannot accommodate the volume now required of them ,  particularly during the summer monsoon season when rainfall can be torrential .

islamabad - pakistans higher education commission  ( hec )  will award <num>1500</num>  scholarships for merit students hoping to pursue a higher education in nursing and midwifery ,  hec chief shehnaz wazir ali said on september <num>7</num>  .
this scholarship programme is part of the governments efforts to revive the nursing sector ,  which is suffering a shortage of qualified nurses due to low enrollment in nursing schools and colleges . 
there is ,  in general ,  a dire shortage of well-trained health care professionals as well . 
unfortunately ,  unemployment is high among physicians ,  largely due to inadequate investment in local health care systems . 
in a related move ,  the defence housing authority  ( islamabad )  has decided to set up a state-of-the-art ,  <num>350</num> -bed teaching hospital along with a medical university and research facilities in collaboration with partners harvard medical international  ( phmi )  ,  a <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  aid group ,  to address the demand for a quality medical institution in the country .

pakistans semi-autonomous northwest tribal belt has become a stronghold for hundreds of taliban ,  al-qaeda and other extremists who fled afghanistan after the nato invasion toppled the taliban regime in late <num>2001</num>  .
last july ,  taliban leader mullah omar mohamed released a taliban code of conduct that expressly forbids the killing of innocent civilians ,  but that provision was obviously ignored in this brutal incident .

islamabad - to minimise petrol consumption ,  solar geysers ,  a local manufacturing company ,  has established the first solar water heater  ( shw )  manufacturing plant in pakistan ,  said solar and alternative energy development board  ( aedb )  director naveed bukhari on september <num>12</num>  .
solar water heating is becoming increasingly popular in developing countries . 
it is estimated that around <num>10</num>  million solar thermal water-heaters have already been installed in the third-world . 
our government will extend all possible support for production of solar water heaters ,  as it will drastically reduce petrol consumption in the country ,  said bukhari . 
the sun can reduce the need for petrol by <num>60</num>  to <num>70</num>  percent . 
to promote swh ,  both the government and the private sector need to play  [ a part ]  . 
the government must subsidise this technology by providing tax exemptions ,  and the industrial sector should adopt this technology ,  bukhari said . 
to help create a market for swh ,  the aedb will implement a public awareness campaign to promote their use in pakistan . 
hot water is not only an essential requirement in domestic housing ,  but in industries such as textiles ,  beverages and food processing ,  among others ,  that use water at temperatures between <num>40</num>  and <num>80</num>  degree celsious  . 
uzbekistan demands analysis of neighbours hydroelectric projects
higher prices for energy resources are driving tajikistan and kyrgyzstan to accelerate the construction of new dams and water reservoirs . 
 ( photo by reuters / ilya naymushin ) 
uzbekistan - uzbekistan is protesting the construction of hydroelectric projects in neighbouring tajikistan and kyrgyzstan . 
a recent accident at the sayano-shushensky hydroelectric power plant in russia provided uzbekistan with a strong argument for their protest ,  the issue of safety . 
on september <num>21</num>  , uzbek ministry of emergency situations chief expert vladimir zufarov claimed that accidents at water reservoirs in kyrgyzstan or tajikistan could result in the flooding of dozens of towns and hundreds of other settlements in uzbekistan . 
their destruction could lead to uncontrolled emptying ,  large-scale flooding and the destruction of underlying water reservoirs and other hydraulic structures ,  he asserted . 
uzbeks also fear that the use of the water from large rivers for the generation of electricity will reduce the amount of available for irrigation . 
hydroelectric power is an important source of energy for kyrgyzstan and tajikistan ,  which do not have significant oil or gas reserves . 
both countries recently had to buy gas and oil and oil at high prices from their neighbours ,  which prompted them to expedite construction of new dams and reservoirs as an alternate source of power .

karachi - the <abbr>u.n.</abbr>  closed its world food programme  ( wfp )  office in islamabad after five people were killed and four others injured by a bomb blast on <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>5</num>  .
the confirmed fatalities are an iraqi information and communication technology officer ,  botan ahmed ali al-hayawi and four pakistanis :  abid rehman ,  a senior finance assistant ;  gulrukh tahir ,  a receptionist ;  farzana barkat ,  an office assistant and mohammed wahab ,  a finance assistant . 
a joint investigation team has been formed to probe the blast and to find out the terrorists behind the gory incident ,  interior minister rehman malik said by telephone from islamabad . 
we felt very sad and gloomy all day when we heard about the attack on the wfp office ,  said saba kamran ,  a teacher at the sheikh zayed international school in islamabad . 
the terrorists want to alienate pakistan from the international donors ,  and sabotage the relief work in swat and malakand . 
if the wfp and other donor agencies suspended relief work in pakistan ,  it would add to the miseries of the millions of deserving citizens and be a setback to the process of economic recovery ,  said economist dr ashfaq khan by telephone from islamabad . 
china ,  tajikistan adopt yuan for bilateral financial transactions
a sculpture at a beijing art show depicts a <num>100</num>  yuan note with a portrait of former communist party leader mao zedong . 
 ( frederic <abbr>j.</abbr> 
following the conclusion of their talks ,  the chairmen agreed to develop a five-year blueprint for the joint financing of various promising investment projects . 
economist karim ismatov believes that china is likely to push the adoption of its own currency in trade with other smaller neighbours as an alternative to the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  dollar . 
 " the yuan is quite capable of taking on that role in eurasia ,  or at the very least in the shanghai cooperation organisation ,  where china has much influence ,  "  the economist notes . 
ismatov points out that it is in china's interest to provide tajikistan credit ,  as the central asian country will consent to pay interest rates higher than the international norm for government loans . 
it is no coincidence that tajikistan accounts for nearly half of all china's investment in central asia . 
 " tajik businessmen and bankers don't really care which convertible currency ,  dollars or yuan ,  they use for international transactions . 
chinese investments and loans ,  which currently provide a financial lifeline to the country ,  are more important to them . 
the switch to the yuan will boost trade and economic cooperation between the two countries and in the next year or two ,  china stands to become tajikistan's main trading partner ,  "  the economist concludes . 
new appointments in kyrgyz government
the opposition believes that the reforms of president bakiev  ( c )  are a predictable attempt to consolidate power . 
<num>26</num>  , president bakiyev announced the first appointments and turn-over of personnel in his plan for reforming the state administration system of kyrgyzstan ,  which calls for a <num>40</num>  percent reduction in government and presidential administration staff . 
government department heads were the first to be axed . 
the entire directorship of the agency for drug control was let go ,  which analysts attribute to its poor performance in the fight against illegal drug trade . 
national security council secretary adakhan madumarov was also fired ,  as his performance was sharply criticised by civil society organisations and parliament . 
new energy minister ilyan davydov . 
 ( akipress agency ) 
the president named his <num>32</num> -year-old son ,  maxim ,  who some think is being groomed to succeed him ,  as head of cadii . 
a key change in the presidential reform programme has been the elevation in status of the foreign minister ,  now designated as government minister of foreign affairs ,  removing that position from direct supervision by the prime minister . 
external political and economic affairs are now the prerogative of the presidential institute rather than the government . 
political analyst marat kazakpaev is also sceptical . 
the bureaucratic lay-offs and reshuffling of personnel do not yet provide evidence of any fundamental reform of the state administration system ,  kazakpaev said . 
the turkmen government sees the avaza tourist resort as a destination for tourists worldwide . 
the project includes a horse race track ,  a golf course ,  a water park ,  an auto race track ,  a boating course on a man-made river ,  a casino complex and parks . 
president berdymukhamedov said at the opening of the hotels that an entire complex of upscale hotels would be built on turkmenistans pristine caspian sea coast in the next two to three years ,  where hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world can vacation in comfort . 
the president did not mention the issue of visa requirements for foreign tourists ,  without which the project is unlikely to be a success . 
turkmenistan has not signed agreements to develop tourism with russia and central asian countries ,  and thus far tourists outside the former soviet union are not rushing to visit the sultry turkmen paradise .

suicide bomber strikes bank in rawalpindi
police at the scene of a suicide bomb blast in rawalpindi ,  in the outskirts of islamabad ,  on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>2</num>  .
rawalpindi ,  pakistan - a suicide bomber killed <num>35</num>  people outside a bank near pakistan's capital on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
<num>2</num>  , as the un said spreading violence had forced it to start pulling out some expatriate staff and suspend long-term development work in areas along the afghan border . 
hours later ,  another suicide bomber struck in the eastern city of lahore ,  exploding a car at a police checkpoint as officers went to search it . 
 " by putting their lives in danger ,  our men have saved the city from enormous sabotage ,  "  lahore police chief pervaiz rathor told reporters at the scene . 
the attack in rawalpindi ,  a garrison city just a few kilometres from islamabad ,  occurred as many people waited outside the national bank on a payday to collect salaries . 
because the bank is close to the army headquarters ,  most of the people waiting in line were from the military ,  said mohammad mushtaq ,  a soldier who was wounded . 
no group has claimed responsibility for the bombing ,  but this is not unusual in attacks that kill many civilians . 
pakistan's president ,  prime minister and other top officials condemned the blast ,  and vowed to continue the offensive in south waziristan ,  where the taliban and al-qaeda are believed to have hide-outs . 
the un decided to suspend long-term development work in pakistan's tribal areas and its north west frontier province ,  after losing <num>11</num>  of its personnel in attacks in pakistan this year ,  including last month's bombing of the world food programme's office in islamabad that killed five people . 
tehrik-e-taliban pakistan leaders flee south waziristan
pakistani soldiers near an important militant base in south waziristan on <abbr>nov.</abbr>  <num>6</num>  .
karachi - most ttp leaders have fled south waziristan to escape the armys operation against them ,  said awami national party  ( anp )  senator haji adeel on nov <num>5</num>  .
we have information that taliban leaders have fled to north waziristan and other areas from where they can slip into the paktika province in afghanistan ,  he said . 
analysts anticipated tough resistance from the taliban during the offensive ,  but the early success of army operations in karama ,  kanigurram and sararogha suggests that the taliban leaders decided to flee rather than fight . 
defeat of the ttp in south waziristan would be a significant blow to the militants and their network in pakistan ,  and would also boost the morale of the military ,  adeel said . 
military operations are the only way to crush terrorism in pakistan and eliminate the taliban network ,  he asserted . 
during the fast-approaching extreme winter weather ,  ttp leaders are expected to move into safe hideouts in waziristan where they can plan their next move ,  adeel said . 
we believe ,  however ,  that the armys operation will be successful and damage the network and training centres of the taliban in south waziristan . 
the military is determined to complete the operation in south waziristan ,  before the start of snow-fall in the area ,  inter-services public relations  ( ispr )  said in a press release . 
the army will soon push towards ladha ,  another militant stronghold ,  and move on to destroy more taliban bases . 
bomb kills <num>24</num>  , wounds more than <num>100</num>  in pakistan
peshawar ,  pakistan - a car bomb exploded outside a crowded market in northwestern pakistan on <abbr>nov.</abbr> 
the blast in charsadda ,  north of peshawar ,  was caused by <num>40</num>  kilogrammes of explosives stuffed into a van ,  said peshawar senior police chief liaqat ali khan . 
authorities were investigating whether the attack ,  which killed at least <num>24</num>  people and wounded <num>102</num>  others ,  was carried out by a suicide bomber ,  he said . 
foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi condemned the attack ,  calling those behind it the enemies of islam . 
the government has pledged to press ahead with the offensive despite the assaults . 
the west supports the south waziristan operation ,  given that pakistan's tribal belt is home to many militants involved in attacks on nato troops across the border in afghanistan . 
nwfp information minister mian iftikhar hussain said the latest bombing was evidence that the government crackdown was putting pressure on the militants . 
 " they are not able to target the army freely ,  which is why they are targeting innocent people ,  "  said hussain . 
 " but we and the people of pakistan are determined to continue this  [ battle ]  against the terrorists undeterred .  "

kazakh president fields questions from tv viewers
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev . 
 ( photo by stanislav filippov / afp / getty images ) 
nazarbayev expressed his belief that ,  thanks to a prudent government response ,  kazakhstan avoided the worst consequences of the global financial meltdown . 
he acknowledged ,  however ,  that the country did not emerge unscathed from the crisis ,  and noted that the export volume of the countrys major manufacturers had been cut in half . 
he added ,  however ,  that ,  we have seen no erosion in the social welfare of our citizens . 
the president expressed confidence that the country's economy was on the mend ,  saying that  " at present ,  the financial system has been stabilised… and money has returned to the credit markets .  " 
nazarbayev went on to say that he has no plans to dismiss his cabinet ,  which he feels is adequately managing its duties ,  although he chastised officials for failing to prevent hikes in the cost of fuel and food products . 
broadcast live over state television ,  radio and the internet ,  the programme lasted for nearly three hours ,  as the president fielded more than fifty questions called in by kazakh citizens . 
he directed government agencies to provide answers to the many other questions asked ,  that he did not have the time to answer . 
monthly incomes in kyrgyzstan are low
these figures showed a year-on-year increase of <num>17</num>  percent ,  higher than the seven percent increase projected at the beginning of <num>2009</num>  by the national bank . 
official statistics show wage increases only for schoolteachers ,  mid-level bureaucrats ,  healthcare workers and labourers in the construction industry . 
to increase the low wages of teachers and doctors ,  parliament member irina karamushkina suggested that parliamentary salaries ,  currently between <num>400</num>  $  and <num>800</num>  $  a month ,  be tied directly to the average wage for these two low-earning professions . 
needless to say ,  no other deputies have yet stepped forward to endorse her proposal . 
a wage of <num>140</num>  $  will cover the cost of two pairs of good shoes ,  four sacks of flour ,  a mobile phone and five pairs of indonesian-made jeans . 
following recent increases in the price of electricity and heating ,  however that amount barely covers the utilities of a one-room apartment . 
all bishkek schools closed on public health grounds
city authorities are concerned at the large number of people who have caught colds ,  respiratory infections and seasonal flu . 
between <num>28</num>  and <num>35</num>  percent of pupils ,  and approximately <num>20</num>  percent of teachers in the city are ill . 
in kazakhstans largest city ,  almaty ,  <num>165</num>  kilometer  from bishkek ,  authorities have asked the public to comply with measures intended to prevent the spread of flu and respiratory infections ,  the incidence of which is higher than usual for this time of year . 
if the border closure is indeed linked to the a / h1n1 virus ,  it is unclear why similar measures have not been taken along the border with kyrgyzstan . 
students can do more against terrorism
lahore - on november <num>27</num>  , under the slogan terror-free pakistan an interior ministry spokesman in islamabad said the government established a country-wide volunteer student task force  ( vstf )  to increase the capacity to help victims of violent extremists . 
membership in the vstf includes a three-day orientation and basic training course that is organized and taught in schools and colleges . 
interested student can register their names at local police stations . 
the training course has been designed by academics ,  and security experts . 
students of schools around the country have expressed interest in becoming involved in this endeavour . 
the course will provide information to students about terrorism and counterterrorism strategies ,  said parvez rathore a senior police officer in lahore . 
it will prepare students to identify potential threats and keep an eye on suspicious behaviour and people . 
it is high time we sit down and reach an understanding of the root causes of violent extremism so that we can work to control and reduce the menace if not eliminate it ,  rathore added . 
we need to inculcate tolerance towards others in all respects ,  raise awareness among youth about violent extremism ,  and motivate them to reject both extremism and religious intolerance . 
every citizen has a role to play in safeguarding the interests of the population and protecting the country . 
students must also fight against the scourge of terrorism with unity and not abandon their studies ,  said khuram ,  a student of government college university in lahore . 
violent extremists want to keep students away from studies so that the country will not progress . 
educated youth must become involved so that they fail to achieve that objective ,  he said . 
the government is playing its role to counter violent extremism ,  and civil society and the educational system should join them . 
kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan successfully resolve hydro energy issues
the agreements signed as a result of the meeting are intended to address the most urgent issues ,  namely the energy shortfall in kyrgyzstan during the winter period and rationing the demand for water from kyrgyzstans toktogul reservoir . 
the kazakh government will give its neighbour approximately us$6 million in humanitarian aid for the purchase of coal and fuel for its power stations . 
in addition ,  kazakhstan is prepared to invest <num>100</num>  $  million in kyrgyzstan . 
in exchange ,  kazakhstan has requested that the kyrgyz government favourably resolve the status of kazakh pensioners on issyk kul lakes shores ,  and also regulate the demand for water from the toktogul reservoir during the winter period . 
excessive use in winter gives rise to the threat of flooding over a large part of kazakhstans southern regions . 
usenov assured the kazakh government that the demand for water would be regulated ,  and praised the kazakh leaderships determination to resolve the regions hydro energy issues . 
kazakhstan passes law on refugees
kazakhstans need to pass a law on refugees arose from its ratification in <num>1998</num>  of the un convention relating to the status of refugees . 
 ( str / afp / getty images ) 
<num>7</num>  , the president of kazakhstan signed a law on refugees and ratified several amendments to related legislation intended to protect refugees and define their basic rights and obligations in kazakhstan . 
the bills were approved by the senate in november . 
the law that passed and amendments to related legislation on refugees were based on the principles underpinning the convention ,  and clearly set out the legal status and obligations of refugees in kazakhstan . 
providing travel documents for refugees and social welfare assistance for child refugees are among the new measures to be implemented . 
amendments will also be made to the code of administrative violations ,  and laws on immigration and state social welfare . 
according to the ministry of labour and social welfare ,  <num>622</num>  refugees were registered in kazakhstan as of <abbr>oct.</abbr>  <num>1</num>  .
most are from afghanistan . 
almost two-thirds are of working age and four percent are children under <num>16</num>  years of age .

demand for saffron bulbs remains strong
the italian provincial reconstruction team  ( prt )  in herat distributed <num>18</num>  tonnes of saffron bulbs to farmers in <num>14</num>  districts of the province . 
saffron also offers a substantial income . 
one hectare of land can produce about <num>12</num>  kilograms . 
each kilogram fetches about <num>1,500</num>  $   [ usd ]  in herats main bazaar ,  according to officials at the department of agriculture ,  irrigation and livestock . 
high quality ,  packaged saffron can bring in many times that sum . 
in november <num>2006</num>  , in order to assist afghan farmers in successfully growing saffron ,  a national saffron co-ordination and support committee  ( nscsc )  was set up by the ministry of agriculture . 
if income from saffron is close to that earned from poppy growth ,  afghanistans farmers could help move the nations economy in a new direction and abandon its role in producing addictive drugs . 
kazakhstan adopts special law on minorities
ethnic uighurs are one of several minority groups living in kazakhstan .

the law will provide the organisation a role in implementing government policy on ethnic minorities with the aim of ensuring interethnic accord and political stability in kazakhstan . 
despite increased government attention to minority issues and attempts to pursue a cohesive policy on minorities ,  kazakhstan has been unable to prevent interethnic clashes . 
kazakhs clashed with uighurs in <num>2006</num>  and chechens in <num>2007</num>  outside almaty . 
while officials claim that those conflicts had no ethnic component ,  many observers in kazakhstan disagree . 
kazkh mp kamal burkhanov recently said there should be no euphoria over kazakhstans achievements in the sphere of interethnic relations ,  noting that there are problems remaining that must be addressed before the government can claim success in resolving them .

the schools will contribute to the effort to provide buildings for the thousands of students who still study outdoors because of a lack of facilities . 
the provincial director of education estimates that <num>185</num>  schools still do not have a building . 
without knowledge and education it is impossible for countries to advance ,  said kunars provincial governor ,  sayid fazlullah wahidi . 
the new schools include a primary school for boys in manogai district and a secondary school for boys and girls in watapoor . 
we have been studying under the blue sky ,  and when it rains we cannot study . 
wahidi thanked donors for their support .

kyrgyz human rights advocates cry foul over sentencing in naukat incident
participants in the widespread civil unrest during the muslim holiday of uraza bayram  ( eid ul-fitr )  have received lengthy jail sentences . 
kyrgyzstan - a complaint issued at the end of december by the human rights council  ( hrc )  of kyrgyzstans ombudsmen stated that council members were stunned at the harsh sentences meted out to participants in the naukat incident ,  and consider it a case of the punishment not fitting the crime . 
human rights advocates were also taken aback by the speedy conclusion of court proceedings . 
the defendants were tried during the last week of november and sentenced behind closed doors . 
among the convicted were two female members of the hizb ut-tahrir party charged with actively participating in the unrest and sentenced to <num>15</num>  years imprisonment . 
the oldest person convicted was <num>57</num>  , the youngest <num>18</num>  .
the complaint alleges that during arrests and questioning police investigators tried to extort money and jewellery from the accused ,  which may have allowed real culprits to bribe their way to freedom . 
according to the hrd ,  the fact that the majority of the accused are poor and uneducated indirectly supports that assumption . 
chief prosecutor for the osh region sulaymanov denied any misconduct in the investigation and stressed that all the accused received due process . 
kyrgyzstans leadership views the naukat incident as a direct challenge by radical religious groups to the countrys secular foundations . 
according to security council secretary adakhan madumarov ,  the naukat incident is evidence that extremist groups are fomenting unrest ,  and that disorder in the countrys south is an attempt by these groups to impose their views on society . 
uzbek youth study martial arts
unemployment is very high ,  especially for young people . 
as a result ,  social problems such as crime ,  drug and alcohol abuse have been rising . 
while sports and social activities have been shown to help with these problems ,  no facilities were available to the public . 
to address these problems ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  agency for international development  ( usaid )  ,  supported an initiative ,  led by beshkuton residents ,  to turn a vacant building into an indoor sports complex and community centre . 
with the help of local authorities ,  the project was completed in just three months . 
then ,  a group of youth leaders launched a campaign to encourage membership and participation . 
their enthusiasm ,  in turn ,  inspired businesses and the local government to sponsor activities and competitions . 
nearby schools ,  which do not have indoor sporting facilities ,  conduct winter physical education classes there . 
youth leaders are participating in decision-making and helping to expand the centres programme offering . 
they are organising clubs to train young people in boxing ,  wrestling ,  karate ,  gymnastics ,  weight lifting ,  chess and table tennis ,  and participants compete in inter-community and regional competitions . 
the initiative and dedication of both the community and their youth show a strong determination to build a positive future for themselves and their neighbours .

new challenges face telecom industry
cell phones in afghanistan
on average ,  each mobile phone user spends <num>12</num>  $  a month . 
the afghan government has issued gsm licenses to four mobile phone operations . 
allowing for open competition has helped drive down prices . 
if you look at the telecom services in afghanistan before the private sector came in ,  there was no service available ,  no employment ,  no revenues for the government ,  says amir zai sangin ,  the minister of communications and information technology . 
today ,  the telecommunication industry in afghanistan employs over <num>60,000</num>  .
roshans initial business plan was for <num>12,000</num>  users ,  they reached that in one month . 
with <num>50</num>  percent of the country being in a coverage area and just <num>14</num>  percent of the population using phones ,  afghanistan remains an untapped market . 
in total ,  the four operators continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollar per year as they expand their networks . 
as the countrys first private sector investment ,  the telecom industry has been a major source of tax revenue . 
in total the sectors annual taxes make up <num>15</num>  percent of the governments non-donor revenues . 
but the government continuing to raise taxes and security threats has become a concern for its operators .

uzbekistan - at the end of february ,  the human rights organisation memorial completed a new list of people detained and convicted on political and religious grounds in uzbekistan between <num>2004</num>  and <num>2008</num>  .
the islamic movement of uzbekistan is a fundamentalist group based in tajikistan and afghanistan and is allied with the taliban . 
its militants tried to enter the uzbek region of the fergana valley via kyrgyzstan in <num>1999</num>  and <num>2000</num>  .
these three groups are accused by the uzbek authorities of plotting terrorist acts including bombings and attacks by suicide bombers . 
director of the central asian programme at memorial vitaly ponomarev ,  however ,  says the majority of those who fell victim to repression had nothing at all to do with terrorism . 
akromiiya is an informal association of religious businessmen based in the uzbek region of the fergana valley . 
in <num>2005</num>  , its members were charged with anti-government activities . 
during the trial that took place in andijan their supporters staged an armed uprising which was crushed by the army . 
ponomarev says that memorials list also includes <num>30</num>  human rights activists ,  <num>14</num>  members of democratic opposition organisations ,  <num>18</num>  journalists and writers and more than <num>20</num>  followers of non-traditional faiths .

later this month the book will be officially presented to the public in moscow .

if they cannot ,  then we will not have cricket in pakistan at all .  " 
international cricket council chief haroon lorgat backed pakistan hosting international matches again ,  but did not specify when that would happen . 
 " i am mindful of the experience they have gone through and it is a difficult time for them "  ,  butt said .

central and east asian countries face security threats
a map of central asia . 
dushanbe - the countries of central and east asia can ensure security and surmount the consequences of the global financial crisis by working together . 
this conclusion was reached by prominent political analysts and diplomats who participated in the international conference security in the middle east during global crisis held at the russian-tajik slavic university in dushanbe on march <num>27</num>  .
for the first time ,  the conference proceedings were broadcast live to students of tajikistans khudzhan ,  kurgantyube and khorog universities who were able to interact with participants . 
abdullo said the countries must coordinate efforts with nato to stabilise the situation in afghanistan and restore its economy . 
the decision by the central asian countries to allow the pentagon to transport non-military cargo to afghanistan through their territories is the right one ,  he said . 
ismoil rakhmatov ,  head of the history department at the russian-tajik slavic university ,  said the central and east asian countries are still in the beginning stages of their national development so it is paramount for them to stick together in the fight against terrorism and extremism . 
iranian ambassador to tajikistan aliasgar sherdust said incidences of terrorism and religious and ethnic extremism have increased in recent years ,  which is affecting the social-political order ,  stability ,  and economic development of countries in the region . 
he cited salafism as an extremist religious ideology that is a dangerous source of opposition . 
the ideology has expanded its zone of influence because of regional uprisings and the political views of some players . 
furthermore ,  manifestations of extremism and terrorism in afghanistan fed by social and political factors are having a noticeable impact on regional security ,  he observed . 
pakistan suicide bomber kills <num>22</num>  outside mosque
islamabad-a suicide bomber struck a shiite muslim mosque outside the pakistani capital <abbr>apr.</abbr> 
<num>5</num>  killing <num>22</num>  people ,  the latest sign of rising sectarian violence and the growing reach of the islamic insurgency . 
the attack took place in the city of chakwal ,  about <num>100</num>  km south of islamabad . 
it came less than <num>24</num>  hours after at least eight paramilitary troops were killed in a bombing in the capital and six days after militants stormed a police academy in the eastern city of lahore . 
violence in pakistan has long since spilled out of the tribal areas along the afghan border where taliban and al-qaeda militants find a haven ,  and into pakistans heartland . 
the bombing was the third major attack in six weeks in punjab ,  the countrys most populous and affluent province . 
district police officer b .  <abbr>a.</abbr> 
nasir said guards intercepted the bomber before he could enter the mosque compound where at least <num>1,000</num>  people were gathered ,  thus preventing even greater carnage . 
<abbr>u.s.</abbr>  president obama has pledged massive new development aid to pakistan ,  and said authorities must take decisive steps to quell the insurgency . 
the militants increasing strength in pakistan has greatly complicated western troops battle with the taliban and allied groups in afghanistan . 
the fedayeen al-islam ,  which is believed to be either allied with pakistan's taliban movement or a front for another taliban-linked group ,  claimed responsibility for the mosque attack in calls to western news agencies . 
the claim could not be immediately substantiated .

tashkent - an international seminar in tashkent on implementing the un convention against corruption by way of national legislation and in practice organised by the central asian un office on drugs and crime and the uzbek procurator-general drew to a close on april <num>1</num>  .
uzbekistan has introduced stiffer penalties for corruption in the past few years and media have reported instances of criminal cases being brought against senior executives . 
uzbek human rights campaigners assert ,  however ,  that corruption is not decreasing and is merely being monitored by the government . 
cases are only brought against such officials when supervisors have someone else lined up to replace them . 
according to figures held by the office of the uzbek procurator-general ,  the number of checks made by regulatory bodies on the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises and farmers has fallen by two-thirds over the past eight years ,  which has significantly reduced the number of opportunities for civil servants to demand bribes .

uranium production through in situ leaching ,  recognised by the iaea as the safest and cleanest method of producing uranium ,  will continue until <num>2053</num>  .

kyrgyzstan - for one day ,  kyrgyzstans southern capital ,  osh ,  became a hotbed of jazz improvisation ,  musical innovation and positive energy . 
on april <num>27</num>  , jazz groups from switzerland ,  tajikistan ,  uzbekistan and turkmenistan performed there as part of the jazz-bishkek-spring annual jazz festival . 
they also performed in karakol as the now four-year-old event took place outside bishkek for the first time .

she also promised that next years performances in osh will be held over several days rather than just one . 
the festival was organised with assistance from the kyrgyz ministry of culture and information ,  the swiss cooperation office ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  german and austrian embassies in bishkek and the goethe institute in kazakhstan .

 ' kazbat '  documentary remembers kazakh soldiers killed in tajik-afghan border clash
in the  [ early ]  years of independence kazakhstani fighters carried out peacekeeping missions in hot spots outside kazakhstan . 
directed by rustam odinaev ,  the film recreates the events of the time based on the recollections of those who participated in the battle . 
its main aim is to educate young people in the spirit of loyalty and love of country in support of the finest traditions of army life and the continuity of generations . 
astana residents ,  war veterans ,  members of the armed forces and representatives of ngos and the media were present at the debut showing of kazbat on may <num>9</num>  , the eve of victory day . 
mudslides have flooded the foundations and cellars of homes ,  leaving them uninhabitable .

three bridges in batken region were destroyed ,  as were many roads connecting mountain villages . 
virtually all the irrigation canals in the region have been filled with silt . 
according to preliminary figures ,  five homes and outlying buildings have been destroyed . 
the isfan-kok-tash road has been completely washed out . 
because of the high price of baked brick ,  many homes in the south of kyrgyzstan are built from clay ,  making them the first to suffer during the disaster . 
 ( photo by alexei osokin ) 
in the district where the natural disaster struck ,  <num>80</num>  rescue workers from the ministry of emergency situations and ecology are now at work . 
according to deputy rashid tagaev ,  the ministry's material-technical base is clearly inadequate for effective rescue work in a country where <num>90</num>  percent of the territory is mountainous and where emergencies of various kinds occur on an almost daily basis . 
according to experts ,  it is likely that kyrgyzstan will be incapable of dealing with the consequences of the disaster on its own and that the government will have to ask for international help . 
the country loses an average of us$3 . 5 million per year because of technological catastrophes and natural disasters . 
kyrgyzstan's chief meteorological department says that thunderstorms will continue with brief interludes until may <num>25</num>  .
the emergency situation ,  therefore ,  is expected to continue for the duration . 
supreme leader urges iranians not to vote for pro-western candidates
tehran-while irans supreme leader urged the public not to vote for pro-western candidates in the june <num>12</num>  presidential election ,  he did not indicate whether he supports hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . 
the critical election pits ahmadinejad against reformist challengers at a time when the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  ,  under the obama administration ,  is pursuing dialogue after years of shunning iran . 
the reformists seek an easing of social and political restrictions at home and better ties with the west . 
they see a strong opportunity to unseat ahmadinejad ,  who has become increasingly unpopular because of irans economic woes . 
 " do not allow those who would throw their hands up and surrender to enemies and defame the iranian nation's prestige to get into office "  ,  khamenei said in a televised speech in bijar ,  in western iran . 
hard-liners have also denounced the reformist government of former president mohammad khatami ,  who served between <num>1997</num>  and <num>2005</num>  , saying he caved in to western pressure over iran's nuclear activity and suspended uranium enrichment . 
they hail ahmadinejad ,  saying he defied the west and resumed uranium enrichment ,  a process that can be used to make fuel both for both nuclear energy and nuclear weapons . 
the other reformist challenger ,  former prime minister mir hossein mousavi ,  bills himself as capable of straddling islamic values and the freedom necessary to liberalise iran's economy and politics .

kazakhstan to sell bta bank stock to russia
the kazakhstan government is holding talks with russia's sberbank about selling it a large block of bta bank stock . 
 ( photo by reuters / shamil zhumatov ) 
astana - on may <num>29</num>  , the chairman of the board of kazakhstan's samruk-kazyna national welfare fund ,  kairat kelimbetov ,  announced the fund is prepared to sell a block of bta bank stock that it owns to russia's sberbank . 
bta ,  kazakhstan's largest bank ,  was nationalised in february and <num>78</num>  percent of its stock was transferred to the control of the samruk-kazyna fund . 
at the time it was nationalised ,  the bank's foreign debt was valued at us$13 billion . 
according to kelimbetov ,  negotiations over the transfer of bta bank's block of stock to russia's sberbank will conclude in august . 
the samruk-kazyna fund is ready to sell its entire block at that time . 
sberbank has shown an interest in buying bta bank since its financial difficulties began . 
the russian bank is fortifying its position in nations that were republics of the former soviet union through purchases of stock of major financial institutions in them . 
the global financial crisis is only facilitating the fulfilment of these plans . 
despite assurances by samruk-kazyna fund representatives ,  observers doubt kazakhstan will be able to fully guarantee bta bank's debt obligations to creditors ,  which made the sale of the bank's stock necessary .

tehran - iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is being mocked for a video clip in which he boasts that leaders watched him for almost half an hour without blinking as he spoke in a halo of light at the un general assembly in september <num>2005</num>  .
the iranian president at that time indulged in a bit of his favourite sport ,  bashing the <abbr>u.s.</abbr> 
his main opponent ,  mir hossain mousavi ,  accused ahmadinejad of being superstitious and brazenly staring at the camera and telling lies to the nation . 
on june <num>6</num>  , for example ,  ahmadinejad said that inflation stood at <num>15</num>  percent ,  but mousavi showed a report released by the central bank of iran indicating it stood at <num>25</num>  percent . 
ahmadinejads halo comments also have become the source of political satire that takes aim at his pious reputation among his supporters .

the ministry of labour released numbers for the first quarter of this year showing that <num>377</num>  people applied for refugee status ,  he said . 
todorovich also pointed out that refugees once arrived only from the northern provinces of afghanistan ,  but now people from all across afghanistan are seeking shelter in tajikistan . 
he sees this phenomenon as a result of the worsening situation on the ground in afghanistan ,  noting that he expects an even larger wave of afghan refugees in <num>2009</num> -<num>2010</num>  .
 " recently we've seen increasing numbers of afghans who were former employees of foreign embassies and international organisations ,  including the un ,  seeking refugee status in tajikistan "  ,  he said .

in response ,  the unknown individual threw a grenade in their direction .

lahore - in his june <num>20</num>  address to a seminar on clean water in lahore ,  federal environment minister hameed ullah jan afridi said that waterborne and sanitation diseases cost the government <num>1.8</num>  percent of gdp ,  or almost us$1 . 48 billion annually . 
according to an asian development bank report ,  the situation is becoming precarious ,  as water availability in pakistan has decreased from <num>5,000</num>  cubic meters a year per person in the <num>1950</num>  second  to <num>1,000</num>  cubic meters in <num>2008</num>  .
the report cites population increase ,  inefficient irrigation ,  and past mismanagement of water resources as the main reasons for the decline . 
state-of-the-art laboratories should be established throughout the country to test water frequently ,  said dr zarfishan tahir ,  associate professor of bacteriology at the university of health science in lahore . 
the government of pakistan is celebrating <num>2009</num>  as the national year of the environment with the aim to develop policies and enhance awareness about water management .

gunmen kill un worker ,  guard in northwest pakistan
peshawar ,  pakistan - gunmen killed a un employee and a guard during a failed kidnap attempt at a refugee camp in northwest pakistan on july <num>16</num>  .
the attack took place at the kacha garhi camp near peshawar . 
local police chief ghayoor afridi said the assailants tried to abduct the un official and opened fire when he resisted . 
islam khan ,  a guard at the kacha garhi camp ,  said four men drove up to usman's office in a blue car . 
as usman emerged from his office ,  the men tried to kidnap him . 
a camp guard opened fire . 
mahmood shah ,  a former security chief for pakistan's northwest tribal regions ,  said thursday's attack sounded like the work of criminals rather than the taliban because the militants had largely been driven from that area . 
the number of kidnappings has soared in pakistan in recent years ,  especially in the northwest . 
while many of the criminal gangs behind them are believed to be in it for their own gain ,  others are suspected of links to the taliban ,  and kidnappings are believed to be an important source of funding for the militants .

duplicitous policy :  what is the solution ? 
written by our readers
lahore - after the mumbai bomb blasts last november ,  indian print and electronic media directly criticised pakistan and tried to create an image of it as a failed state . 
non-journalistic and undiplomatic language was used against pakistan ,  which brought both countries very close to a terrible war . 
timely and truthful analysis and commentary by pakistani media helped in diffusing the tense situation . 
this situation begs the question :  how much real truth is in the propaganda spread by the indian government and media against pakistan ? 
as far as the question of ajmal kassabs citizenship is concerned ,  there is no denying that he is a pakistani and belongs to pakistani punjab . 
it is also a fact that jamat dawa is headed by the same people from lashkar-e-taiba who were involved in kashmir jihad and attacks on the indian parliament . 
there is also no denying the involvement of hafiz mohammad saeed and maulana masood azhar in the jihadi activities . 
let us discuss the relationship between india and pakistan ,  which ,  due to the sincere efforts of the last government ,  had become very cordial . 
after the mumbai bomb attacks ,  despite the assurances of full cooperation from the government of pakistan ,  india has not shown the level of trust towards pakistan that everyone was hoping for . 
in fact ,  america ,  nato and india realised the duplicitous policy of the pakistani government regarding the mujahedeen  ( kashmiri and afghani )  . 
the governments refusal to take any action against maulana masood azhar ,  hafiz mohammad saeed and  ( id like to make additions to this list on my own )  sayed salah-ud-din  ( supreme commander )  is a clear example of this policy . 
all of the above mentioned people have been directly or indirectly involved in jihadi activities on issues relating to kashmir and afghanistan . 
these activities have not only endangered the peace in the region and the world ,  but have also tarnished the beautiful image of islam ,  as a result of which muslims around the world are looked down upon . 
i would like readers to be unbiased and answer my one question :  is it true that muslims of the world are disgraced due to the idiotic strategies of al-qaeda and taliban ? 
the relationship between india and pakistan cannot become normal until the government of pakistan takes firm and decisive action against aforementioned people . 
to create trust between the two countries it is necessary to file cases in pakistani courts against lashkar-e-taiba ,  joint jihad council and the so-called jihadi hazrat maulana masood azhar because we cannot satisfy the world and india just by putting restrictions on these elements .

the country's largest independent election-monitoring organisation ,  the free and fair election foundation of afghanistan ,  which deployed some <num>7,500</num>  observers around the country ,  said it would withhold judgment while it assessed reports of irregularities ,  violence and low turnout .

kyrgyz police force to reform with osce support
a public agency will be set up to monitor police actions as part of reforms in law enforcement in kyrgyzstan . 
 ( photo :  maxim marmur / afp / getty images ) 
according to lilian darii ,  deputy head of the osce centre in bishkek ,  the maintenance of public order is a sensitive issue in any country . 
therefore it is extremely important that members of law-enforcement agencies show restraint during peaceful demonstrations and marches ,  and strictly observe international standards of human rights ,  she emphasised . 
rinat maksutov ,  a police academy expert in conflict resolution ,  added that ,  to overcome the social tensions arising from clashes between demonstrators and police during protest actions ,  the training courses aim to establish partnerships between the police and civil society ,  through which mutual accusations and recriminations can be avoided . 
one way to achieve this will be to set up a special agency to monitor police force actions . 
the scope of local police services has also improved ,  thanks to the creation of neighbourhood inspectors dedicated to establishing trust between law-enforcement agencies and the public . 
overall ,  kongantiev said ,  the osce has greatly assisted in developing a strategic plan for the reform of interior ministry agencies ,  to be implemented through <num>2012</num>  .

iaea team back from iran inspection
vienna ,  austria - a team of un nuclear inspectors returned on <abbr>oct.</abbr> 
<num>29</num>  from a visit to a previously secret uranium enrichment site in iran ,  and their leader expressed satisfaction with the mission . 
what the inspectors saw ,  and how freely they were allowed to work ,  will be critical in deciding whether the p5+1  ( six world powers seeking to allay fears that iran intends to make nuclear weapons )  will request a new round of talks with tehran . 
the west believes iran revealed the sites existence only because it had learned that the western allies were about to make it public ,  a charge iran denies . 
tehran says it wants to enrich uranium only to make nuclear fuel ,  but the west worries that iran wants to create fissile warhead material . 
beyond that ,  elbaradei is expected to brief russia ,  china ,  britain ,  france ,  the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  and germany ,  known as the p5+1 ,  in an attempt to persuade iran to freeze enrichment . 
irans other enrichment plant ,  a sprawling underground facility at natanz ,  is already under iaea monitoring . 
but irans general refusal to heed un security council demands and freeze enrichment has resulted in three sets of sanctions being imposed on the country by the council .

tajik ,  afghan police fight human trafficking
according to trafficking analysts ,  women are lured abroad mainly because of poverty and gender inequality at home ,  factors that hinder their access to education and entry into the workforce . 
the courses ,  conducted by law school instructors from tajikistan's national university ,  police specialists and representatives from international and local organisations ,  were hosted at dushanbe's centre for educational initiatives to combat human trafficking in the tajik national university school of law . 
founded last year ,  the centre focuses on preparing high-calibre analysts to join the fight against human trafficking . 
since its inception ,  the centre has provided specialised education to more than a hundred students ,  and this year opened its doors to foreign trainees as well . 
 " human trafficking of women and children is an organised international criminal racket that ranks third in profitability after the weapons and narcotics trade ,  "  said aktham abdullayev ,  the executive secretary of tajikistan's joint committee on human trafficking . 
russia urges iran to accept iaea deal
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad  ( l )  shakes hands with russian ambassador alexander sadovnikov in tehran .

this is not to trick iran to take its low-enriched uranium out of its hands ,  alexander sadovnikov ,  moscows ambassador to tehran ,  said in an interview with the official irna news agency . 
we believe that reaching this agreement and signing the technical contract to produce fuel for the tehran reactor is beneficial to iran and will help resolve the nuclear issue ,  he said . 
the deal ,  if approved ,  will mean that irans low-enriched uranium  ( leu )  will be sent to moscow for further enrichment and conversion into nuclear fuel ,  after which it will be returned for use in the tehran reactor ,  which is continuously monitored by the international atomic energy agency  ( iaea )  . 
this proposal has faced stiff opposition from top iranian officials ,  who say it is a western sleight of hand aimed at getting the islamic republic to suspend its uranium enrichment work . 
western powers ,  on the other hand ,  suspect irans uranium enrichment drive is aimed at making weapons ,  a charge strongly denied by tehran . 
moscow recently said ,  however ,  that sometimes sanctions are  " inevitable .  "

the president also underlined that as head of state ,  he has a vested interest in ensuring that the elections are transparent and that the best mps are chosen . 
in rahmons view ,  parties need to work with voters if they are to win seats . 
political parties ought to reach out to people and act in the interests of the state and the nation . 
people can assess the organisational abilities ,  degree of patriotism and human resource potential of each party ,  and can judge whether their candidates are capable of making a real contribution to the development of society and protecting the nations interests ,  rahmon said . 
tajik political analysts say that the preparations for the previous elections were more active than those being made for the upcoming polls . 
this is because the required electoral deposit has been increased to nearly us$1 , 600
most political parties have already expressed dissatisfaction with the fee . 
considering the financial crisis ,  this amount will be too much for many candidates ,  says rustam samiyev . 
china's ministry of foreign affairs discusses hu jintao's upcoming visit to tajikistan and turkmenistan
hu jintao will make his first official trip to tajikistan and his second trip in thirteen years to turkmenistan . 
these visits are of the utmost significance for deepening and strengthening sino-tajik and sino-turkmen relations ,  according to the august <num>21</num>  issue of the chinese newspaper the peoples daily . 
the planned talks are crucial for ensuring central asias security and stability ,  as well as for promoting joint development and harmonious coexistence throughout the region . 
additionally ,  the chinese newspaper reports ,  both sides have developed an effective partnership in combating the east turkestan movement and battling the three forces of evil  ( extremism ,  separatism and terrorism )  . 
east turkestan is another name for the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of the peoples republic of china . 
the uyghurs national liberation movements have been subjected to severe harassment from the chinese authorities ,  who have used equal zeal to squelch all nationalist movements ,  even the peaceful ,  pro-democracy and western-leaning eastern turkestan national congress  ( etnc )  . 
the official noted that the dushanbe summit is the latest in a string of high-profile events aimed at increasing the organisations standing in the world and deepening economic partnerships ,  and will go far toward promoting peace and stability in the region .

kyrgyzstan - amendments to the law on the donation of blood and its components have stripped approximately <num>27,000</num>  blood donors in kyrgyzstan of their annual compensation of us$25 . 
public health minister mara mambetov said the finance ministry insisted on the reduction . 
abazbekov said an analysis of the donated blood revealed several shocking facts . 
more than <num>17</num>  percent of the blood was infected with hepatitis ,  hiv or cyprus fever . 
the contaminated blood was destroyed and the infected donors were included in a database to bar them from ever again donating blood in any transfusion centre ,  abazbekov said . 
the public health ministry said kyrgyzstan is buying artificial blood from russia because of a shortage of donated blood in kyrgyzstan . 
the artificial blood can be thawed as many as five times ,  which is important for kyrgyzstan due to frequent interruption in power supply . 
one vial of artificial blood ,  however ,  costs us$10 , 000 while the average salary in kyrgyzstan is between us$30 and <num>40</num>  $  a month . 
the government of kyrgyzstan has developed a plan to combat extremism
in the opinion of security officials ,  more vigorous activity was displayed by the party of the religious sect hizb ut-tahrir ,  which was prohibited in the country in <num>2004</num>  by a supreme court decision . 
according to the deputy chief of the 9th main administration of the kyrgyzstan mvd ,  taalay kadyrkulov ,  in the past year <num>1,833</num>  active members of hizb ut-tahrir were discovered during special raids and <num>29</num>  firearms ,  <num>736</num>  pieces of ammunition and <num>1.1</num>  kilograms of explosives were seized from members of the party . 
the growth in the influence of the organisation is noted in the south of the country ,  particularly oshskaya and zhalal-abatskaya ,  in which ,  according to official estimates ,  <num>2,500</num>  and <num>5,000</num>  members of the organisation ,  respectively ,  are located . 
at the beginning of <num>2009</num>  , kyrgyzstans prime minister igor chudinov signed a governmental plan through <num>2010</num>  on the prevention of the spread of religious extremism ,  fundamentalism ,  the activities of the religious-extremist party hisb ut-tahrir and religious-based conflicts . 
the main objective of this plan is to carry out a coordinated interdepartmental fight against terrorism and extremism . 
the countrys parliament introduced changes to the criminal code to stiffen punishment for inciting national ,  religious and interregional hostility . 
deputies proposed an increase in fines from us$1 , 250 to <num>2,500</num>  $  , and also criminal responsibility of up to three years imprisonment . 
the law is now awaiting approval by the president .

pakistani troops come under fire from taliban
armed members of the pakistani taliban walk on a street in the buner district ,  about <num>60</num>  miles  ( <num>96.5</num>  km )  from islamabad on april <num>23</num>  .
islamabad - a van carrying pakistani frontier corps security forces through the buner district ,  only <num>60</num>  miles  ( <num>96.5</num>  km )  from the capital ,  came under fire by taliban forces on april <num>23</num>  .
one police official was killed and another wounded ,  authorities said . 
the takeover of buner brings the taliban closer to the capital ,  islamabad ,  than it has been since the insurgency started . 
the militants said they took control of the buner district to ensure that islamic law ,  or sharia ,  was properly imposed . 
the pakistani government called the advance into the district a breach of a recently signed peace agreement . 
residents of buner said the militants had set up checkpoints and were patrolling streets throughout the district . 
taliban militants implemented islamic law in pakistan's violence-plagued swat valley last week ,  before taking control of the neighbouring buner district . 
taliban fighters moved into the swat valley as part of a peace deal with the government that has come under fire from western observers .

dushanbe - tajikistan is ready to supply water to neighbouring countries during the irrigation season and meet its obligations under international agreements . 
abdurauf latipov ,  an irrigation and water resource ministry expert on inter-border rivers ,  said that before the end of april the kairakum reservoir will release <num>300</num>  to <num>600</num>  cubic metres of water per second to uzbekistan . 
kairakum hydroelectric plant director faizullo avezov said the reservoir currently contains <num>3.5</num>  billion cubic metres of water which ,  during the irrigation season ,  will provide water for more than <num>300,000</num>  hectares in uzbekistan sown to cotton and <num>80,000</num>  hectares of rice fields in kazakhstan . 
uzbekistan has met its obligation and supplied electricity to northern tajikistan last winter when the kairakum plant stood idle ,  he said . 
uzbekistan supplied <num>839.4</num>  million kilowatt hours of electricity to tajikistan worth us$12 . 6 million during the first quarter of this year . 
analysts said the central asian countries are working toward coming up with new mechanisms to coordinate the use of water and electrical power resources in the region now experiencing high demands for electricity and water shortages . 
tajik political analyst abdugan mamadazimov said that coordination between tajikistan and uzbekistan is particularly critical . 
the current intergovernmental agreement that provides <num>600</num>  million kilowatt hours in exchange for <num>900</num>  million kilowatt hours ,  which the countries sign each year ,  means that during the summer tajikistan more than compensates uzbekistan for its surplus electricity which it supplies tajikistan during the winter . 
terror threats wipe out us$1 . 62 billion from karachi stock exchange
traders watch falling prices in the trading hall at the karachi stock exchange  ( kse )  . 
 ( reuters ) 
karachi - the reports of terror attacks in karachi wiped out us$1 . 62 billion from the karachi stock exchange  ( kse )  in just four trading sessions during the last week of april ,  brokers said . 
the reports of the penetration of terrorists into karachi in the backdrop of a fresh military operation against terrorists in the north western frontier province  ( nwfp )  triggered selling pressure ,  said ahmed nabil ,  the chief operating officer . 
foreign investors withdrew another <num>14</num>  $  million from the stock market this week and created panic among local investors who sold their shares in haste . 
nabil said that from october <num>2008</num>  to april <num>2009</num>  , foreign investors have pulled out <num>450</num>  $  million worth of investments from pakistans stock market . 
the threat of terror attacks and ethnic clashes in karachi spoiled the earlier bullish sentiment of the market ,  said an official at capital creative securities . 
the daily turnover of shares at the kse has declined to below <num>200</num>  million shares at the end of april . 
lahore and islamabad sources also witnessed a recession in trading . 
other brokers said small investors suffered heavy losses in april because of selling pressure . 
the stock market showed a robust growth of <num>40</num>  percent last week ,  but security agencies warning of attacks in karachi and lower than expected corporate earnings eroded positive sentiment . 
some financial experts believe the government should cease peace talks and agreements with terrorists and launch more aggressive military action to maintain peace in pakistan .

established in <num>1908</num>  , cairo university was the secular answer to the regional dominance of al-azhar university . 
through an exchange of egyptian and european scholars ,  it became an intellectual bridge between east and west .

nbrc director burkhoniddin bakhovaddinov said that there was a period when the number of blood donors in the country fell sharply ,  but now the situation is stabilising . 
according to bakhovaddinov ,  blood service facilities are experiencing difficulties because of inadequate financing ,  which prevents them from expanding their facilities and modernising their equipment ,  especially automatic blood separators . 
still ,  with the help of the global fund to combat hiv ,  tuberculosis and malaria ,  three regional blood centres have been provided with modern laboratory equipment for immunoenzymometric blood testing ,  he said .

uzbekistan - twelve members of the womens arm of the forbidden hizb ut tahrir party in uzbekistan have been sentenced to various prison terms . 
the tashkent district criminal court handed down the ruling against the female militants of this forbidden fundamentalist organisation . 
the uzbek authorities have accused the hizb ut tahrir party of anti-government activity ,  violating the constitutional system ,  sowing ethnic and religious discord ,  and terrorism . 
the organisation is banned in other central asian countries ,  russia ,  germany ,  and two arab countries . 
news agencies said the militants were accused of infringing on the uzbek constitutional system ,  forming forbidden extremist religious organisations and distributing materials posing a threat to public safety in the country . 
an anonymous law enforcement source said many relatives of the sentenced women are also in prison on charges of involvement in the underground organisation . 
this is not the first time hizb ut tahrir militants have been on trial . 
last june ,  <num>40</num> -year-old ugila mirzayeva and <num>37</num> -year-old rano akhrorkhodzhayev were each sentenced to five years in prison in tashkent region .

four more female former members of the organisation were sentenced to three to five years in prison on july <num>28</num>  in the southern city of denau . 
local and international human rights activists have frequently reported violations of religious freedoms in uzbekistan and unsubstantiated sentences for supposed members of extremist organisations . 
unofficial reports say several thousand people have been sentenced to prison for their religious beliefs .

last february the kyrgyz parliament voted to close the base at president kurmanbek bakievs suggestion . 
kyrgyz foreign minister kadyrbek sarbaev said the country reconsidered its decision because of the worsening situation in afghanistan and pakistan and appeals from foreign heads of state .

sources in kyrgyz parliament say that the payment for the shipment centre will be us$60 million .

the simulated disaster ,  an earthquake in the city of kurgan-tyube in tajikistan's south-west ,  claimed the lives of <num>75,000</num>  virtual citizens with thousands more injured and left without shelter . 
complicating the response was a simultaneous explosion at a chemical factory elsewhere in the country ,  followed by a terrorist attack . 
in the face of these disasters ,  tajikistan's team called on its central asian neighbours and international and non-government organisations for assistance . 
according to zarif bobakalonov ,  second in command of tajikistan's general staff ,  the designers of the simulation wanted to include exercises that involved border security ,  illegal migration and drug trafficking . 
 " in drawing up our goals for the exercise ,  we realised that natural disasters and similar emergencies know no borders ,  "  he said . 
 " only by working together can we confront those challenges .  " 
the regional cooperation exercise was born out of the centrazbat exercise in <num>1997</num>  .
since that time ,  similar exercises were conducted in germany in <num>2004</num>  , the <abbr>u.s.</abbr>  in <num>2005</num>  , kyrgyzstan in <num>2006</num>  and <num>2008</num>  and kazakhstan in <num>2007</num>  .

pakistanis fear of terrorist attacks eclipses pre-eid shopping
recent attacks in nwfp markets have claimed hundreds of lives and terrorised people throughout the country ,  said azam khan ,  a shopkeeper at the ashiyana clothes market in karachi . 
the few customers who show up leave the market a few minutes later amid security fears . 
our daily sale these days is <num>40</num>  to <num>60</num>  percent less than what we earned a couple of days ahead of eid holidays last year ,  said rashid ali ,  a shopkeeper in karachi . 
terrorist attacks in the nwfp ,  islamabad ,  rawalpindi and lahore have eclipsed pre-eid shopping festivities throughout pakistan ,  which will bring big losses to merchants this year . 
traders have hired extra security guards ,  but customers are still fearful of suicide attacks ,  he added . 
animal markets are also deserted . 
people usually start buying animals a month ahead of eid-ul-azha ,  but not this year ,  muhammad tariq ,  a resident of karachi said . 
security fears and price hikes are keeping buyers away from the animal markets . 
violent extremists are the enemy of humanity and they must be eliminated from pakistan forever ,  he asserted . 
the present olympic stadium with <num>30,000</num>  seats will become the centre of a future sports city .

islamabad-pakistani troops killed at least <num>10</num>  taliban fighters april <num>26</num>  in a military operation to slow the march of extremists across pakistans north-west frontier province  ( nwfp )  . 
there is growing concern around the world about the stability of the nuclear-armed country . 
muhammad iqbal ,  a senior official with the pro-taliban movement for the enforcement of sharia law ,  confirmed the deaths of <num>10</num>  militants including a commander he named as shahid . 
the dir operation fuelled speculation of a broader military drive in the coming days and could signal the collapse of a controversial peace deal signed in february . 
under the deal ,  the taliban were supposed to disarm in return for pakistan government permission to impose sharia law in malakand division ,  a sprawling area that covers one-third of the nwfp . 
instead ,  the militants have used their sanctuary in swat to conduct raids into neighbouring districts such as shangla ,  dir and buner ,  which is just <num>100</num>  km from islamabad . 
in response to international outrage ,  taliban leader maulana fazlullah withdrew a large portion of his troops from buner on april <num>25</num>  .

tajik theatres to promote moderation in family celebrations
lavish weddings ,  which are customary according to local traditions ,  often spell financial disaster for families . 
 ( photo by china photos / getty images ) 
the law ,  passed in <num>2007</num>  , prohibits the holding of celebrations and feasts on the occasion of appointments to public office or the awarding of rank ,  titles ,  state prizes or academic science and special degrees . 
the law also restricts the ways in which personal events such as weddings ,  funeral banquets and birthdays are celebrated . 
it prescribes the number of guests admissible at such events ,  when they can be scheduled and how long they can last . 
according to tajik president rahmon ,  the country has saved more than us$710 million since the law was passed . 
he said that in the first quarter of this year alone ,  more than <num>12,000</num>  head of cattle were saved from being slaughtered for ceremonies and that legal restrictions led to <num>5,000</num>  more weddings being held this year compared to the same period last year . 
tajikistan communist party president shodi shabdolov highlighted the importance of the social and demographic consequences of the law as well as its economic ramifications . 
extravagant celebrations have often led to the break-up of families by burdening people with massive long-term debts ,  he commented . 
representatives of a number of political parties in tajikistan believe the law constitutes an infringement of constitutional rights and unwarranted interference in the private lives of citizens .

osce to provide assistance for national minorities in tajikistan
there are <num>120</num>  nationalities and peoples living in tajikistan who constitute <num>20</num>  percent of the nation's population of <num>7</num>  million . 
the largest groups are russians ,  uzbeks ,  kyrgyz ,  turkmen and tatars . 
according to the tajikistan minority association ,  the population of national minorities has decreased by <num>700,000</num>  since <num>1989</num>  , as almost half of non-natives emigrated from the republic . 
on the other hand ,  expert anvar boyev contends that the main problem of national minorities in the country is their lack of knowledge of the tajik language ,  which creates a multitude of social and everyday barriers . 
for example ,  she said ,  a particular problem for russians is the psychological barrier that comes from their denial that they are no longer the predominant people in tajikistan ,  as they were during the soviet era .

naval chief addresses war college
during his remarks on june <num>10</num>  , bashir said ,  the sea has always been a major reservoir of resources and offers extensive opportunities to promote national interests . 
it also poses challenges in the form of threats that could imperil national security . 
threats to maritime security emanate from inter-state territorial disputes ,  political instabilities and transnational crimes including maritime terrorism ,  piracy ,  human smuggling and drugs arms trafficking . 
this has led to the contemporary concept of collaborative maritime security . 
the naval chief emphasised that the indian ocean is home to some of the worlds most important choke points and sea lines of communication . 
consequently ,  maritime security and the stability of the north arabian sea have attained greater significance with respect to freedom of navigation and uninterrupted flow of trade . 
he said the seas are absolutely essential for pakistans economic health and the sustenance of daily life . 
this means ,  bahir argued ,  that the country must maintain an effective naval response within the limits of its resources . 
the pakistan navy ,  to be an effective instrument of our defence and foreign policies ,  should be capable of defending the maritime frontiers of our country ,  showing presence in our areas of interest ,  enhancing pakistans image globally and increasing our influence over regional countries .

president of kyrgyzstan unveils major government reforms
kyrgyzstan - on september <num>1</num>  , in an address to parliament ,  president kurmanbek bakiyev announced major reforms in his administration and government . 
during his election campaign ,  the recently re-elected head of state harshly criticised both and promised to implement changes if he won the election . 
the president's plans include the reorganisation of the presidential institute and changes in the structure and function of the government ,  law enforcement and judicial agencies . 
they also foresee the creation of a new military doctrine and economic reforms . 
the changes will streamline budget preparation ,  provide support for businesses and business ownership and facilitate effective management of public resources . 
the current system of administration ,  according to bakiyev ,  remains mired in soviet-era mindsets and work methods . 
the president emphasised that decision-making and methods of providing government services are almost entirely outdated ,  and based on a system of bureaucratic kickbacks and favours . 
bakiyev strongly criticised the ministers who attended his appearance before parliament stating that the inefficiency of the state machine ,  corruption ,  and a senseless waste of resources are the consequences of a lack of resolution by ministers to eradicate these problems . 
the kyrgyz head of state also emphasised that all talk of a supposed dissolution of parliament by <num>2009</num>  was unthinkable and completely false .

a water doctrine for central asia
one way of using water resources efficiently would be to create a system to prevent the risk of water-related natural disasters by building new hydroelectric power stations ,  the reservoirs of which would store the necessary volume of water and electricity and also lower the risk of flooding . 
central asia has been experiencing annual water shortages for several years now ,  and this is having a negative impact on the economies of the region ,  orifov said . 
all the countries in the lower reaches of the region -uzbekistan ,  turkmenistan and kazakhstan - must bear an equal share of the costs currently being borne only by tajikistan and kyrgyzstan ,  the countries where the regions water resources originate . 
sar-e-pul residents unite to protect schools

i liked studying very much but unfortunately was never able to complete my education ,  he said . 
it is a good opportunity for children to study because they are the future of afghanistan . 
the commission has quickly spread through several districts of sar-e-pul and has been supported by local police forces . 
provincial deputy governor haj ebrahimi explained :  besides controlling the governmental departments ,  the important task for us is to take care of the schools and the students in our province . 
meanwhile in balk province ,  an improved security condition is very much appreciated by schoolteachers . 
ustad mohammad karim of nor-e khoda primary school in mazar-e sharif explained :  without security ,  education cannot move forward in this country . 
international organisations have provided assistance to a number of local schools by donating school supplies and furniture . 
expressing his gratefulness for such donations ,  schoolteacher ghulam farooq said :  there were not any chairs or benches in our school for a long time ,  but day by day our education system is becoming more developed . 
years of war left afghanistans education system shattered . 
under king zahir shahs rule from <num>1933</num>  to <num>1973</num>  , over half of afghan children under <num>12</num>  were enrolled in primary school . 
large investments were made to expand secondary schools and improve the national university in kabul . 
however ,  after the russian invasion in <num>1979</num>  , and the years of war that followed ,  the countrys education system was virtually destroyed . 
only a few hundred functioning schools existed in the entire country when the taliban took over in <num>1996</num>  .
the regime banned female education and religious schools became the main source of education in the country . 
since the fall of the taliban in <num>2001</num>  , thousands of schools have reopened .

in the neighbouring lower dir district ,  the scene of the april <num>25</num> -<num>26</num>  fighting ,  the military said that at least <num>47</num>  people ,  mostly militants ,  had been killed . 
the fighting pits militants against the frontier corps paramilitary police unit backed by army helicopter gun-ships and artillery . 
the district had been cleared of militants ,  according to acting interior ministry chief rehman malik ,  but residents said clashes were still taking place . 
lower dir bridges the mountains between swat and the afghan border . 
pakistani officials fear the route could be used to move taliban fighters from mountain bases near the afghan border to within striking distance of pakistan's plains ,  where most of its <num>170</num>  million people live and its industry is concentrated . 
pakistani media reported that as many as <num>20,000</num>  people had fled the fighting in lower dir . 
a senior official said only women ,  children and elderly men were being allowed to leave the district to keep taliban fighters from slipping out with the refugees . 
 " we can have no agreements with the government because it is not a government for pakistani people . 
it is a government for the americans "  ,  said muslim khan ,  a spokesman for the taliban in swat .

young tahir is among the many students who ran away from a madrasa because of everyday physical abuse . 
i wanted to become a hafiz but physical torture drove me away from my dream . 
a child is inclined to immoral acts while getting religious education because of satans influence . 
in <num>2005</num>  , the punjab government banned corporal punishment in schools ,  but it overlooked madrasas where harsh corporal punishment is fairly common across all of pakistan . 
we should change this culture under the supervision of scholars ,  abidullah ghazi recommended . 
pakistan madrasas lack a scientific methodology to educate students who are being taught <num>200</num> -year-old courses that are irrelevant to present age requirements . 
although parents want a safe environment for their children ,  application of physical force generates a profound ,  negative impact on the attitude of young people and also disrupts the learning process ,  tasneema said . 
the very thought of having classes makes them tremble . 
and while the teachers proclaim their intent is to scourge sin out of students ,  the beatings are administered to pre-teens and children still learning to read . 
use of corporal punishment in islamic schools literally means to beat the devil out of children "  ,  tasneema said .
